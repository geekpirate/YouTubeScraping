_7wSQPXagYk,Well happy birthday!
pZSjm0drIGM,Yes bc my baby isn’t doing anything a 12 month old should
pZSjm0drIGM,Yes
pZSjm0drIGM,@meme ali Thank you
pZSjm0drIGM,Cute   🐀
pZSjm0drIGM,@Kristen Johnson thank you
pZSjm0drIGM,OMG she&#39;s adorable!
pZSjm0drIGM,Hu to hf
pZSjm0drIGM,The reason for someone to have kids is that she will never feel alone? It sounds to me problematic.
pZSjm0drIGM,"Lala in the 1st sentence you say, &#39;this literally gives me anxiety&#39; yet in the last sentence you say, &#39;don&#39;t fall down that trap&#39;. If this gives you anxiety arent you in fact falling down that trap? I believe every child is different.  That I agree with you 100%"
pZSjm0drIGM,"@Jezuz why Freak out? Every child, as every adult is different."
pZSjm0drIGM,My child is 14 months old and doesn’t say a single word. He doesn’t do any of what was said on this video. Doesn’t point at things or follow along with books. I’m freaking out 😥
pZSjm0drIGM,Same here my child is 15 months old but she does says 3-4 words but still im worried she dont talk much
pZSjm0drIGM,It’s about encouraging children not discourage parents.🤦‍♀️
pZSjm0drIGM,"@wisegamer 3.0 Damn. That’s real. My baby doesn’t talk yet, but at 1 she can stand and sit on her own."
pZSjm0drIGM,@Mariah Stokes right 😂 strange how people completely miss the point of these videos. There’s kids who develop faster or slower than the average. The job of the parent is to help them get to where they need to so they’re closer to the average if they’re tracking slower.
pZSjm0drIGM,Yeh they should be close to that number otherwise they are behind..need extra help..this isn&#39;t talking directly to a child and discouraging them what are you even talking about lol
pZSjm0drIGM,Thank you !
pZSjm0drIGM,You’re so sweet 💓
pZSjm0drIGM,Sounds about normal
pZSjm0drIGM,talk a lot to her
pZSjm0drIGM,Don&#39;t worry about it! It takes plenty of kids longer to begin speaking. Each kid is different :)
pZSjm0drIGM,"Im just watching this video because of my niece, i always babysit her almost everyday now"
pZSjm0drIGM,@zhleia had my baby in July. I feel that question lol
pZSjm0drIGM,Have your kid yet?
pZSjm0drIGM,Same bday!  Good luck!
pZSjm0drIGM,are you ready? :)
pZSjm0drIGM,@Duke Wellington you must not have kids bc kids at that age do offer to do things like that. 🙄
pZSjm0drIGM,@Duke Wellington😭😭😭😭😭
pZSjm0drIGM,My granddaughter is 15 months and she talks in sentences and helps put her toys away and asks to help put groceries away and much more. I don&#39;t remember my kids ever doing that kind of stuff at 15 months old. Its a little unnerving some times.
pZSjm0drIGM,rofl
pZSjm0drIGM,"Tony Richards mine is 2.5 and haven’t speak a word yet . No pointing, or respond to name,. He can solve alphabet puzzle and organize number to 20. Is watching too much tv the problem"
pZSjm0drIGM,Thanks Tony for your valuable information
pZSjm0drIGM,swathi vinoop my son is also 1 and a half and not speaking yet. I have been reading to him and pointing at things and telling him what they are. It seems to be helping but I think no matter what they talk when they are ready.
pZSjm0drIGM,"That is nothing special.  As a 30 year teacher, when parents talk to their children, read to them, and expose them to new things, they will learn."
pZSjm0drIGM,"I started to walk and spoke before 12 months, could ask questions and reply conversation before 2. And yes, im not a genius or something like  that."
pZSjm0drIGM,"@ling tang I heard that generally in all cases children starts speaking from the age of 2, on average."
pZSjm0drIGM,Android noob pro gamer I started at 2😂😂😂😂😂 is that normal?
pZSjm0drIGM,He could  have an old ear infection...get ears check out first...ask for a referral  to a specialist of your concerns...<br><br>Helped me...<br><br>God Bless Parents🙏...<br><br>From.a Parent  from Brooklyn N.Y.😊<br><br>God Bless You All🙏💛😊🙏
pZSjm0drIGM,Always Pull out if you have the chance
pZSjm0drIGM,me too hahaha
pZSjm0drIGM,"This is just superb, I&#39;ve been looking for &quot;reading rockets&quot; for a while now, and I think this has helped. You ever tried - Miyohn Keybigail Idea - (search on google )? <br><br>It is an awesome one of a kind product for learning how to teach your child to read minus the normal expense. Ive heard some unbelievable things about it and my colleague got excellent success with it."
pZSjm0drIGM,😂
pZSjm0drIGM,How is your baby doing now?? My 15mo doesn&#39;t wave point or talk...
pZSjm0drIGM,"Clarissa Martinez every kid is different. Mine starting attempting to walk at 9ish months, my friends’ started at 12ish months and the other started 14ish."
pZSjm0drIGM,Are you asking or bragging?
pZSjm0drIGM,"Elizabeth Hernandez my sister watches cocomelon , word party , etc"
pZSjm0drIGM,@elly like what shows
pZSjm0drIGM,Elizabeth Hernandez watch tv shows with a lot of music cartoons and visual
pZSjm0drIGM,my sister does too
pZSjm0drIGM,Dr. Ana Maria Libao early intervention would be her best bet let her pediatrician know your concerns
pZSjm0drIGM,Thank you for sharing!!!
pZSjm0drIGM,How&#39;s your baby now?
pZSjm0drIGM,@Sabatina Deniese early intervention is key. I dont think something is necessarily wrong but it could warrant investigation. Also not speaking until age 5 there was something wrong there and hopefully their parents investigated it. That&#39;s a school aged child.
pZSjm0drIGM,Don’t worry I had a cousin who didn’t speak till he was 5. He or she will talk when they are ready.
pZSjm0drIGM,the cake is a lie yes you should. Good luck
pZSjm0drIGM,"I would be, but you really won&#39;t know what&#39;s up till you go see your child&#39;s doctor... I&#39;d schedule a check up soon."
pZSjm0drIGM,"@Sneha Lama so no need to worry abt tis rit? Bcoz v consulted all the doc&#39;s, everyone told he s veru active so surly he ll walk wait"
pZSjm0drIGM,"Some baby walk after 20,24month"
pZSjm0drIGM,"Sometimes I really think it&#39;s just a behavior, if the child understands what everyone else is saying then it should be ok. Could have to do with being shy. I know as an adult I get tongue tied around ppl."
pZSjm0drIGM,@Vithya I Ohh okay! Has she been teething? My nephew always loses his appetite when he was teething
pZSjm0drIGM,@Laura Francis thanks for your replay. Sorry I mentioned wrongly now my daughter is 14Months older .
pZSjm0drIGM,"At 14 weeks babies can&#39;t swallow normal food yet. You should wait until they are at least 4-6 months old before trying other foods because they have a tongue thrust reflex that won&#39;t allow them to eat solids. Your baby will tell you when they are ready, when they can sit up on their own and when they stop pushing food out of their mouth with their tongue then you can start on baby foods and when they are willing to chew you can add other things as well. Though their diet should still be mostly milk at that point as you slowly ween them and start on regular foods"
pZSjm0drIGM,Phonotical ...
pZSjm0drIGM,"@marcela abade me research, can you even read??"
pZSjm0drIGM,Phonotical again... do a little more research it was proven that W sitting is nothing bad
pZSjm0drIGM,"@marcela abade I have, as have medical professionals and health care workers, doctors and scientists, the words, hip displasia, did not come out of thin air."
pZSjm0drIGM,@Aa Mezher There&#39;s obviously a language barrier here. No need to be obtuse.
pZSjm0drIGM,Arrogant = hyperactive/energetic ? <br>Since when ?
pZSjm0drIGM,@Laura Francis Thanks for your suggestion
pZSjm0drIGM,"@Neelam Paudel Ohh, don&#39;t worry too much. If she is a little too energetic then be sure to give her time to run around or things to do with her hands helps too! My nephew who is 15 months is very intelligent and energetic too but at times a lot to handle. Sometimes just going on a walk or having him walk up and down the stairs will help"
pZSjm0drIGM,@Laura Francis I think she is hyperactive
pZSjm0drIGM,No bragging please. Lots of parents here are concerned that their children hadn&#39;t reached the milestone.
pZSjm0drIGM,Dana 91 totally normal! That’s great!
pZSjm0drIGM,My son started walking at 14 and half month. Hope that helps.
pZSjm0drIGM,@Cece Ruben walking without support.
pZSjm0drIGM,"@Cece Ruben Prewalking is not walking, it&#39;s being able to shift weight between feet. And the original commenter never even mentioned whether their child can stand on their own or not."
pZSjm0drIGM,@Cece Ruben Personal experience is not proof. If you want to claim that 80% of children are walking by their first birthday then give me a source.
pZSjm0drIGM,"@Cece Ruben No, it&#39;s 50% walking at 12 months, that&#39;s not late it&#39;s normal. Some children don&#39;t even walk until 15 or 16 months"
pZSjm0drIGM,Was there any change? My son is 1.5 yrs old and he can make letter sounds and baby talks our ears off but not many words and if so he says them randomly and we won’t hear it again for a while.. was she just a late bloomer? Btw I do speak Spanish to him as well
pZSjm0drIGM,"Hi everyone! This is totally normal, children who are bilingual might take a little longer to start speaking, but keep making sure their receptive language is age appropriate! I will be posting a video on this soon!"
pZSjm0drIGM,I&#39;m in the same situation. My son is also 1yrs old and 5 months &amp; I worry too if my son should be talking already but every baby is different and even though he don&#39;t actually say words I know he understands and is smart. He picks things up when I tell him to. He listens to what I say most of the time. He also pretends like he knows how to use the remote lol we speak to him in Spanish and English and he understands what we&#39;re telling him in both languages. He baby talks alot but doesn&#39;t actually say words. I feel like he&#39;ll learn soon enough tho. I know he wants to use actual words because he baby talks alot.
pZSjm0drIGM,Thorazine Farms Remembers same with my baby he is 18 months and he just knows like 2 words. But is it normal ??
pZSjm0drIGM,@Thorazine Farms Remembers I hearya..we are worry warts too 😀 Stay positive and keep loving her and it will all come together 😎👍
pZSjm0drIGM,and they also become 2 years old at the same time
pZSjm0drIGM,"Does he have clear words he uses often?My baby is 16 months old and has about 8 words he uses regularly, they all are people. Try to repeat words, a good 5 that you want him to get custom to saying. If you want him to speak two languages, speak one language at home and then put his music or videos in another language. I also learned that putting a lot of videos, of music and also coco melon is really good for their cognitive learning. Also for the food part, some kids are just like that. I see when my baby doesn’t want to eat anything, I first eat it and then give to his father. Babies love to imitate others, and <br>he always ends up eating it. Don’t worry every kid develops at a different pace, these are just some things to try applying to your child that I saw worked. You think they will never talk, but one day they just start repeating words like “Mami” because they hear that word a lot. Just keep practicing and make it fun."
pZSjm0drIGM,It’s ok my son drunk a lot of milk up until 2 and he liked the little baby food pouches sometimes. He’s now 3 eats everything. He also didn’t speak until 18 months.even though he’s doing fine I’m still a worrier.
pZSjm0drIGM,Same 😤
pZSjm0drIGM,"He could just be teething, my nephew who is 14 months won&#39;t eat much when his teeth hurt. If he is pulling on his ears or putting his hands in his mouth then its probably just a tooth coming in and you shouldn&#39;t worry too much. If not then just keep trying, babies have preferences like everyobody else and they change their minds easily"
pZSjm0drIGM,zee matt wow I came here Iam bawling my eyes out my ten months I worry for him but he seems Normal
pZSjm0drIGM,Dr. Laura Markham is awesome.
pZSjm0drIGM,It applies to all children.
pZSjm0drIGM,My daughter became quiet when we moved to NYC.  I asked her why and she said that my family was speaking too fast and that she didn’t understand them.  I found this out when she was three.
pZSjm0drIGM,"I speak English and Spanish to my son and he wont stop talking. He speaks to me when he wants something,using clear words in Spanish or english. The rest of the time he speak gibberish to me and I always answer back like I know what he saying. This encourages him to talk because he knows I am always listening"
pZSjm0drIGM,Aa Mezher <br>That doesn’t effect language.
pZSjm0drIGM,"I think it all depends on your child. Some kids just don’t want to talk but they understand and communicate in different ways. My daughter is 2.5 she can speak Portuguese and English. I though her Portuguese first but when she went to daycare she learned English quite fast. She’s very verbal. My son is 1.5 and only says mama, not verbal at all, but he points, babbles and makes faces to communicate. Hope this helps"
pZSjm0drIGM,@Yolannda Mayo really lol.. Grind the Quran and give it in baby food probably cure all the problems 😏😒
pZSjm0drIGM,@Yolannda Mayo You must be joking.
pZSjm0drIGM,No go to a doctor not a mosque if you want your child to progress it is absolutely not normal that they can’t sit up and you’re going to cause more harm by delaying intervention
pZSjm0drIGM,@Sayyad Saleem1989 Assalamualakuim my suggestion to you as a muslim is to refer to the Quran and have your baby listen to rokya sharia. Rokya sharia is cure or healing by Qur&#39;an recitation and dua from the sunnah..Allah says he put shifa (cure)  imside the Quran for the believer..please do that and i will also make dua for your baby inshallah
pZSjm0drIGM,Yes sister I am Muslim

IhcgYgx7aAA,Bot
IhcgYgx7aAA,"I&#39;ve always felt the emphasis on standardized test scores at early ages never accepts Piaget&#39;s theories. We rush to assess students and define their learning when they ate at a place where learning is still so new. We also can&#39;t assess what is taught or emphasized within the home and at school. Many children get extra hours of support at home and that spurs learning more quickly and, perhaps, more easily. Children who lack that support will need more time"
IhcgYgx7aAA,Yes?

Be aware of the fact that you are also yourself through your actual eyes.

Do ALL this from the first person. <br>Trust me, once you do this, you will be scared, don’t think about anything else though, and stop immediately after you feel scared, sick, weird, or whatever it is.<br>It makes you feel small, but you also realise that each person (every human) that you thought of is unknowing of your existence, but you are aware of them all, at least within that small amount of time.<br><br>This daydream freaks me out and it’s hard to think of properly, good luck on your journey!<br>Also, if you can, try and imagine some of them street passing each other or even talking to one another, NEVER ISOLATE EVERY PERSON, only allow for some or a lot to be quarantined, not all."
IhcgYgx7aAA,You think you&#39;re part of a hive mind?<br><br>I&#39;m not sure what you mean by this? 🤔
IhcgYgx7aAA,"Lets go! for a walk, lol"
IhcgYgx7aAA,😭😭😭 mee toooo
IhcgYgx7aAA,Seriously.
IhcgYgx7aAA,Your English is fine
IhcgYgx7aAA,@77ranko connect what dots?
IhcgYgx7aAA,"@77ranko I dont get what you&#39;re trying to say. I&#39;m just stating that BOTH theories are probably correct. Ones based moreso on the social constructs, and the other is based more on brain maturity."
IhcgYgx7aAA,"@77ranko I am definitely not a child trapped in an adult body. I think infantilization is one of the worst things of the 20th century (see Teen 2.0). However, after watching the video it really seems to almost not have anything to do with what Piaget came up with. Piagets work HAS been duplicated worldwide in every culture, with the same results. Of course certain people in certain age groups may be able to reach certain operational stages at certain ages. You&#39;re video is just saying that socially constructed items like speech and learning are needed to advance a human being which is absolutely correct. However, until about age 12, a human being can only do so much with what is learned. Like I said, your video has more to do with social constructs and maturity (which is fine), and mine has to dow moreso with the brain stage that utilizes those constructs."
IhcgYgx7aAA,"@77ranko Vygotsky has more do do with maturity through the construct or socialization. Piaget on the other hand is about neurological maturity. I doubt that Vygotsky dismisses Piaget, and Piagets research isnt going to be debunked any time soon, as his results have been duplicated across the entire globe. I think they&#39;re a bit of apples and oranges."
IhcgYgx7aAA,@77ranko what do you mean?

IhcgYgx7aAA,Welcome Nikhil. Glad you notice!
IhcgYgx7aAA,"Guys, Piaget&#39;s stages of cognitive development are something almost everyone goes through, even most people who  suffer from mental disorders. You don&#39;t &quot;conquer&quot; them like this video says, you just go through them. These aren&#39;t phases one gets stuck in, like maybe Erikson&#39;s or  Kohlberg&#39;s."
IhcgYgx7aAA,"Yep. That tune is driving me nuts. It&#39;s a gross generalisation. As if all of us have an above average IQ. Lots of people I know are largely stuck in the infant stage, and western society breeds egocentrism."
IhcgYgx7aAA,Especially the public school system...
IhcgYgx7aAA,"If the theory is not true (in other words, if there are more than 4 stages, including stages that go beyond what the theory accounts for), then is it possible that to a stage 4 person, a stage 5 or 6 person, would look like a stage 3 does to a stage 2?<br><br><br>Eg, a stage 2 person says: &quot;No that&#39;s wrong, the truth is those glasses of water now have different amounts, because that one is taller&quot;.<br>Is it possible that a stage 4 person would look at a stage 5 person, and say &quot;Your way of seeing the world is not like mine, and since mine is the most complex I can imagine, yours must be less complex and below mine&quot;?<br>Without realizing that the lack of agreement is due to their own cognitive inadequacy, not the other person&#39;s?"

gnArvcWaH6I,I&#39;ve watched the video and... i guess children are not very good with 2d and the only thing they measure is length (=width or height)<br>interesting
gnArvcWaH6I,might be because you&#39;re 16 and he&#39;s 6?
gnArvcWaH6I,"@M GM Yeah, in this video and others, I&#39;m seeing comments saying this was just a poorly simplified recreation of the original studies."
gnArvcWaH6I,"@Andrew Kovnatif that&#39;s the case, she did a really bad job with using  the suggestive wording in her questions like, &quot;is it longer or the same?&quot; instead of &quot;is it longer, shorter, the same or no change?&quot; and she shouldn&#39;t have agreed to the answers  with &quot;okay&quot; or by nodding her head on some of the child&#39;s answers, making the child believe they were right or wrong. <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23shameful"">#Shameful</a>."
gnArvcWaH6I,"Because it&#39;s a study. She&#39;s not there to teach him, she&#39;s there to record his responses."
gnArvcWaH6I,"@Equinox Yes, that&#39;s true.  The fact that the child changes his answer about the coins after counting does indicate that he was, at that point, interpreting the question in terms of the number of coins.  I&#39;m not sure, though, that the child&#39;s conception of what was begin asked wasn&#39;t changing in real time.  It seemed apparent from context that the interviewer intended for him to change his original answer.  Otherwise why have him count and then ask again?  I think I would have inferred that I was expected to change my answer.  And that is how children learn language; i.e., by watching carefully to see how adults are using terms, and adjusting their own understanding in real time accordingly. <br>   My point in asking this question, btw, is not to criticize anyone or anything, but simply to ask what can and can not be ruled out logically from what this kind of experiment shows."
gnArvcWaH6I,"@brindlebriar Obviously they don&#39;t have the same understanding and/or interpretation of conservation of matter. That is the point of the video, but you are  criticizing the investigator for being ambiguous with their definition of &quot;more&quot; , which the kids could have misinterpreted and thus answered incorrectly, however that wasn&#39;t the case since the investigator explicitly asked the subject to count the number of quarters and asked them again the exact same question. If they misunderstood the definition of &quot;more&quot; they wouldn&#39;t have changed their answer after counting the quarters. That means they understood what the investigator meant by &quot;more quarters&quot;. They counted them for both questions actually."
gnArvcWaH6I,"@Equinox The first time, the second row wasn&#39;t bigger, so the kid said they are the same size.  The second time it was bigger.  You and the adults are thinking &#39;has more quarters&quot; means &quot;has a larger numeric quantity of quarter-dollar units.&quot;   But if the kid is thinking &quot;has more quarters&quot; means something like &quot;the quarters are taking up more space&quot; the child&#39;s answers are correct per his interpretation of the question.<br>   I&#39;m not saying that <i>is</i> the case, but that nothing in the video appears to rule it out."
gnArvcWaH6I,"I mean the investigator controlled for that in the very first clip. The subject was asked which row had more quarters, gave the wrong answer, asked to count then asked again which row had more quarters then gave the correct answer."
gnArvcWaH6I,LOL!
gnArvcWaH6I,이쯤 되면 막 가자는 거지요
gnArvcWaH6I,only in the imaginary land of fox news: Strawmania
gnArvcWaH6I,He was <i>onto her.</i>
gnArvcWaH6I,"i would ace it bro, try me"
gnArvcWaH6I,"I feel like that&#39;s an adult thing to do, the kid doesn&#39;t have an ego yet that he could &quot;damage&quot; by changing his mind."
gnArvcWaH6I,what the actual fuck is the correlation lmao
gnArvcWaH6I,"The way I&#39;ve seen this phenomenon worded implies that the children think the properties keep changing (and I suppose that would match up with the way he talks about the playdough). But you&#39;re right, it&#39;s not clear when they think the properties have changed between questions, and when they&#39;re just reassessing their previous guesses based on new information.<br>In my interpretation of the coins task, the kid makes two assessments based on visual similarity first, then uses the more careful process of counting and knows to rely on that information over the less accurate visual estimations. But we never really know when he thinks the amounts have changed, and when he&#39;s re-assessing his earlier guess (or if children at that age bother to keep earlier guesses in their memory at all). It would be nice to have more in-depth questions, but that&#39;d probably exhaust the child quickly.<br>I did wonder if this maybe means that children at that age are loads less susceptible, or even invulnerable to confirmation bias... Our abilities that children of that age lack can be worded as &quot;knowing when to stop testing/re-assessing&quot;. But do we actually know as well as we assume we do?"
gnArvcWaH6I,damn bro you got the whole squad laughing 😐😐😐😐
gnArvcWaH6I,"@M I M I No, I&#39;m serious."
gnArvcWaH6I,"OK, but are we to assume that every kid understands the task and has a reason to answer incorrectly?<br><br>Because these results happen most of the time, you know."
gnArvcWaH6I,"Exactly. Kids are much smarter than we give them credit for. I was such a smart ass, even at this kids age. Lol I thought I was better than everyone else cause I colored in the lines and didn’t put the sun in the corner of the page, or made the earth’s ground EXTREMELY round in my drawings. I thought I was elite lmao"

gnArvcWaH6I,bro what
gnArvcWaH6I,No. The kid as a non complete brain. This is how every  kids of this age (included you when you were this age) should respond.
gnArvcWaH6I,Yes you are.
gnArvcWaH6I,"He could be like, why is she even asking she just moved the coins apart, then he feels forced to answer something, he&#39;s basically just trying to guess what the lady wants to hear."
gnArvcWaH6I,Those experiments where made to understand how a kids&#39;s brain work at every age. Those experiments are used by teachers all over the world
gnArvcWaH6I,The real study is if stress causes early hair loss.

gnArvcWaH6I,"Those experiments are not made to teach the kids what&#39;s wrong or not here, they  were made to understand how a kids&#39;s brain work at every age. Those experiments are used by teachers all over the world."
gnArvcWaH6I,"@sanserof7 They are not stupid, their brain is just no finished yet. This is how a healthy intelligent kid is at this age."
gnArvcWaH6I,"Lol, glad I’m not the only one who thinks about weird things like this."
gnArvcWaH6I,"especially asking him questions and nodding &#39;oh, great&#39; when the answer is wrong seems false and cruel to me"
gnArvcWaH6I,Those experiments  were made to understand how a kids&#39;s brain work at every age. They are useful and are used by teachers all over the world.
gnArvcWaH6I,@Hélène Blasquez you do not question the testing? Don&#39;t you see the negative effects?
gnArvcWaH6I,@sakura44553 Yes I do since I&#39;m a elementary school teacher in my country and had been study Piaget&#39;s work.
gnArvcWaH6I,@Hélène Blasquez 😂🤣you believe...
gnArvcWaH6I,But 4 years old you would have done the same than him
gnArvcWaH6I,Yes it is at this age. They brain is not mature enough to understand velume.

gnArvcWaH6I,this is a toddler not a child really
gnArvcWaH6I,No just a bad haircut I guess
gnArvcWaH6I,both maybe
gnArvcWaH6I,steel is heavier than feathers
gnArvcWaH6I,Next year
gnArvcWaH6I,He hasn&#39;t been given his own cell phone yet.
gnArvcWaH6I,"He isn&#39;t particularly well-behaved, he is well-engaged. An engaged child will show better &quot;preferrable&quot; behavior vs a bored child. That&#39;s why screen-time is so damaging to kids. Bad attention spans = easier boredom."
gnArvcWaH6I,"Kids tend to be pretty well behaved when mom and dad aren&#39;t around. They know exactly how far they can push parents so they tend to be a bit more conservative with others. Also, it looked like he having fun. Or at least enjoying the attention."
gnArvcWaH6I,"@Grizi  Not for me, I don&#39;t really care since I don&#39;t like alcoholic drinks, lol"
gnArvcWaH6I,@Danielle King sucks to be you guys I guess.
gnArvcWaH6I,21 in the U.S. so saying 18 still won&#39;t getcha drinks 😄
gnArvcWaH6I,yes cos 1    6 is stretched out
gnArvcWaH6I,Because it was bigger lol
gnArvcWaH6I,"I won&#39;t rewatch, but I&#39;m pretty sure she asked &quot;Does this one have more playdough? Or does this one have more playdough? Or are they the same?&quot;, not &quot;Is this one bigger&quot;"
gnArvcWaH6I,Ikr I would hit him after first wrong answer. She is very patient.
gnArvcWaH6I,impressive
gnArvcWaH6I,Because they were... typical?
gnArvcWaH6I,This kid seems too typical
gnArvcWaH6I,I don&#39;t think he can be a politician at 14 years of age.
gnArvcWaH6I,"Yeah you sure did, here take your &quot;im smort&quot; prize."
gnArvcWaH6I,"Yeah plus I am sure he is more interested in saying what he thinks she wants to hear. When she makes changes, he assumes that she wants him to say ‘more’"
gnArvcWaH6I,"Ya he doesn’t understand the nuance between different word forms of “larger”, which is really just a vocabulary issue. To a child with a limited understanding of vocabulary, his understanding of “more” may as well be “taller”"
gnArvcWaH6I,children about ages to three to five see different perspectives than adults its the whole point of this theory its psychology.
gnArvcWaH6I,That’s what I was thinking too!
gnArvcWaH6I,@Kugrox this. I’m glad someone is thinking the same thing.
gnArvcWaH6I,"@Endermax3852 well, I&#39;m a researcher too, not in this field, but I completely agree with following the scientificmethod. I am only sharing some limited, anecdotal evidence which resulted in a different outcome. At age 3.5-4, my nursery (before primary 1) had this test. And the questions were very similar. Most of my friends and I (about 15 of us)  could solve the problems. <br>I do not wish to offend anyone or question the kid&#39;s capabilities at all. I don&#39;t even know the kid&#39;s age. I am sharing my experience, which does not agree with the poor performance shown in the video. Peace."
gnArvcWaH6I,"I&#39;ll definetely believe someone who didn&#39;t do any research on this study more than hundreds of scientist working hard on this subject to learn how the human brain works and develops overtime.<br>why do i even bother, you probably were one of the below average ones."
gnArvcWaH6I,What if you were the kid that got that answer wrong?
gnArvcWaH6I,@Endermax3852 I&#39;m saying let a kid be a kid. Don&#39;t waist time singling the kid out and make him do that shit. If it wasn&#39;t all bull shit then why didn&#39;t she explain to him why he was wrong.
gnArvcWaH6I,"So you&#39;re telling me that a children does not get smarter if they study before other children, oh that&#39;s incredible, the next time i&#39;m going to have exams i will start studying the day before, there&#39;s no reason to study the whole year, since i could learn all of that in one day."
gnArvcWaH6I,Michael Scott: Can you explain it to me like I’m five
gnArvcWaH6I,😭🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😭😭😭
gnArvcWaH6I,He should
gnArvcWaH6I,"this was 11 years ago, this kid is already a grown up"
gnArvcWaH6I,@Matheus Andrade weird
gnArvcWaH6I,"Kinda like the grown up baby from the Nirvana cover album, lol."
gnArvcWaH6I,@Ben Cafeo meaning: this kid would buy anything told to him and take everything for granted. <br><br>And to think children his age are fed with religious nonsense
gnArvcWaH6I,“They are allowed to discover religion” spoken in the context you did sounds like some dystopian nonsense to me
gnArvcWaH6I,"@Mary easy, he&#39;s Einstein"
gnArvcWaH6I,@Shakester - But how did you know my name was Mary???? 😆
gnArvcWaH6I,"Guys, it’s sarcasm"
gnArvcWaH6I,You forget that not even Einstein was Einstein at birth.
gnArvcWaH6I,This experiment purpose is identify when children grows their knowledge about how size works
gnArvcWaH6I,T h a n k y o u ~ someone said it
gnArvcWaH6I,"@niffthesniff on a scale, they still weigh one kg each."
gnArvcWaH6I,@niffthesniff yeah but they weight the same
gnArvcWaH6I,but steel is heavier than feathers
gnArvcWaH6I,Yeah
gnArvcWaH6I,"Infact other experiments suggest that when the &quot;transformation&quot; is made &quot;accidentally&quot; or is  made by a different person from the person who makes the questions, than children&#39;s answers are statistically different and normally say &quot;the same&quot;. At that age adults&#39; expectations (or what children think) is the &quot;good&quot; way to behave."
gnArvcWaH6I,"I have done the water glass experiment with my niece 3 times in a row and she said the exact same thing. It is not until kids are 7 years old that they know the difference, and realize that it is the same amount of water because no water was added and it was the same amount before it was poured into a thinner glass."
gnArvcWaH6I,"So true... plus: you are asking me, are they the same now?   He must have thought, the same form? Of course they are not the same, because they have not the same form. So in a certain way, the kid is actually correct..."
gnArvcWaH6I,"Nice. I’m seeing some really smart comments hear that people aren’t shining their lights upon. Kids are smarter than we give them credit for, they’re just smart in a different way. This kid knew exactly that they were the same. He just meant “yes” as in, “yes, it has the appearance of being expanded, but it is still the same.”<br><br>My autism makes it really easy to pick up queues like this, too bad I’m shit at executing them lmao"
gnArvcWaH6I,Especially terms like &quot;fair&quot; which has many meanings. But idk. Kids are smart. Perhaps too smart for us to know how much.
gnArvcWaH6I,not really though
gnArvcWaH6I,So cute. He was having so much fun🤗
gnArvcWaH6I,@MC maybe the kid&#39;s stick will grow when he hits puberty after he reads your comment
gnArvcWaH6I,In a kid&#39;s brain everything is magic
gnArvcWaH6I,@Fred Milhome I @ you by accident
gnArvcWaH6I,Don&#39;t know I use to babysit a 4 year old and she would throw stuff at me and constantly hit me. Guess it depends on the child.
gnArvcWaH6I,Make him feel smarter than the silly lady who thinks he doesn’t know what ‘more’ is (because she touched it and asked him again and he is <i>sensing a pattern.)</i>
gnArvcWaH6I,Maybe constantly attention on the kid...
gnArvcWaH6I,Probably billions of dollars in grant money. Possibly trillions
gnArvcWaH6I,Well did you do this test when you were 4?
gnArvcWaH6I,@Rhynooooo thanks for the recommendation :)
gnArvcWaH6I,ASMR. Search for it on YouTube. It&#39;ll help you sleep.
gnArvcWaH6I,I don&#39;t think obedience equates to intelligence.
gnArvcWaH6I,"@uwu .-. Yes it is lol, children have a bad conservation knowledge, babies just do not posses it, iirc after the age of 7 they start to actually have it."
gnArvcWaH6I,@neolithic3 no
gnArvcWaH6I,"No, it&#39;s a well known experiment and in fact, adults generally think a taller thinner glass holds more liquid too."
gnArvcWaH6I,uhhh???
gnArvcWaH6I,They keep stressing him out with these damn puzzles that he&#39;s already going through a midlife crisis
gnArvcWaH6I,@Crowe3717 OK thanks for clarifying
gnArvcWaH6I,This isn&#39;t a lesson. It&#39;s an assessment we use to understand when children develop certain cognitive skills
gnArvcWaH6I,Semper Fidelis brother
gnArvcWaH6I,@Hvostik hvostik whoooosh
gnArvcWaH6I,Titan main spotted.
gnArvcWaH6I,The purple ones taste like grapes!
gnArvcWaH6I,I love the marines
gnArvcWaH6I,"Tommy is not the brightest one in the bunch, that&#39;s for sure."
gnArvcWaH6I,"@Lee Chartier I see what you mean, thanks for explaining this to me."
gnArvcWaH6I,"@Pat8pizza He knew exactly what was being asked, and he proved it with the coin one, but only after counting the number of quarters in each row. He knows what it means for a stick to be longer or shorter than another, and he&#39;s aware that if two sticks are lined up on a table together whichever one has an end extending past the end of the other must be longer. That&#39;s what he based his answer on, but he wasn&#39;t able to comprehend that a change in position or perspective had occurred, only that the ends he was looking at weren&#39;t lined up anymore. In his mind, the sticks were still lined up, so whichever stick extended past the end of the other must be longer. His answer was simply determined by which side he looked at."
gnArvcWaH6I,"Nah this is literally just Piaget&#39;s conservation tasks, its just that, its normal for a kid of that age."
gnArvcWaH6I,"@Yusran Sab I think I know what you mean. The kid obviously hasn’t developed the ability to determine that a quantity of something will stay the same despite adjustment. The play dough and the cracker tests are perfect ways of showing that. But with the coin, stick, and water glass tests, I’m not entirely sure the kid knew exactly what was being asked."
gnArvcWaH6I,"I wonder how the first task might be different if the researcher manipulated both rows of quarters, lengthening one and shortening the other, and asking the child to pick the one that would give them more money. I think the verbal aspect of these tasks creates a confound, potentially misleading the child or allowing for a semantic incongruence."
gnArvcWaH6I,"Here&#39;s a study <a href=""https://www.jstor.org/stable/1129812"">https://www.jstor.org/stable/1129812</a>"
gnArvcWaH6I,"However, the final task circumvents the potential linguistic confound by using &quot;fair.&quot; If the child indeed understood that despite having the same quantity, he still has less to eat, I don&#39;t see how he&#39;d be able to say that&#39;s fair if we are to assume his definition of fair is the same as ours. I could imagine a linguistic difference in the concept of more and less, but not so much with fair."
gnArvcWaH6I,"And just like toddlers, once they &quot;get&quot; the concept it seems so obvious in hindsight.<br><br>Development Psychology and Learning in general are absolutely fascinating"
gnArvcWaH6I,what
gnArvcWaH6I,They money is longer
gnArvcWaH6I,I also have a master&#39;s degree in clinical pediatry.
gnArvcWaH6I,Can’t fool an adult if they literally see you pour the same amount into a different container
gnArvcWaH6I,Not passive aggressive. Typical means that he doesn’t have any disabilities that affects his cognitive development. It helps to clarify that.
gnArvcWaH6I,r word probably
gnArvcWaH6I,"Thats kinda what theyre trying to show, this kid is still learning concepts like &quot;more/less&quot; and its normal for him to confuse them with other stuff like height or lenght. Children that age work better with than with absolutes"
gnArvcWaH6I,"@Kent, Knight of Caelin Yes."
gnArvcWaH6I,No.
gnArvcWaH6I,Pffft he even got the third one wrong
gnArvcWaH6I,I died
gnArvcWaH6I,Yeah how does she not realize that the guy is over complicating it cuz it’s way too easy😂
gnArvcWaH6I,😂😂
gnArvcWaH6I,HAHAHA!!🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂
gnArvcWaH6I,He is 4 what do u expect
gnArvcWaH6I,Why?
gnArvcWaH6I,Possibly
gnArvcWaH6I,"Which indicates he truly evaluted every single situation on their own. He could have figured &quot;Oh, she is showing me two of the same size all the time, so yea, they are the same by definition&quot;, but he didn&#39;t.<br>Reminded me of this kid: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TvDFFDKddEY"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TvDFFDKddEY</a>"
gnArvcWaH6I,My sister&#39;s a teacher and told me about this. I believe there is this magical crossover age (about grade 1-2) where kids are suddenly not fooled by these tricks any more.
gnArvcWaH6I,Gedrollt wird net
gnArvcWaH6I,I don&#39;t think u need to know the concept of volume to know that a stick won&#39;t change length by moving it
gnArvcWaH6I,Apparently not.
gnArvcWaH6I,I think our perception of boring is different in any situation that we aren&#39;t actually in. Any child not addicted to screen time would be fine with this unless they&#39;re very tired or otherwise out of sorts. I would imagine most adults would be shocked at how patient young kids are through school if they were to observe an average lesson now.
gnArvcWaH6I,Samee
gnArvcWaH6I,"nah, he&#39;s engaged in the task, getting one on one attention, in an environment tailored to less distractions, and is learning things. Kids are remarkably able to focus in the right settings."
gnArvcWaH6I,introverted kids be like
gnArvcWaH6I,"Why wouldn&#39;t he, if the kid doesn&#39;t do what you ask for they just don&#39;t know how to behave"
gnArvcWaH6I,I have a feeling they just told him &quot;wanna see some magic?&quot; That&#39;d be more than enough to get them engaged.
gnArvcWaH6I,Right 😂😂😂😂😂 where they do that at
gnArvcWaH6I,@Maverick Watch Reviews Well I can&#39;t say I libs but I don&#39;t think Conservatives are exactly the most factually oriented folks I&#39;ve met.

Put ur self at his age and u will see it the way he is seeing it . All children / toddlers have a way of seeing things differently its their way of working the problems out is so much more simple and w out getting all frustrated or overwhelmed . I say he did a bang up job and he problem solved all handled it better than any teenage today . See he didn&#39;t throw a fix or need mommy and daddy&#39;s help .
gnArvcWaH6I,NO HE DIDN&#39;T

If so you may be a bit full of yourself to have the audacity to say that Europeans are smarter while your spelling and grammar are both at a 4th grade level (American). But, I do agree that the whole world should use the metric system even if that has nothing to do with what you are arguing. Also I mention spelling because you&#39;ve already shown that you are willing to bring up petty arguments therefore I will do the same."

gnArvcWaH6I,"@Drained anyone who can’t maintain their own hygiene, prepare or even eat the foods they need to survive, or describe in words what they need (if their vocal cords and ears function) is not intelligent. I think intelligence starts to show at a later age and yes, kids are dumb especially compared to adults and other animal babies who have the instincts they need to survive, usually very early on in life. It’s not anyone’s fault, it’s precious and that’s why we have to care for our dumb kids, they need us every waking moment. they don’t have instincts or the intelligence required to survive. They don’t even have basic empathy which is why you see toddler pull a dogs tail, etc. that in the wild is VERY dangerous and dumb behavior. I don’t know how we made it this far."

gnArvcWaH6I,I was about to say how 1kg of feathers have more mass due to the buoyancy of air compared to their volume ( basically middle school physics) but damn... people here can not comprehend  how 1 kgs of one thing is equal to 1 kgs of another let alone the actual physics.

No matter wherever you measure them on this planet"
gnArvcWaH6I,"That kid is super fucking smart. His level of explanation is superior to most adults with whom I&#39;ve ever conversed. College professors can&#39;t even explain, with reason, the knowledge they claim to understand. Knowledge is knowing, understanding is explanation."

gnArvcWaH6I,"@S.A. Yeh I guess it depends what you mean by &quot;ignorance&quot;. If you include &quot;incomplete psychological development&quot; into that, then sure. But yeh, basically all kids go through this, and even some animals. It&#39;s an important development obviously."
gnArvcWaH6I,"@Les Paul Wouldn&#39;t that mean that the kid is ignorant? I don&#39;t mean to use the word as an insult, we all start out completely ignorant and through maturation gain more knowledge.<br><br>But yeah, I&#39;ve completely forgotten about the aspect if children&#39;s psychological development, I commented before I really thought about it.<br><br>- Cheers."

gnArvcWaH6I,"well yeah but not because they think it has more, well actually its just preference i think your just completely wrong"
gnArvcWaH6I,Nobody wants to drink beer out of a short glass.
gnArvcWaH6I,This is the point. Volume cannot be explained. It depends on the cognitive development of the child. Today this is his truth. Next year he will see it differently. This is what Piaget tells us.
gnArvcWaH6I,😂😂😂😂
gnArvcWaH6I,"@julestr520 Yes, the cups are all different size, but the actual amount of coffee is often the same, they are just filled up with more milk, foam or ice."
gnArvcWaH6I,@buschbohne001 are you talking about the cups? If so...a tall is much smaller than agrande🤔
gnArvcWaH6I,"@A H glasses are not marked for quantities, and you don&#39;t get to order a pint, but instead the glass is named something like &quot;brewtus&quot;. Which sounds massive but is about 0.6l. The trick is: it is as high as the 1 liter mug/jar."
gnArvcWaH6I,"This isn&#39;t true anymore, laws have changed and in most places in the US an establishment is required by law to inform the customer of the volume, because it was a common practice in the past. It is not required if refills are free though, since the customer is technically purchasing an &quot;unlimited&quot; volume, so if you regularly dine in at restaurants and drink refillable drinks you may not realize it."
gnArvcWaH6I,"@AUGSpeed whaaaaa?<br>So you&#39;re saying if I order a pint of beer in the US, and it comes in a pint glass, that I&#39;m not actually getting a pint?"
gnArvcWaH6I,And it&#39;s to prove to that people under a certain age think fundamentally this way

gnArvcWaH6I,“THE CAPITALIST STATE SAYS THATS FAIR! EAT THE RICH” -Toddler

gnArvcWaH6I,@Joelyfish42 this should be pinned for everyone to see
gnArvcWaH6I,He doesn&#39;t know if he&#39;s being tested or taught.
gnArvcWaH6I,"@This Yellow Face Yeah, she&#39;s giving him positive reinforcement when he answers incorrectly.  Once she said &quot;right&quot; and a few other times her tone could be interpreted that way."
gnArvcWaH6I,"@Joelyfish42 In this interview, it looks like it’s mostly evaluating what the kid is currently perceiving and how they understand size and scale. There won’t be any corrections made beyond just agreeing to acknowledge what the kid says, because it’s just collecting information. Beyond this interview, a teacher would review it, and think about what’s called inside/outside moves. This is where they might plan how to help a student think about a task, first by recognizing and telling the student what resources they are using to understand the problem (i.e I like that you are using your hands to measure the water level and make sure it is even) and then they’ll plan what  questions will help the student to evaluate their strategy and try a new technique (Talk to me about why you used your hands. What does it help you do? Could we try this way of measuring with other sized cups? Go back to the two differ at size cups and see how you can measure them.)<br><br>In an interview, it isn’t a normal class setting because there’s different expectations. One of the expectations is that the interviewer won’t tell you if you are right or wrong, just that they want to know how you’re thinking. The student is put as the expert. When the student returns to the classroom, then they’ll receive more instruction to help them approach a problem and use what they already know how to do"
gnArvcWaH6I,Interesting comment...I think that you may well be onto something!
gnArvcWaH6I,U just have no idea
gnArvcWaH6I,Yup very likely or his understanding of what was meant by &quot;more&quot; could be off.
gnArvcWaH6I,"To not make him feel like shit, they&#39;re not gonna remember this. That&#39;s why you don&#39;t try to teach toddlers academics, because they&#39;ll forget everything"
gnArvcWaH6I,@Ícaro Romano That&#39;s awesome! <br>De nada!
gnArvcWaH6I,"@João Pedro lol, yeah, I&#39;ll never see those &quot;based&quot; comments the same ever again, obrigado!"
gnArvcWaH6I,"I find kids at very young ages just take the world for what it is, including their own perceptions. He feels no need to remain silent because he doesn&#39;t understand why his answers would sound shameful or stupid to somebody with more context. He doesn&#39;t feel the need to simplify his answer because he has no reason not to believe the questions are asked in good faith. <br><br>He simply hasn&#39;t lived long enough to form the association, and is thus unhindered by any illusion of previous understanding of reality. That&#39;s one of the beautiful things about being a kid"
gnArvcWaH6I,"@João Pedro Better put, impossible"
gnArvcWaH6I,"@Seba Ramirez in short, this kid is based"
gnArvcWaH6I,Wtf u judt have no idea
gnArvcWaH6I,@Bruno Orel fr bruh
gnArvcWaH6I,A 3 year old dude
gnArvcWaH6I,@vOlympics ahh not developed yet. Now it makes sense. Thanks
gnArvcWaH6I,The brain doesnt understand the concept in this age
gnArvcWaH6I,Everyone was like that! U just have no idea
gnArvcWaH6I,Thats normal
gnArvcWaH6I,To this day he&#39;s still being scammed out of his fair share of graham crackers.
gnArvcWaH6I,Thats normal
gnArvcWaH6I,"Exactly. She did not define &#39;more&#39; so he tries to figure out what she means by her previous actions. She spreads them out, so they&#39;re &#39;more spread out&#39;. She moves it &#39;more&#39; to the right, so it&#39;s &#39;more longer to the right&#39;. Which is &quot;more bigger&quot;, does she mean taller? or wider? or flatter? Well, she flattened the playdough, so she must mean more flatter and wide."
gnArvcWaH6I,Yeah I think it is if I remember correctly<br>I studied Piaget long ago
gnArvcWaH6I,"@Agadir and 4four As someone who&#39;s currently studying Psychology, it&#39;s more about learning how the human&#39;s mind work, like mental health, cognitive thinking, or how the brain process information."
gnArvcWaH6I,"@Martian891 Just felt like it, whats the issue?"
gnArvcWaH6I,What? Why? What made you write this comment?
gnArvcWaH6I,Lol
gnArvcWaH6I,"Also took the bus by myself to the YMCA. At 7.. even though that&#39;s not 4.5..  I would state it was downtown in a large city, 40 minute bus ride. :)"

gnArvcWaH6I,no one cares
gnArvcWaH6I,Huh?
gnArvcWaH6I,"to be fair, fractions are a pretty difficult concept to pick up without decent maths education and even adults have a hard time with them"
gnArvcWaH6I,Bro what are these comments. This doesn&#39;t make any sense.
gnArvcWaH6I,"&quot;Yes, according to instructions... No, no dropping on hard surfaces... No, no submersions in water for prolonged periods... Yes, of course I already tried putting him to sleep and waking up again...&quot;"
gnArvcWaH6I,"Y&#39;all a bunch of psychopaths, just freaking share."
gnArvcWaH6I,@Jaime Cohen alright
gnArvcWaH6I,"@Manuel Not telling them the correct answer makes sense. In general, you don&#39;t want to bias the results mid-test by giving any information to the tester. Even though it might be a good learning opportunity :p"
gnArvcWaH6I,"I totally agree! Furthermore, why did she not tell the kid what the right answer was afterwards? Shouldnt he learn something from that?"
gnArvcWaH6I,You either inflate the value of money by not printing more or you inflate the value of stuff by printing more money. Either way the market will adjust accordingly based on how many people can / cannot afford stuff
gnArvcWaH6I,"@Travis Bickle whatever wage you have is your current maximum. And of course, zero is always the minimum wage."
gnArvcWaH6I,I think there should be no minimum wage. All wage should be maximum wage.
gnArvcWaH6I,@Danny DNA I mean I’d disagree considering wages aren’t the only thing that goes into deciding inflation.
gnArvcWaH6I,"@Giovanni Asaro that&#39;s not to be mean, that&#39;s how the brain works. The child&#39;s brain doesn&#39;t develop perception until hes around 4. It&#39;s just how it works, it&#39;s not mean at all"
gnArvcWaH6I,"@KakeAllDeWae hilarious. The amount of people nonsensically “whooshing” other people just to seem... I don’t know, something... is awesome."
gnArvcWaH6I,@Matthew Drysdale you know the guy you’re replying to is also OP
gnArvcWaH6I,"It&#39;s protege, nerd."
gnArvcWaH6I,@Major Spam If you actually think the joke in the comment was that they misspelled &quot;prodigy&quot; you might actually have the same level of intelligence as the kid in the video... unless you replied to the wrong person?
gnArvcWaH6I,@Gary Hamilton <br>The Joke<br>Your Head
gnArvcWaH6I,but sometimes concepts like that are just too hard for them to grasp <br>the cup water level is higher therefore it has more thats just about all they can process at that age
gnArvcWaH6I,I started primary school at that kids age. I find it hard to believe their are kids at that level starting school but I guess if you&#39;re below average and born at the wrong time of year then that&#39;s what happens
gnArvcWaH6I,You wouldnt have. Even if you are very intelligent
gnArvcWaH6I,SO UNDERRATED
gnArvcWaH6I,"@a day of a month of a year her moving the stick should not register to the child that it’s a new, longer stick. It’s the same object, just being moved. That’s how I was taught the definition or permanence 🤷🏼‍♀️"
gnArvcWaH6I,Is that what object permeance means? I thought it mean when an object is completely out of sign a child recognises it still exists..? Is there another form of this or?
gnArvcWaH6I,@BrosBrothersLP how so?
gnArvcWaH6I,No that is not what this is about. He knows what more means. He just doenst understand why we apply it differently to different things
gnArvcWaH6I,"Oh, yes! When I was little, my brother once told me that blowing on a damp bottom of a cooking pot would cause the pot to explode. I am - to this day - afraid of damp cooking pot bottoms. I turn 31 next week :D"
gnArvcWaH6I,agree completely<br>while its true this child is only four years old.<br>telling lies because<br>-kids wouldn&#39;t get it.<br>will backfire at some point
gnArvcWaH6I,"An early child psychology experiment, NOT to make him feel bad...something about conservation of matter"

gnArvcWaH6I,Hes an scp thats it!
gnArvcWaH6I,My thoughts exactly
gnArvcWaH6I,"Why? It wouldn&#39;t help: she would had spend far to many time to explain it in vain, the only think it would make would be making him being frustrated. Just let him grow up a little bit and then his brain will be able to comprehend it by himself."
gnArvcWaH6I,This is why typical children aren&#39;t allowed to be cashiers.
gnArvcWaH6I,🤣🤣🤣🤣
gnArvcWaH6I,😆
gnArvcWaH6I,I rolfoled . Imagined with serious face.
gnArvcWaH6I,Made me laugh more than it should!
gnArvcWaH6I,@Our travelingzoo I am a non native english speaker living in my country of origin. 😂
gnArvcWaH6I,Smashed plus squished
gnArvcWaH6I,Seriously? I’m 55 and have used it for decades
gnArvcWaH6I,This is the thing: their brain is not mature enough to understand the difference between those concept. The purpose on Piaget experiment is not to test a kid intelligence but to learn how they think a each age.
gnArvcWaH6I,"Piaget experiment doesn&#39;t have the purpose to teach or to correct kids. It&#39;s to know how kids think at each age in order to then teach them properly at school. His brain is not mature enough to comprehend the difference between longer, more, taller or between older and taller. So, school teachers learn thanks to those experiment how they pupils see the world and understand it. Teaching him he was wrong at this age wouldn&#39;t be efficient because his brain is simply not able to understand. Later, he will see the differences by himself."
gnArvcWaH6I,how is this video still active when it was posted in 2011?
gnArvcWaH6I,"@GeorgianaDarcy That&#39;s really cool! I never thought of it that way. Thank you for that thorough explanation, I really appreciate that!  :)"
gnArvcWaH6I,"Piaget experiments where made to understand how children&#39;s brain works at each age in order to then developed a good way to teach them at school.Don&#39;t worry it won&#39;t do anything wrong to that kid. This experiment prove that his brain is not mature enough to comprehend the differences between the concept of &quot;more&quot; and &quot;bigger&quot; or between &quot;older&quot; and &quot;taller&quot;. Take a 6 years old child and you&#39;ll see the difference :)  This one is not stupid or he doesn&#39;t have a lack of vocabulary knowledge. He just answered the normal way for a kid of his age. Thanks to those experiments, teachers around the world knows what are the limit their pupils brain have and how to teach them the bases so when they&#39;ll be mature enough they could understand those concept by them self and not just know it because they where told it&#39;s that way."
gnArvcWaH6I,"And this would be ok if you are about 6 and older. This is an experiment to understand how a 4 years old kids &#39;s brain  work. He is not dumb, his brain is simply not mature enough to understand those concept. Your parents would maybe tell you the difference, but it&#39;s not the same than learning it&#39;s different, than completly understand why."
gnArvcWaH6I,@midillet23 he/she did this to other children around the same age no need to be rude...
gnArvcWaH6I,"&quot;It&#39;s spread out, so it&#39;s more&quot; lol"

gnArvcWaH6I,😅
gnArvcWaH6I,"I used to feed my little brother when he was a baby. When he didn&#39;t want to eat, all it took to make him eat was : &quot;Do you want to eat this?&quot; &quot;No.&quot; &quot;No?&quot; &quot;No.&quot; &quot;No?&quot; &quot;No.&quot; &quot;Yes?&quot; &quot;No.&quot; Yes?&quot; &quot;No&quot; &quot;Yes?&quot; &quot;Yes?&quot; &quot;Yes&quot; &quot;Yes&quot; and then he would eat.<br>I have no idea why it worked, but it worked every time."
gnArvcWaH6I,"Don’t think you’re special kid, I was able to to count to ten by the time I was only ten plus ten."
gnArvcWaH6I,"He did nothing wrong. Why you need to tell him? The whole point of the experiment is that this is how we see  the world &quot;naturally&quot;.  We fall on the same &quot;wrongs&quot; everyday, the whole commercial packaging theory revolves on that. Why there aren&#39;t short and wide bottles of anything anymore? All bottles are tall because seems like there&#39;s more liquid on it."
gnArvcWaH6I,@Matei Anghel education in America isn&#39;t great because we don&#39;t fund it but that&#39;s not the fault of educational research

gnArvcWaH6I,Study 1 chapter of educational psychology and you will understand
gnArvcWaH6I,"They probably did this study with dozens of other kids, so in a scientific way, this isolated kid&#39;s performance isnt of any particular interest to the examinators, neither is the fact that he is getting all the tasks wrong. They actually dont tell him the right answer so that it doesnt affect his natural behavior and reasoning for his following answers (which are expected from a child of his age)"
gnArvcWaH6I,@delta Mico exactly

gnArvcWaH6I,Kids don&#39;t understand conservation of matter - that amounts don&#39;t change even if their form has changed. He won&#39;t fully get it until age 11 or so most likely
gnArvcWaH6I,"@Alexandra Grisel Tello Valenzuela quickly telling someone to &quot;google psychology&quot; without providing any reasoning of your own is probably not smart when the person you&#39;re responding to shared 3 detailed paragraphs in a language you&#39;re still learning<br>sirpancherto&#39;s comment, even if you disagree with it, at least provides a lot of reasoning to promote discussion. you&#39;re just shutting down discussion, without considering that maybe you don&#39;t even understand what they&#39;re saying"
gnArvcWaH6I,"@sirpancherto Yes, generalizing could be absurd sometimes but in this case, it is not. Psychologists&#39; theories exist as a guide of human&#39;s behavior, I mean, there could exist exceptions. I invite you to google more about Psychology and why it is a science."
gnArvcWaH6I,"No, I strongly believe It&#39;s beacuse that both adults and kids don&#39;t process information in the same way. If you are interested in this topic, you should google Piaget&#39;s theory, you are going to be amazed, It&#39;s really interesting.(Sorry for my grammar mistakes, I&#39;m still learning English) Have a nice day"
gnArvcWaH6I,"It&#39;s incredibly obvious that the boy is just trying to say whatever answer she as an authority figure wants/expects to hear. It looks similar to when people thought certain horses could count objects when asked, while the horses were simply tapping their hooves until the asker appeared satisfied at the correct number. <br><br>Psychology is a science, but it&#39;s one with an exceptionally high rate of errors up through the present day (i.e. the reproducibility crisis). Common sense should not be ignored simply because some college students or professors conducted a number of poorly-thought-out experiments. And no, circular reasoning--&quot;this result is valid because these other identical results were valid [because they were replicated the same way as this]!&quot;--isn&#39;t the answer either, despite the many commenters trying to apply it here.<br><br>Also, generalizing from these few kids to &quot;all human children at ages X-Y&quot; to say that it&#39;s <b>impossible</b> for them to grasp certain concepts is patently absurd. My godson easily passed the volume and quantity tests when he was 4, yet I promise you he&#39;s not some superhuman prodigy for it, lol."
gnArvcWaH6I,@Clay Menefee <b>this</b>
gnArvcWaH6I,"@abbreviatedalex of course he can, that&#39;s the difference between bright and average kids, how much stimulus  they receive"
gnArvcWaH6I,"That&#39;s not the point of this exercise. You&#39;re just going to frustrate him (and render your data worthless) if you derail the study to try to convince him that he&#39;s wrong. He&#39;s wrong because his brain hasn&#39;t developed yet. He&#39;ll pick it up naturally in time, but he literally cannot understand it right now."
gnArvcWaH6I,"@Vaidas Šukaukas In many many other social science experiments it&#39;s vital to ask whether the participant fully understands the language that is being used. I feel confident that this one has been repeated so many times that we know it&#39;s cognitive rather than language , but initially I&#39;m sure they worked hard to figure out whether it was a language issue."
gnArvcWaH6I,"What&#39;s up with people claiming the kid does not know the meaning of more? He seemed fine comprehending what else she was saying. Besides, do you honestly believe they, children, don&#39;t have trouble understanding conservation? And how can you do it over two days when the whole thing is about change from one state to another? If you do it over two days, the kid won&#39;t remember the initial state."
gnArvcWaH6I,"They lack conservation (the psychological term). It’s a logical thinking ability that allows a person to determine that a certain quantity will remain the same despite adjustment of the container, shape, or apparent size, according to the psychologist Jean Piaget. So, you were close!!"

I didn&#39;t &quot;like&quot; the comment, but I still understood it. You can correct the grammar but there&#39;s really no reason to be unreasonably butthurt. You also have to realize people make these posts quite literally just to get likes and feel good about themselves. There&#39;s really nothing wrong with that. Tbh I just came back to this comment and realized I didn&#39;t really find it funny but I thought it was fine. Also it doesn&#39;t mean they are uneducated. Even smart people have simple minds at times. You could also view it as you being quite illogical to try to right something that is so trivial and is only wrong in certain perspectives."
gnArvcWaH6I,"@obliterator154 2.7k found it funny, out of over 7 MILLION views.   whats the percentage on that one?  theres a funny joke in there somewhere, if you think that comment has clout"

gnArvcWaH6I,@susanna rita might be the Canadian one dollar &amp; two dollar coin? The two dollar coin (toonie) is silver with gold in the middle and the one dollar coin (loonie) is gold. There’s a lot of countries that use dollars though so might be others I don’t know of. Are you Australian by chance?
gnArvcWaH6I,"@ribbonsofnight honestly before I wrote the reply I stopped to think if there was a currency called dollar that has coins that match the silver/gold thing they&#39;re talking about and couldn&#39;t think of one and so decided to be facetious, assuming that they&#39;d done what you&#39;re talking about (especially since I explicitly referred to size in my original comment). Fair criticism though, I probably shouldn&#39;t jump to the bad faith interpretation. I am genuinely curious of which &#39;dollar&#39; has coins like that"
gnArvcWaH6I,@susanna rita I&#39;m interested that you both assume you know what coins the other is referring to. I guess you&#39;re in that developmental stage where you can&#39;t imagine there&#39;s a country outside your own.
gnArvcWaH6I,"@Fill Gollins der großartiche Meddler nope, they&#39;re both gold. $2 coin is slightly thicker but with a shorter diameter than the $1"
gnArvcWaH6I,that&#39;s different. you thought the material was silver and equals the value of the coin.
gnArvcWaH6I,Omg 🤣
gnArvcWaH6I,"Fun fact: given how young the universe is, it is way more likely that we&#39;ll be the super advanced alien visitors. And due to how much conflict there was, and will be, throughout our history... Even if an even older race comes with intentions of conquest or genocide, we will most likely have total superiority when it comes to military technology. Humans are really underrated as far as space age civilisations go"
gnArvcWaH6I,"I also say most children because there is the rare occasion when a child can perceive quantity and would understand that in all of the examples they are the same size. The graham cracker thing at the end is simple the child seeing two i front of the teacher and one in front of him, he sees the quantity (since he probably understand adults eat more than him) and sees he only has one and she has two so it’s not fair."
gnArvcWaH6I,"This is normal for most children, it might not seem like it but you were probably the same way as a child. They perceive quantity similarly to the way dogs do, if it looks like more/is bigger it is more/bigger and if it looks like less/is smaller it is less/smaller. Like the playdough, the two balls were the same but when she smooshed it it looked smaller, so to children/dogs it would be less  and the same exact amount just in ball form would be bigger. The water is an even better example of it, I’m sure you can see why."
gnArvcWaH6I,@Ryan Houser ya I understand that but she didn’t correct him on it. She corrected him on the first one that he got wrong but not this one. So that made me think that maybe he got it right 😂 <br><br>I thought I was going stupid there for a second haha
gnArvcWaH6I,No he just thinks because it’s more to the right it looks bigger 🤣🤣
gnArvcWaH6I,"I think the exercise was to show people how kids think, not to torment them. It’s also a good psychological study for psychologists to better understand the developing mind, as an aspiring psychologist myself I can tell you there isn’t really much to go off of. We have stages and we have theories but nothings set in stone."
gnArvcWaH6I,"Agreed. <br><br>Around his age, they lack conservation (the psychological term). It’s a logical thinking ability that allows a person to determine that a certain quantity will remain the same despite adjustment of the container, shape, or apparent size, according to the psychologist Jean Piaget.<br><br>Jena Piaget is our hero!"

gnArvcWaH6I,"After thorough review of the literature, the court has realized that these studies may have left many important confounding variables out of the picture, and this basic concept in psychology may be completely false! The precedents that have been set will be thoroughly  reviewed and most likely overturned."

gnArvcWaH6I,"Except I don’t like when she says, “right” after he says something that really is wrong. A lot of us say that word in conversation when we don’t mean it but I expect it causes some real problems sometimes. And here it would positively reinforce a wrong assumption in this child."

gnArvcWaH6I,If it&#39;s something they like they would realize real quick how unfair it is. Kids always complain when someone has a bigger peice then them if they have to share something. This kid was just trying to give the right answer the lady was looking for. She kept saying great at the end of his responses so he thought he was getting them right and continued to answer that way I&#39;m sure.

gnArvcWaH6I,@seife41 you are right... I was using him as a template... he may as well develop to be a decent person
gnArvcWaH6I,"The child may memorize the answers, but he/she won&#39;t actually understand. This kind of thing is easy to see through"
gnArvcWaH6I,True man

gnArvcWaH6I,He is enstine
gnArvcWaH6I,Bla bla bla
gnArvcWaH6I,Ur righ t
gnArvcWaH6I,"Exactly my thoughts. I mean it&#39;s clear that when she asked the question about the play-do (after squishing it) &quot;does this one have more playdo, or are they the same?&quot; How is a kid going to interpret the question &quot;are they the same&quot; to mean &quot;the same quantity&quot;? In their heads, it&#39;s clearly not the same looking.."
gnArvcWaH6I,"Yep, me too.  I got called out of class and asked weird &quot;grown up&quot; questions like what season it was and what month it was."
gnArvcWaH6I,Large cups cost the same so I don’t know why they would
gnArvcWaH6I,exactly
gnArvcWaH6I,there&#39;s actually a much deeper conclusion you can take from this that&#39;s pretty interesting
gnArvcWaH6I,I was definitely not that fucking dumb
gnArvcWaH6I,What a rube!
gnArvcWaH6I,"Its a psychology study demonstrating how we perceive reality in different phases of our minds development. Educate yourself before you comment, stop intoxicating the community with your ignorance"
gnArvcWaH6I,Him: &quot;You son of a b&quot;
gnArvcWaH6I,"I think the focus is that something changed.  To a kid, if it changed then the old answer isn&#39;t right no matter what that old answer was.  The kid isn&#39;t stupid, he just hasn&#39;t developed yet.  Critical thinking kicks in with a little more independence."
gnArvcWaH6I,And now you&#39;ve let the secret out thousands of soda companies are gonna go bust
gnArvcWaH6I,And now you&#39;ve let the secret out thousands of soda companies are gonna go bust

gnArvcWaH6I,"@edicius Hawthorne rarely is the question asked, is our children learning"
gnArvcWaH6I,@RetroCheats ok
gnArvcWaH6I,@BTTStratosphere they understand the word no though
gnArvcWaH6I,"They&#39;re brains cant comprehend it, it would be pointless"
gnArvcWaH6I,"Just because it’s what people want to hear doesn’t make it true. It’s not the correct answer. In what world would you be ok with this? You doctor screens you, finds out you have cancer but says you don’t because that’s what you want to hear doesn’t take away from the fact that you have cancer."
gnArvcWaH6I,That is the blind spot of many psychological experiments. Language being constructed and negotiable.
gnArvcWaH6I,I know the simple answer is &quot;because child&quot; but was wondering if there&#39;s a more specific explation. Like whicg part of the brain is undeveloped yet
gnArvcWaH6I,Kids don&#39;t think the same way adults do lol
gnArvcWaH6I,Aww. That&#39;s so cute.
gnArvcWaH6I,"@OK Yeah, it&#39;s so funny and strange. It&#39;s almost like there&#39;s a ton of factors that can create a rich or poor country that civilians can&#39;t change, who would have thought?"
gnArvcWaH6I,"@OK main reason why Asians are considered smarter is for a number of reasons but I&#39;d say number one being that for Asian families in general (South and East Asian at least), education has been the most important objective for parents of this origin and consequently, at a younger age, these kids are exposed to more work and develop a stronger work ethic than non Asians (I&#39;m talking generally, not for every case). This is moreso for Asians living in western countries (as in my case). In my personal experience, Asians are also more likely to have private tuition which also enhances this. So it&#39;s not really down to because they&#39;re Asian but really how parents treat their child&#39;s education at a young age. Also if parents are educated then their kids are likely to be too because they will learn more complex words and have a richer vocabulary, be around books growing up etc.<br><br>This is just a personal observation, I don&#39;t know if you guys know any Sri Lankan Tamil people but these guys are so good at maths, it&#39;s not even funny. I think this is down to their language which is ridiculously complex and highly logical and shares traits with maths"
gnArvcWaH6I,Maybe he meant it in a stereotypical context. Like how there are so many „5 year old chinese violin prodigies“ ? I doubt he meant it in an ethnical sense (that would be too dumb for anyone)
gnArvcWaH6I,I think they do stuff like this to test for normal childhood development and to understand like how our understanding of the world happens
gnArvcWaH6I,Lmao
gnArvcWaH6I,"Exactly! I think 99% of the time he was trying to give her the answer he thought she wanted. It shows it in the graham cracker example when he says him getting one and her getting two was fair. Obviously he knew it wasn’t, but he was just saying it was because he thought that’s what she wanted to hear."
gnArvcWaH6I,"It’s just an experiment to tell them what they already want to hear, that children can’t distinguish between amounts. A shame they couldn’t do it in an actually useful way."

gnArvcWaH6I,@T&#39;was an old username and I&#39;ll change it soon. the meaning of words change overtime
gnArvcWaH6I,@AndrewLemonaki  I know it&#39;s a different idea from the one common people are used to when they say &quot;food chain&quot;... but it&#39;s the actual idea of what food chain means.
gnArvcWaH6I,@AndrewLemonaki  That&#39;s basically my point. Food chain is all about trophic levels. So it&#39;d be about what a human&#39;s diet is. Not about whether or not they can kill things.
gnArvcWaH6I,"@T&#39;was an old username and I&#39;ll change it soon. who would win in a fight with no rules: a lion, or a human? (which is most likely using a gun)"

gnArvcWaH6I,we get dumber as we age😂
gnArvcWaH6I,"You&#39;d think people would know, yet people are still asking what&#39;s going on."
gnArvcWaH6I,"Well, first it&#39;s helpful to know that what we understand about mathematical logic isn&#39;t something to be taken for granted. <br><br>That kind of thing just isn&#39;t inherent in human beings. It&#39;s learned.<br><br>And yes, we&#39;re more primitive than you would think. And in some sense, the perception that we&#39;re unique intellectual creatures is an illusion. We&#39;re not robots at the end of the day."
gnArvcWaH6I,how tf are we on the top of the food chain
gnArvcWaH6I,I agree. And the fact that so many of us watching this thinks this kid could&#39;ve known otherwise means that we take our knowledge for granted.
gnArvcWaH6I,"Yeah. One of the most important people in the field of psych, bio, and child development. His work is heavily recommended."
gnArvcWaH6I,A pound of feathers weighs more because you have to carry the weight of what you did to those birds.
gnArvcWaH6I,@littlegerman12 well bricks are heavier than feathers so a pound of bricks will always be heavier
gnArvcWaH6I,@RB the guy asked for weight. What u are saying is mass. Two different things. Saying someone weighs 50 kg is wrong. In reality they weigh 50N and their mass is around 5 kg kek
gnArvcWaH6I,"@Sam Leicht I am glad you&#39;re interested in physics, though I have to say that ”what weighs more” doesn&#39;t mean the pounds they mentioned are a unit of force, quite contrary in this example I&#39;d say.<br><br>Also look up Wikipedia ”Weight” page for different meanings of the word, one is the resultant force."
gnArvcWaH6I,"I’m pretty sure there are three different forces here. First is the weight which is mass times gravitational acceleration, and if you have one pound of feathers and one pound of bricks, their weight is the same. Second is the buoyant force which will make the pound of feathers feel lighter, however that does not change their weight. The third force is the net force which you all are confusing with weight. The net force combines both the weight and the buoyant force. The net force of the feathers is less than the net force of the bricks. Since the questions asks which pile weighs more, the buoyant force and net force have nothing to do with the answer. The two piles weigh the same."
gnArvcWaH6I,🤣🤣🤣
gnArvcWaH6I,Lmao your not the only one
gnArvcWaH6I,When I was a kid starting school we had to do a test to assess our capalities. I still remember my answer to the question how many teeth does a chicken have. My answer was two.
gnArvcWaH6I,I think a lot of adults would have messed up the one where blue water was poured into a taller glass... ;)
gnArvcWaH6I,"Broh, me too but we don&#39;t say that out loud 😆"
gnArvcWaH6I,"I doubt we&#39;ve stopped. But the truth is that 99.99% of new studies conducted bring absolutely no new information, as any credible doctor would tell you. <br><br>There was an incredible podcast with Dr. Peter Attia on the Joe Rogan podcast who said just that, which kind of blew my mind at the time.<br><br>If there is any information you would like to know, chances are you&#39;ll learn quicker and more through reading the literature on it rather than conducting a study yourself.<br><br>The information we have is so abundant to the point where new studies have severe difficulty budging the current knowledge."
gnArvcWaH6I,Ikr. lol
gnArvcWaH6I,It&#39;s not a comprehensive notion to think that &quot;the government&quot; is simply an evil entity. <br><br>The government also falls prey to the same tactics by corporations.<br>e.g. tax evasion
gnArvcWaH6I,"Well, he is smaller. lol"
gnArvcWaH6I,"Technically you&#39;re paying less if the grams to cost ratio is more cost effective. <br><br>And the bigger packages tend to be. Not aways, but most of the time. Generally it&#39;s also written there on the price though so you don&#39;t have to calculate it yourself."
gnArvcWaH6I,This is clearly a test for psychology. lmao
gnArvcWaH6I,"@Djiby Top I see what you&#39;re saying, and yes I agree with that.  That&#39;s exactly why this is a theory.  If someone&#39;s trying to use this as proof that this theory is fact then they are automatically wrong.  I think you would agree, am I wrong?"
gnArvcWaH6I,"@DarkDeWolf yes it was a short answer for a complex issue. <br><br>The basic idea is that you always have to acknowledge the limitations of your experimental design, and if its flaws prevent you from drawing solid conclusions.<br><br>Of course this does not mean that you should give up. Just that you have to admit it when your experiment suggests rather than proving something.<br><br>E.g. &quot;the results are consistent with the hypothesis that [...] but they do not provide conclusive evidence. Future studies can [...]"
gnArvcWaH6I,"@Djiby Top That would have to depend on the number of variables that were being altered.  As stated previously, no experiment is perfect. Scientists don&#39;t just give up if an experiment isn&#39;t perfect.  There is a point where what you&#39;ve said is true, but there&#39;s a threshold to be crossed which I would assume is usually different for each person.  So, well you&#39;re technically correct in a way, when you say &quot;cannot do any better&quot; you aren&#39;t referring to anything there. You haven&#39;t given a threshold which as I&#39;ve said most likely changes with each person. If you can give me evidence of this threshold having an exact definition or way to tell when you&#39;ve hit it, let me know."
gnArvcWaH6I,"@BrosBrothersLP fair enough. As long as the claim is not that this specific video is proof of anything. I myself find it interesting putting all the methodological controversies aside.<br><br>Unfortunately netting out interviewer effects is notoriously difficult even in much more neutral settings (take the Hawthorne experiments, where simple observation was enough to bias the results)."
gnArvcWaH6I,"@Djiby Top this video might not be the perfect conduction of this experiment. The real studys obviously look different. This is just a demonstration of the concepts you test. <br>Also when people say she is enforcing &quot;wrong&quot; answers or suggesting them it is important to know that these social and speech cues for expected answers are also learned behaviour that are not present in a (every) toddler. <br><br>I dont know if you raised this point (i dont think so) but a lot of people are suggesting that she should correct him for giving wrong answeres to see his improvement. This is not the intend of this, also if you correct a toddler in this situation where they already feel under pressure they will become annoyed and stop Participating.<br><br>I guess in this video the postive reactions of the Interviewer is artificially hightened to make sure that the videotaping and answers stay brief."
gnArvcWaH6I,Agree.  He&#39;s just lacking experience.
gnArvcWaH6I,😂😂😂😂😂👌👌
gnArvcWaH6I,This is literally all children its not showing that this one is dumb its showing how most kids react to this test.

gnArvcWaH6I,@Nightmarex how do you know?

Want to stay young? Stay open-minded."

gnArvcWaH6I,@Julia Maria thats what they want u to think
gnArvcWaH6I,@James M Absolutely I agree but to then go on and suggest what those things are shows arrogance beyond what words are capable of describing.
gnArvcWaH6I,"@J D you don&#39;t need to be a psychologist to see possible sources of error in an experiment. The adult performing the experiment could absolutely have had a hand in its results, intentionally or otherwise."
gnArvcWaH6I,"All kids go through this phase though, it&#39;s a very well documented step in children&#39;s psychological development"
gnArvcWaH6I,"As Les Paul already said, it is completely normal behavior for a child this age. Do your own research and get your facts right before you comment such nonsense."
gnArvcWaH6I,"Literally every kid in the world goes through this phase. You would know that if you took a single Psychology 101 class. Object permanence is not an innate ability, and is learned at different ages for different children. It is a well understood and documented psychological phenomenon, one which you and I have also been through."
gnArvcWaH6I,The truth is...there is no spoon.
gnArvcWaH6I,"@Michael Devenish &quot;the point of the test is to find whether or not a child thinks  something has physically changed in shape/size when moved or stretched in some way.&quot; &quot;the point of the test to is to evaluate whether a child can deduce that a property is conserved regardless of anything else. &quot; Yes, sure, thats a good way of putting it. So when something is changed, like the quarters are moved apart, and the child is asked if one has more quarters, the fact that the question is the same as before leads them to believe that the answer is must have changed as well. They forget what the question actually is asking, because they potentially think that an adult would not ask the same thing twice with nothing being changed. It is likely that he doesn&#39;t say that the second row has more quarters because he thinks that, but he will say it because when you&#39;re trying to get an answer right, it does not make sense to answer the same thing again when something has clearly changed. The test needs to be conducted more clearly, with a focus on asking the child what has changed, instead of basically asking them whether something has changed."
gnArvcWaH6I,"This has been done 7273738 times in different ways, it has nothing to do with how this child thinks or how this person carried the test, it&#39;s literally how children&#39;s brains work at this age"
gnArvcWaH6I,Yea I was about to say. I get the principle they&#39;re trying to demonstrate here but it&#39;s honestly a lot of &#39;im giving you the answer I think you want for social approval&#39;.
gnArvcWaH6I,Like politicians
gnArvcWaH6I,"@Michael Devenish I think you fail to see the social aspect of the test. It&#39;s between two living people. Some kids act differently with adults, especially strangers. Some kids are shy and easily think being weird or sounding silly is bad or humiliating. The test is not only about the ability to think, but also the ability to interact socially with the test maker."
gnArvcWaH6I,"The point of this is to show the concept of object permanence, which develops in early childhood. &quot;Giving them the answer&quot; is useless, since they do not yet have the cognitive understanding of object permanence."
gnArvcWaH6I,@Les Paul very interesting. Well thank you for enlightening me
gnArvcWaH6I,"@Perry Plays It is a &quot;test&quot; of sorts, to determine if children have acquired object permanence. These exercises were made up by Piaget, a Swiss psychologist, in order to determine stages in children&#39;s psychological development."
gnArvcWaH6I,@Les Paul interesting. So what is the point of the exercise? To simply encourage conversation?
gnArvcWaH6I,"Because it is useless. What this video shows is the concept of object permanence, which all humans develop at a certain age in childhood. They will not &quot;understand the logic&quot; until they naturally reach the phase of object permanence. Correcting them would not do anything"
gnArvcWaH6I,i&#39;m glad i saw this...i was researching a job candidate and discovered he is a grown up version of this kid--gonna be a hard pass

gnArvcWaH6I,There&#39;s an Abbott and Costello bit that is very similar to this. <br><br>Look up &quot;Two 10s for a 5&quot;
gnArvcWaH6I,"Because there’s no need to, and it’s basically pointless as it is completely normal behavior and they’ll eventually outgrow it."
gnArvcWaH6I,Yep. It makes him think that there has to be a difference so his answer must change.
gnArvcWaH6I,Thank you!
gnArvcWaH6I,This is completely normal behavior for a child this age. Do your research before commenting next time.
gnArvcWaH6I,no
gnArvcWaH6I,Dude why do you have to bring politics into this? Especially involving a child? That&#39;s pretty fked.

gnArvcWaH6I,He doesn&#39;t have a great future anywhere with his IQ.
gnArvcWaH6I,"I fucking know, right!?"
gnArvcWaH6I,I will see this.
gnArvcWaH6I,"Yeah, he cearly doesn&#39;t have a future in any brain activities."
gnArvcWaH6I,"No, just this one."
gnArvcWaH6I,Yep.
gnArvcWaH6I,Yes. I honestly can&#39;t believe that this isn&#39;t staged. I refuse to think that people like this exist. The stick gets longer if the girl moves it to the left? Pfft yeah okay no one is going to think that. 100% staged for views.
gnArvcWaH6I,"No need to be disrespectful. I&#39;m a Democrat too, but I recognize that we are all good people. The other parties are not our enemies, but simply friends with who we disagree on mutual issues."
gnArvcWaH6I,I agree
gnArvcWaH6I,"@Raymond Kertezc Actually we can already notice shortcomings in our thinking, by comparing ourselves with AI. consider games like Chess or GO where AI have gotten so good where it make moves that seem completely nonsensical even to experts before the AI&#39;s plan is revealed. Same with design of construction where AI can design structures that are more efficient and structurally sound while using less materials than what professional architects can do. I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll end up with AIs designing/controlling basically every facet of our civilization and we&#39;ll all stand there looking at it, shrug our shoulders and say &quot;Well I don&#39;t know what it&#39;s doing, but things are going great... I think.&quot;"
gnArvcWaH6I,this. <br><br>there could quite well be shortcomings in our thinking we just aren&#39;t capable of noticing
gnArvcWaH6I,"I have been reading this thread for 10 minutes.  Miles, YOU win the Best In Thread award.  Well done!"
gnArvcWaH6I,How is your future going?
gnArvcWaH6I,Also it&#39;s fascinating to hear his explanations for his answers and to see him not doubt them for a second
gnArvcWaH6I,It&#39;s an experiment idk what it was for but probably to learn about children&#39;s thinking or something not show everyone how dumb they are
gnArvcWaH6I,Bruh😂😂😂😂
gnArvcWaH6I,<i>________________</i> ===&gt; the learning curve of the Kid
gnArvcWaH6I,"Honestly, he figured it out REALLY quickly after reasoning it out. He was just using a different logic for his justification, then realized it doesn&#39;t always apply"
gnArvcWaH6I,"Nope. He probably understands his language extremely well. It&#39;s just his brain hasn&#39;t quite developed enough to do the abstract thinking required to answer these questions correctly.<br><br>This is a test created by Paiget, a psychologist, to prove one of his stages of development. Paiget came up a system for human development, in which developed occurs in stages. This kid is in the concrete operational stage, like all of us were at his age. This means that kids can really only understand thier world based on what they see. This is why toddlers think you dissappear when you play peek-a-boo."
gnArvcWaH6I,@PointsofData i knew someone would take my joke too seriously yet i made it anyway
gnArvcWaH6I,Dude what? It&#39;s a classic kids psychology thing. They haven&#39;t learned critical thinking skills.
gnArvcWaH6I,"@Jim Greene Exactly, it&#39;s probably he just doesn&#39;t understand what &quot;longer&quot; means hahha"
gnArvcWaH6I,"I know little kids aren&#39;t great with measurements like this, but I ask myself how much of this is just him not understanding the language."
gnArvcWaH6I,that&#39;s what <i>she</i> said!
gnArvcWaH6I,T H E S A M E
gnArvcWaH6I,"Ssshhh, its the same!"
gnArvcWaH6I,@drummerjacob restaurants often use smaller than normal plates so that when you compare the amount of food to the plate subconsciously you will think “wow this is a nice portion size!” The same thing will happen vice versa. Even if you say made sauce for sphagetti and had some leftover that you needed to put in a container. If you used a wide pan to make the sauce like an iron skillet then you will think you have less sauce compared to if you used a smaller pan or used a pot.
gnArvcWaH6I,@DrummerJacob I mean they often use the smallest plate possible.
gnArvcWaH6I,Yes
gnArvcWaH6I,@Katie Eddlemon he doesn’t understand the question
gnArvcWaH6I,"Nah. He just isn&#39;t quite developed enough to process the changes in front of him as being equal. It&#39;s all explained in Paiget&#39;s stages of development. This kid is in his concrete operational stage, meaning he can only perceive his world as he observes it. He just can&#39;t think abstractly yet."
gnArvcWaH6I,because it&#39;s dyed
gnArvcWaH6I,"As a kid I remember this study <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnArvcWaH6I&amp;t=1m57s"">1:57</a> being done on me and even after she poured the water into a different container I knew both cups held the same amount of liquid but for whatever reason I told her the taller cup had more."
gnArvcWaH6I,At least some people understand 🙏
gnArvcWaH6I,"I know right! Like, sure the kid may not fuller understand every word in the language, but it&#39;s not the reason why the kid is getting these tests wrong.<br><br>I&#39;m sure most of these people here haven&#39;t taken a psych course, or don&#39;t remember the chapter on Piaget and the theories of development. The kid is still in his concrete operational phase. He simply does not have the capacity yet to figure out that each of these things are the same!"
gnArvcWaH6I,@joe 😆😅😆hope not.
gnArvcWaH6I,"@sakthi sd it&#39;s not just the surgery, some places are allowing hormone blockers to children w/o parents&#39; consent."
gnArvcWaH6I,No one&#39;s getting a surgery before 18
gnArvcWaH6I,But if you move the stick to the left/his right... this implies there is something consistent in the kids view of mass and matter and doesn&#39;t work with your argument. Similarly... even adults if forced to make a snap decision will answer like the kid does with quarters.<br>There is a lot more going on here then you&#39;d notice at a quick glance.
gnArvcWaH6I,"SMouse Booth its because of language barriers he obviously doesnt think that stick magically grew longer, he just doesnt know the difference between “more”, “bigger”, “longer”, “ahead”, etc."
gnArvcWaH6I,@yellowmarkers I&#39;m not so sure. He was able to explain his reasoning pretty well which means he has a good grasp on speech. If he had not been able to explain himself I would say it was a language issue.
gnArvcWaH6I,"@Talea I&#39;m pretty sure he is misunderstanding definitions and not misunderstanding reality. I don&#39;t think he thought that the stick magically grew longer or that the amount of playdoh magically increased, I think he just doesn&#39;t know the difference between words like &quot;more&quot;, &quot;bigger&quot; or &quot;longer&quot; yet. When he counted the quarters, he realized that they were the same and wasn&#39;t surprised at all. I think it might also be due to him answering what she expects him to answer, such as when he shook his head to say &quot;no&quot; but verbally said &quot;yes&quot;. The way he does stuff like use his hand to measure the water makes me think that he isn&#39;t misunderstanding what is happening, just misunderstanding definitions and/or answering what he thinks she expects."
gnArvcWaH6I,Talea is that seriously all that you learned from this very interesting psychological experiment? wow
gnArvcWaH6I,"there are kids that struggle to understand that 9 times 6 is the same as 6 times 9 so he is probably part of that category, not the brightest. but then again, work is more important than being born smart so he has all the time in the world."
gnArvcWaH6I,@Bronze Video is more a demonstration than a point. The stages of cognitive development are already well understood to a point it is taught in high-school psyche classes.
gnArvcWaH6I,@CrazyDolphin In this video kid&#39;s  answers are clearly influenced by several factors this test is not scientific it doesnt prove anything
gnArvcWaH6I,"@Bronze To understand how the human brain develops, to understand what is normal for a person of a certain age to understand or not understand, so it can be figured out if a problem is simply that they aren&#39;t old enough, or that it is something else.<br>An understanding of psychology is pretty important for doctors and therapists to know."
gnArvcWaH6I,@CrazyDolphin  Thats stupid like why do you make a test to prove that a 2 year old kid dont have physics knowledge
gnArvcWaH6I,"@Bronze Not physics knowledge, but some level of logical deduction. I suppose the point is to determine when humans generally develop certain abilities. There&#39;s usually tons of applications for seemingly trivially details like this. <br><br>Education is probably the biggest benefactor, in this case. If you know that a child typically cannot understand a certain concept before a certain age, you know not to waste a bunch of time on it before then. <br><br>And sure, a lot of these things are generally pretty obvious, but scientific studies want to know things with more precision. It&#39;s the difference between torqueing a bolt with 10.2 ft. lbs. of force, and &quot;just making it real snug&quot;. Anyone can use the proper tool to apply the same 10.2, but snugging it up is going to vary depending on the person. (I don&#39;t know if 10.2 ft. lbs. is even realistic, just using it as an example)"
gnArvcWaH6I,"Missy Missy they just dont understand the difference between some english words like “more” or “longer” yet, of course he didnt think that the stick magically grew longer or that the amount of playdoh magically increased."
gnArvcWaH6I,@Autumn2Ashes you’re a toddler? Get off YouTube
gnArvcWaH6I,@Julianna I’m only a few months older than the kid in this video. I was already taught this in school man.
gnArvcWaH6I,"Yeah, but you’re not a toddler, are you? Do you watch kids shows explain 1+1 and get mad because you already knew 1+1? If not, then you’re not making sense. If you are, then I don’t even know what to tell you!"
gnArvcWaH6I,"@WiggersART Remember one thing, the person taking your interview is a human as well and has their own bias. Sometimes one can get rejected for baseless external factors. Even if you don&#39;t crack it, don&#39;t be hard on yourself. Learn from the experience and move on. Good luck."
gnArvcWaH6I,@S҉αšuXεX Eh. Okay. I really hope you get to take somebody&#39;s interview someday. You will know. Also stop being a snowflake and work on your communication skills so you don&#39;t have to worry about the &quot;greats&quot; during your interview.
gnArvcWaH6I,@Unnati Senani i expect you to be honest to say truth. that is all. thanks to you and that video now i know one of main reasons why so many people live in fake reality this reason is you and people like you.
gnArvcWaH6I,"OMG, that&#39;s exactly what I do, except when the guy&#39;s answer wasn&#39;t that dumb, then I say &quot;are you sure about that?&quot; to give another chance , lol."
gnArvcWaH6I,Nathaniel because you can fluently speak in the english language
gnArvcWaH6I,"@Marshy Yeah, I know it&#39;s part of psychology. You&#39;d be surprised just how many forget afterwards though. What I learned from psychology is all about the limits of human thought and how we&#39;re essentially still animals, but what most psychologists in the mainstream these days seem to parrot is how humans are anything but animals. Well, I suppose almost all of them are also social psychologists, which rarely amount to anything more than pseudo-scientists and just spread a bunch of nonsense around with no evidence backing it."
gnArvcWaH6I,"@thenonexistinghero I actually learned about this cause of a physchology class I took! Interesting stuff, really"
gnArvcWaH6I,"You seem to be the first one I encounter in the comments who seems to be aware that this showcases perfectly natural development. Children&#39;s logic simply tends to work this way around a certain age, it develops as they mature more and as their brain develops."
gnArvcWaH6I,"Yep, the word &quot;more&quot; can mean way to many things and the &quot;more&quot; we picture when thinking the child is wrong isn&#39;t the same &quot;more&quot; he pictures, i could very wel have said today the smushed playdought take &quot;more&quot; space on the table, and be correct, same ahs for the quarters and the water, we asume quantity, but whe you look at space it take &quot;more&quot; space now, to me those thing just show bias and personification over time for abstract words with multilple meaning, and how we switch from space, to surface, to quantity.<br><br>Most relevant is that has we go by learning about needs of food and water, we learn that hieght isn&#39;t what &#39;more&#39; means, bt the quantity of water is what matter because when thirsty we need that kind of more, not that other one"
gnArvcWaH6I,@yellowmarkers I meant that the kid seemed very intelligent for his age. No sarcasm.
gnArvcWaH6I,Dozerson2 it is typical for a child to not fluently understand the english language at an age like this
gnArvcWaH6I,onlybugwit do you think its normal to not fluently understand a complex language like english?
gnArvcWaH6I,"i think its either because of language barriers (not fully understanding what “more”, “bigger”, “longer” mean yet) or him going for the answer he thinks she wants him to say"
gnArvcWaH6I,These are typically responses for children this age. That&#39;s just how development stages are. Children around this age also typically don&#39;t have a theory of mind yet either. He&#39;s not dumb. You were like this once too.
gnArvcWaH6I,The point wasn&#39;t to &#39;teach&#39; him. For a child that age these are typical answers. You can&#39;t force a child to realize these concepts. It just has to come with age.
gnArvcWaH6I,"@yellowmarkers lies, english is the only language that exists all else are fake"
gnArvcWaH6I,"Tamanui Rei nah, just a language barrier"
gnArvcWaH6I,"@Nao Iwatani &quot;You schizo, schizo&quot; is the equivalent to saying ATM machine. Entirely redundant except this one makes you look a dunce because you&#39;re insulting someone whilst making the mistakes of a midwit."
gnArvcWaH6I,"... Huh. I learned that one quickly, as I wanted to buy things for myself and price mattered. Can&#39;t remember when I learned to count. Early."
gnArvcWaH6I,I&#39;ll tell you a story. When I was 5 before I fully learned the value of money. It was The weekend I know because I wasn&#39;t at school and mum was in bed. I took a £20 note from her purse went to the shop and bought sweets. I took the change back including more notes and put it in her purse. I ate my sweets then done the same took another £20 note and the same. The shop keeper this time became suspicious and asked me where I got the money I said my mum gave it to me and he sold me the sweets again I put the money back mum now had 2x£10 2x£5 a fair few £1 notes and lots of change. <br>To me mum would look in her purse and see lots of money. Mum never said anything. My plan worked. <br>Two days later I was rumbled by the shop keeper lol. Ironically mum never punished me she gave me a stern talking to explained why stealing was bad and I never stole anything from my mum again.
gnArvcWaH6I,When I was 8 I was busting food stamps at the store.
gnArvcWaH6I,@Henrique Lins Wtf your comment never ends
gnArvcWaH6I,@yellowmarkers lol
gnArvcWaH6I,antfbi what the hell
gnArvcWaH6I,@Kool Water hmmm yes
gnArvcWaH6I,@Kool Water oop
gnArvcWaH6I,"I know, that’s typical. Just a stupid scheme applied by an adult and the child is subject to it. <br>TBH i would be looking at the chest of hers comparing it to others I seen at the time. Innocence” try getting stuck with a teacher like that, in less than a year she’ll grow to hate the sob.<br>What’s dangerous is her as an adult in a controlled experiment or not, doesn’t immediately correct the procedure in his thought process and allowing him to understand it’s ok to be fooled. He is obviously catching on to her by the third minute, and believes this female is ok with him being wrong making him ok with it too. Mind is not of value to either of the individuals. Don’t let your kids around strangers."
gnArvcWaH6I,Kid: REEEEEEEEEE
gnArvcWaH6I,"Where does she say &quot;that&#39;s right&quot;? She says &quot;great&quot; and &quot;okay&quot;, which are encouraging without telling him what to say."
gnArvcWaH6I,Qusai Hassan Is that seriously all you got from this interesting psychological experiment?
gnArvcWaH6I,@yellowmarkers yeah I am pretty smart
gnArvcWaH6I,"QuadraxisTheGreat because you know the difference between words like “more”, “longer” and “bigger”."
gnArvcWaH6I,"He probably knows the meaning of those words, he just can&#39;t connect the dots yet. It&#39;s normal for the cognitive development stage he is at"
gnArvcWaH6I,the former
gnArvcWaH6I,😂
gnArvcWaH6I,“The same!”
gnArvcWaH6I,"@Andrey Popov aww that’s a pretty sad story, but deep all the same. I do disagree a bit, (as nobody explicitly told me how age works or the fact that everyone will die) but we often subconsciously come to understand these things as we gain life experience. Some ppl do become denialists when hearing things that contradict with their previous beliefs, but I think that regardless of age, ppl can still change &amp; be open to knew thoughts 😌 whether they’re given the harsh truth as a kid or not, I think we’ll all be ok ❤️"
gnArvcWaH6I,"You should have. They need to learn sooner or later. He would have cried or got angry even in a few years after that if he still didn’t understood that. <br><br>When I was little I watched Lion King. After watching the movie I’ve came to my mom asking why mufasa died. She answered to me truthfully what is death. I asked her: “But you will never die, will you?”. She replied truthfully again: that she, as every human being, will die someday. I started crying uncontrollably for a day. My mom tried to cheer me up by saying “Don’t worry, this will happen in the long future”. But since I was a child it didn’t matter to me. I did not understand what “long” truly meant and that I have a life ahead of me near by mother if I want to. Simply knowing that this will end someday was a shocking enough fact on its own that it didn’t really matter to me if we would live 50 more years with my mom or 1000.<br>But I had to know this. Sooner or later I would have found out this myself and it could have affected my cognition if I understood it too late. I could have become a denialist, saying to myself that death is not true. It happens sometimes to people that believe something for a lot of years and then suddenly have to face the fact that they were incorrect.<br>So the best action here is to be honest to a child and let him cry, let him realize it’s not the end of the world (even though it’s not only rainbows and ponies anymore)."
gnArvcWaH6I,"@Cosmichu what you have and what you are, are 2 different things, I thought we was talking about being something or someone and the thing is I don&#39;t think many people want to be typical, to me it associates with being average, mundane, boring, one of the crowd, I&#39;d personally like to be strong, smart, athletic, hard working etc. And that&#39;s not typical, probably most people also wish to be above average, or consider themselves to be, a typical person is very average.<br>P.s not saying there is anything wrong with being typical, just that I wish to be more."
gnArvcWaH6I,"@greitas opelis typical just means you are sane healthy and have a normal life probably both parents still together has decent grades at school it has nothing to do with personality, everyone is different there isn&#39;t someone that is the same as you no matter what they like or what they think. No one is more special than others we are have weird things and normal things about us don&#39;t compare yourself to others"
gnArvcWaH6I,"@Cosmichu people that want to be unique, different, original, extraordinary"
gnArvcWaH6I,Who doesn&#39;t want to be typical?
gnArvcWaH6I,"@Jonah Rice this actually has been recreated on a much larger scale than just one child, and the results all validate each other independently...did you even look into this topic before you commented this ??"
gnArvcWaH6I,Don&#39;t do me like this
gnArvcWaH6I,ikr they can&#39;t even deal with being left in a hot car for a few hours it&#39;s like just turn on the A/C lol

gnArvcWaH6I,Fresh human
gnArvcWaH6I,Hilarious
gnArvcWaH6I,"@Capn.ducki if thats all you got from this video then you should probably change your perspective a bit because... this person isnt dumb, they probably just dont understand the meaning of the language and/or try to go with the obvious answer thinking that the obvious answer is what she wants him to say."
gnArvcWaH6I,"Seriously, that&#39;s your take after watching this fascinating experiment?"
gnArvcWaH6I,"Neither. We learn the concept of conservation, it&#39;s not a given. It&#39;s fascinating to see it so clearly exposed. I am just as curious to understand how we learn the concept as we grow."
gnArvcWaH6I,How would they respond to the question &quot;which would take longer to drink?*
gnArvcWaH6I,@Grime yeah ure right that kid is smarter than you :P
gnArvcWaH6I,"Yeah, I think the set up of this experiment is flawed. The child probably doesn&#39;t understand what &quot;more&quot;, &quot;longer&quot;, etc. mean. The child just learned that there is a distinction. He explains how one is more stretched out than the other, etc. he probably doesn&#39;t understand the concept of &quot;amount&quot; and just thinks the woman is asking him about which one is higher/longer/bigger, etc. in terms of how he perceives their size relative to each other.<br>Has she explained the concepts of what he asks of him and explained the differences between &quot;more quarters&quot; and &quot;more stretched out quarters&quot;?"
gnArvcWaH6I,@Cuong Nguyen ah ok. My mistake.
gnArvcWaH6I,@Zedekiah It is flawed because It isn&#39;t perfected yet.
gnArvcWaH6I,"@TheKingtedd <br>Uncontrolled factor? Just no. Everybody understands that the kid does not think it was fair. <br><br>Maybe you could argue that since adults (need to) eat more, small children take bodymass into account when thinking about fairness. That would be an uncontrolled factor. <br><br>Or maybe giving atleast some of your own stuff freely, is considered fair, althought the split isn&#39;t 50-50. That would be uncontrolled factor."
gnArvcWaH6I,@Steampunk Wolf  up until the last one he was asked about simpler objective truths with multiple answers bigger smaller and the same <br><br>Then a more nuanced more  complex question with yes or no agree or disagree <br>As a child of talking age no is what your parents tell you when your doing something they don&#39;t like and if you they ask you do something it&#39;s what they don&#39;t like to hear <br>Needless to say now given this is an unfair question
gnArvcWaH6I,@Steampunk Wolf you don’t have to know what social pressure is in order to be influenced by it tho
gnArvcWaH6I,"@TheKingtedd If he couldn&#39;t understand conservation at that age, I highly doubt he knew what social pressure is."
gnArvcWaH6I,@TheKingtedd Absolutely.

gnArvcWaH6I,True
gnArvcWaH6I,"She shouldn&#39;t nod or say right at any point during the experiment.  In fact, there shouldn&#39;t be a person sitting across from the kid at all.  To get the most accurate data, u need to remove any social implications.  This is half a cognition test and half a social obedience test.  That&#39;s fine if it is outlined as such, clearly.  But it would be more interesting to do 2 tests separately."

gnArvcWaH6I,"​@MrFunkadeIic just because there is one word that can be used doesn&#39;t mean other words are incorrect<br>Also, you&#39;re arrogant."
gnArvcWaH6I,Kids are..... Something else
gnArvcWaH6I,"?? Your logic does not make sense..."
gnArvcWaH6I,like what?
gnArvcWaH6I,Same tbh. I’d love to know where I would’ve stood on this.
gnArvcWaH6I,"My Math teacher: &quot;Ok, great!&quot;<br><br>Me: 😭😭😭"
gnArvcWaH6I,"Good Lord, it&#39;s a joke people don&#39;t take it seriously; even a child would understand that this is a joke."
gnArvcWaH6I,so many different personalities in these comments. Its hilarious. <br><br>That researcher in the video would probably have a guilty laugh at the comment that started this thread.
gnArvcWaH6I,"No, all children his age are like this. Including you when you were that young."
gnArvcWaH6I,@Friendly Player He is slow for his age. I used to work at a day care for years and never met a kid with this much cognitive trouble (unless they were actually disabled).
gnArvcWaH6I,"@Fábio Gandini oohh.. so it&#39;s to test out kids&#39; intelligence, got it, thanks"
gnArvcWaH6I,if the kid isn&#39;t smart enough he gets sacrificed to Satan and they use his blood for rituals
gnArvcWaH6I,"The kilo of feathers, of course, because it has many feathers, while the iron is only one! Duh!"
gnArvcWaH6I,You don&#39;t say??? That&#39;s fascinating I tell you! Fascinating!!!!
gnArvcWaH6I,Dihydrotestosterone!
gnArvcWaH6I,Boi pull up a picture of you when you were 4 🤣
gnArvcWaH6I,"His not dumb, he&#39;s special!"
gnArvcWaH6I,You scared me for a second. I thought you were going to talk about a secret room in your basement.
gnArvcWaH6I,There&#39;s nothing wrong with him - the title says he&#39;s a typical child. It&#39;s just that kids his age can&#39;t comprehend volume/quantity/placement vs. size. It&#39;s a normal stage of child development.
gnArvcWaH6I,Haha
gnArvcWaH6I,"They would give the correct answers for the tests, or at least to most of them. It’s not until about 7 or 8 that children start developing an understanding for the concept of conservation. So a non-typical child would’ve reached the age of development or had already developed the understanding prior."
gnArvcWaH6I,It still doesn&#39;t make any sense. How is he not remembering that those are the same amount? It was literally changed in front of his eyes.
gnArvcWaH6I,"It actually makes a difference with wages, though. The amount taxed slightly differs between getting paid every two weeks and twice a month."
gnArvcWaH6I,🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
gnArvcWaH6I,😂😂
gnArvcWaH6I,😂
gnArvcWaH6I,That one hit for some reason
gnArvcWaH6I,Eats one of her cracker pieces. she asks if that was fair. then he gives her one of his smaller ones. stonck
gnArvcWaH6I,@Sreram K But if you change the structure aren&#39;t you changing the quantity of the structure?
gnArvcWaH6I,I swear I read the son&#39;s line in Stewie&#39;s voice.
gnArvcWaH6I,"Kids can&#39;t figure this out. They tend to believe changing the structure also changes the quantity: <a href=""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_(psychology)"">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_(psychology)</a>"
gnArvcWaH6I,"@Fatbunnies27 lmao, it can be a dog depending of the point of view jajajajaj"
gnArvcWaH6I,@Isabela Monadyr i really did just call it a dog didn&#39;t i 🤦‍♂️ smh im dumb
gnArvcWaH6I,I can&#39;t believe a comment referencing an obscure Scottish streamer is a top comment on this video.
gnArvcWaH6I,"@Terry Fulds GamingI think you didn&#39;t get the sarcasm bro, anyway"
gnArvcWaH6I,"@Terry Fulds Gaming no, that&#39;s not at all what I&#39;m talking about."
gnArvcWaH6I,@Terry Fulds Gaming The question is not about what is more mass: 1 kg of feathers or 1 kg of steel. The question is about weight which is a magnitude of the reaction force exerted on a body by mechanisms that counteract the effects of gravity. The answer actually depends on how you define the weight but it would be obviously a stupid problem if the answer was &quot;they are the same&quot;.
gnArvcWaH6I,@Yatin Gajapure let me put both on a scale then you tell me which is heavier...
gnArvcWaH6I,"@Ryan Craig Ah, that helps. Thank you!"
gnArvcWaH6I,The point Piaget made with these conversion tasks was that children are incapable of noticing the differences between the converted objects until age six or seven. So in reality no child should be able to correctly complete these tasks until age six or seven. If you know any young children you should test it out for yourself.
gnArvcWaH6I,like your literally fooling a 4 year old with optical illusions he hasn&#39;t learnt measurement at all tryin to make a 4 yr old read between the lines is like having a 4 year old d up on Kobe Bryant get outtah here with this waste of time.
gnArvcWaH6I,@Fernando Sanchez yes how did you know
gnArvcWaH6I,Im guessing you did based on a wikipedia article
gnArvcWaH6I,"Kids don&#39;t have object permanence until around four, so he didn&#39;t think abour where all the extra coins/water/stick length are coming from cause he didn&#39;t understand that you can&#39;t pull something from nothing"
gnArvcWaH6I,"@Maeve Robidoux yup. Children, until about 7 or 8, haven’t developed the ability of logical thinking to be able to understand the concept of the same volume, number, or size unless they’re essentially the same visually. The most noticeable tends to be in the case of volume due to the highest discrepancy in visual difference, yet they’re the same amount in both glasses. You could see him using his hands to measure the “water line”  as his only point of reference and understanding to compare. These concepts are just beyond a child’s comprehension at this state of their mental and cognitive development."
gnArvcWaH6I,It&#39;s not. It&#39;s just a perfect example of neurotypical children thought process.
gnArvcWaH6I,"Ok. If someone would do this to me, but without showing up their work. yes I would say the same."
gnArvcWaH6I,almost like dem voters :D
gnArvcWaH6I,Children do not develop the logic and reasoning to realize they have not changed their measurable quantities.
gnArvcWaH6I,"@Socratic I can remember as a small child, when adults would do this type of thing, replying with things I didn&#39;t actually think, trying to hit on what it was the adult wanted to hear because the questions seemed obvious or pointless and I didn&#39;t get what they were trying to do"
gnArvcWaH6I,"@BenRangel Well: &quot;I&#39;m thirsty, give me the glass with the most water&quot; or &quot;I&#39;m trying to scratch my back, give me the longest stick&quot; would be the wrong, because it forces the kid to pick one of two (or more) options regardless if the kid knows if they are the same or not, because it&#39;s not like he is going to refuse to give you a glass of water just because it&#39;s the same amount in both. It&#39;s more likely he will ignore the literal wording of your request in favor of giving you water than say: &quot;I won&#39;t give you any water then.&quot;"
gnArvcWaH6I,@iEclipse no
gnArvcWaH6I,That&#39;s what she said
gnArvcWaH6I,@Qwerty user same for me. I read it once and was like umm ok then read it again and was like oooooooo I get it
gnArvcWaH6I,@Jan Černín Shit man I should sleep more. I was too tired so I didn&#39;t read it thoroughly.
gnArvcWaH6I,"Nah, these tests famously work on kids around this age."
gnArvcWaH6I,"parents tried this with me as a kid, apparently it doesn&#39;t work on everyone"
gnArvcWaH6I,You were great in this video. I didn&#39;t know biden suporters could count to five.
gnArvcWaH6I,"Yeah, im really amazed he managed to get every question right"
gnArvcWaH6I,I am still asking myself how this woman managed to make more quarters
gnArvcWaH6I,He is very smart for his age. I just don&#39;t think he understood the true meaning of more as it pertained to volume.
gnArvcWaH6I,Ironic comment since it&#39;s the Republicans doing this with population density.
gnArvcWaH6I,LoL
gnArvcWaH6I,That kid is now in charge of the Federal Reserve
gnArvcWaH6I,LOL😅😁💵
gnArvcWaH6I,This caught me off guard
gnArvcWaH6I,Mitosis!
gnArvcWaH6I,@Barry Chuckle whats that
gnArvcWaH6I,"Great point - yes, the stick analogy is literally how daylight savings works"
gnArvcWaH6I,"No one believed that daylight savings time &quot;added&quot; time to the day. It was implemented so that during the times people were up and working, the sun would also be up (thus saving money on candles/lights/energy). Less day time being wasted while you&#39;re still asleep in the morning."
gnArvcWaH6I,"When told the reason for daylight savings time the Old Indian said, &quot;Only the government would believe that you could cut a foot off the top of a blanket, sew it to the bottom, and have a longer blanket.&quot;"
gnArvcWaH6I,That&#39;s it in a nutshell...Deeply underappreciated comment!
gnArvcWaH6I,Yup.
gnArvcWaH6I,@Александар Explaining and forcing are different things.
gnArvcWaH6I,"Every child develpes these skills alone, interfirning and forcing them to learn by feeding information can have the opposite effect"
gnArvcWaH6I,@Lyle McDermott it’s a meme
gnArvcWaH6I,It&#39;s an addition.
gnArvcWaH6I,"All his answers are logical, understandable and typical of a child that age. None of those things are the same as correct though. He was not correct in many of the answers."
gnArvcWaH6I,Common core more like lack of common sense
gnArvcWaH6I,Feathers weigh more. Because you have to live with the fact of what you did to those poor birds.
gnArvcWaH6I,"1 kilo of feathers is heavier, because you have to deal with the mental and emotional weight of having slaughtered enough birds to produce a kilo of feathers."
gnArvcWaH6I,"@Ivan M. well, if you follow everyday experience, a kilogramme of steel would weigh more"
gnArvcWaH6I,"@Vladislav Sukhmel It&#39;s because you follow the logic and everyday experience. Metal is usually in small, long or flat heavy forms. Feathers are usually in sacks due to their properties, like pillows and so on. That&#39;s natural, we&#39;re not distorting the reality to get a voluntary outcome. The main argument was that this wrong topic led people to answer incorrectly to the question, how can something too elaborate feel natural?"
gnArvcWaH6I,"Everyone here keeps saying about compressing feathers, but a kg of steel can also be an empty sphere of steel, not a ball. In fact an answer depends on how you weigh and what are effective densities, because of Archimedes force excerted by the atmosphere, as far as I understand."
gnArvcWaH6I,I searched for it because I&#39;m a psych major lmao
gnArvcWaH6I,Anticlimactic
gnArvcWaH6I,And when he&#39;s asked if the cookie sharing is fair he says &quot;yes&quot; even if he&#39;s shaking his head with no 😂
gnArvcWaH6I,Brain stuff is prett weird
gnArvcWaH6I,@u k? I was thinking this too. He may just be answering based on how he thinks she wants him to answer.
gnArvcWaH6I,HAHAHA SAME OH MY GOD. I thought his state of disequilibrium would be sooo evident lmao
gnArvcWaH6I,Actually now you have to buy a charger separate for your phone😂
gnArvcWaH6I,Yep
gnArvcWaH6I,Because his brain has not yet developed enough to answer these questions correctly. Which is completely normal at this age
gnArvcWaH6I,Thank God! Finally there is someone who knows Piaget 😌
gnArvcWaH6I,ok 5head

gnArvcWaH6I,Most useful comment :p
gnArvcWaH6I,Omg same i will use this trick Imfao
gnArvcWaH6I,Me too
gnArvcWaH6I,same hahaha
gnArvcWaH6I,You can see it in his answers.<br>&quot;This one is <i>more</i> because these five coins are further apart than those five&quot;.<br>&quot;These balls aren&#39;t <i>the same</i> because you squished one&quot;.<br>He knows there is an equal quantity of coins but has a different meaning of the word &quot;more&quot; etc.
gnArvcWaH6I,"or maybe you could get some plastic cups.<br><br>the opposite is also true. you can figure out the health of the economy by how big the hole is in a tube of toothpaste. &quot;i put the same amount of toothpaste as always, i just cover the bristles! so why is it running out so fast?&quot;"
gnArvcWaH6I,"Sounds a bit like Adam and Eve, In all fairness, let&#39;s see them do this same &quot;test&quot; with a girl of the same age.  Cheers Edit, then every comment will be that&#39;s not fair she&#39;s just a little girl, give her a break, she doesn&#39;t understand that yet. you were mean to her, you tricked and lied to her. end of rant"
gnArvcWaH6I,@capnskiddies that is so amazing. Thank you :)
gnArvcWaH6I,They can&#39;t interpret volume properly. They have only seen that more = numerically more. Their concept of quantity is limited to a single dimension
gnArvcWaH6I,"The point is showing what stage in development children develop the ability to understand tests such as these. It&#39;s part of developmental psychology.<br>&quot;Conservation refers to a logical thinking ability that allows a person to determine that a certain quantity will remain the same despite adjustment of the container, shape, or apparent size, according to the psychologist Jean Piaget. His theory posits that this ability is not present in children during the preoperational stage of their development at ages 2–7 but develops in the concrete operational stage from ages 7–11.&quot;"
gnArvcWaH6I,"@RomanceJones it&#39;s understandable. His country probably reads left to right, so the father something left is the longer it may be. Or maybe he was reading tones of the conversation to know when to act contrarian. Or he may be stupid. It&#39;s really difficult to tell, and I know it&#39;s not the video&#39;s job to tell me, but I feel unsatisfied too."
gnArvcWaH6I,Really? You need to have understanding of size and volume to actually not fall for the trick where she.. Moves the stick?
gnArvcWaH6I,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnArvcWaH6I&amp;t=0m00s"">0:00</a> to <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnArvcWaH6I&amp;t=3m49s"">3:49</a> people who don&#39;t understand that marginal tax isn&#39;t the same as your effective tax.<br><br><br><br><br>If there&#39;s a 40% marginal tax on income over $1 million, and you make 1 million and one dollars a year, then you only pay 40% on that 1 dollar."
gnArvcWaH6I,This. Screw that; I received a bonus the other day and taxes were taken out of it!
gnArvcWaH6I,@Andréas Skogholm I agree with you on that.
gnArvcWaH6I,@Tasnema Tarannum yeah of course. But i don&#39;t think that was what Aron ment.
gnArvcWaH6I,"@Andréas Skogholm that holds too, doesn&#39;t it? For kids of the same age, that is."
gnArvcWaH6I,@Tasnema Tarannum nah I think she rather mean: todays kids. How would the kids today react.
gnArvcWaH6I,"@Andréas Skogholm I think Ellie means that now that he&#39;s at least 13+, his reaction would be similar to us adults as he likely understands the scenarios."
gnArvcWaH6I,For this interaction seems he does not know the concept of volume. The conservation question is not proper setup.
gnArvcWaH6I,"Samia Batchelor finally, thank you for explaining what this video is. It’s scary how many people will comment their opinions and conjectures without knowing the first thing."
gnArvcWaH6I,@Андрей Фамильев I&#39;m not calling anyone stupid. I asked if he is stupid. Like somebody would maybe know what is smart/dumb at that age.
gnArvcWaH6I,Children at that age doesn&#39;t understand quantity that well. You&#39;d fail that test either at his age. Calling this kid stupid is like calling an infant stupid because he can&#39;t speak.
gnArvcWaH6I,"@Julian Baxter Well good debate, I don&#39;t think we changed each others minds,However I do appreciate the civil discussion.I sometimes find it strange that the most noninflammatory things can lead to arguments online."
gnArvcWaH6I,"I hate how this can keep happening until adulthood and they will just let him assume he&#39;s right all the time...He just learned it&#39;s ok to throw out the first thing that crosses his mind as fast as he can as this way he will keep the stimuli coming. Children are easily stimulated by any activity and they actively seek that stimulation. That&#39;s why they will run around and around grabbing random toys until the TVs on and then they just get absorbed into it, as it has more informatory components to process...that&#39;s almost borderline manic behaviour but that&#39;s also why correcting him at this age is critical to provide the stimulus of critical thinking."
gnArvcWaH6I,"@Julian Baxter Again, some good points.<br>And I also agree about the &quot;100%&quot; truth people, there is no functioning adult in the world who has not lied at one time or another.We all lie, but no mater the justification, a lie, is a lie, is a lie(To paraphrase the Bard). Truth HURTS, but pain is a teacher, and to shun her to spare ones self, or even another, is a grave mistake. &quot;Tact&quot; and a &quot;Silver tongue&quot; do not,a moral person make."
gnArvcWaH6I,"@Julian Baxter Well spoken,I apologize I am a key board warrior,I admit.However,I stand by my statement,in the end no amount of damage caused by the reality of a situation could equal the cost of the lack of information. Even in some of your examples the truth is critical to the well being of the individual Or their loved ones. for instance: your five minute man: Any time wasted on gently telling him the truth will lessen the time he has to set his affair&#39;s in order. I don&#39;t like cruelty, or spitefulness, however we live each day in darkness, not knowing the future, we NEED ALL the information we can <a href=""http://get.to/"">get.To</a> hold back information could be catastrophic.<br>Why do you think every government on Earth has a dedicated intelligence agency?      <br>Compassion is a wonderful thing,but it must never out weigh practicality."
gnArvcWaH6I,@Julian Baxter It wasn&#39;t meant to be funny.<br>Truth can never cause more suffering than a lie.Prove me wrong.
gnArvcWaH6I,"But he gets every thing wrong. Would you rather have a child that gets nothing right and is patient and well mannered, or one that isn&#39;t but gets everything right?"
gnArvcWaH6I,"@Sownheard would you rather have an inattentive, rowdy misbehaving child to deal with?"
gnArvcWaH6I,@Kingshuk Monsur to not say the right answer
gnArvcWaH6I,"He’s like, “why is this lady asking me the same questions, it’s so obvious!” lol"
gnArvcWaH6I,Probably that he develops faster than he should. Mean he&#39;s probably genius.
gnArvcWaH6I,"@Doris G Greer he didn&#39;t 😭 i had to explain to him why he was being scammed, then i gave him his money back lmao"
gnArvcWaH6I,Hope he got his revenge
gnArvcWaH6I,"Do you mean young instead of small or does his height and weight contribute to this? Just kidding 😄 I agree with you, he is trying to work out what she wants him to say."
gnArvcWaH6I,"This is actually very accurate, because the main problem of solving the world hunger isn&#39;t growing enough food. The problem is moving the food to where it isn&#39;t so plenty."
gnArvcWaH6I,😂😂
gnArvcWaH6I,This comment made me laugh so hard.
gnArvcWaH6I,"@Res Publica I wonder who is wasteful... fertile countries that cannot organize farming or rich countries that can, but decide to throw things away they don&#39;t need (which then ends up in biological waste which again might be used as fertilizer).<br><br>The question can be answered with a peek to South Africa."
gnArvcWaH6I,Considering how wasteful the rich countries are with the food this statement is true.
gnArvcWaH6I,Hand a prize over to this guy.
gnArvcWaH6I,"My 4 year old son does strange things with mathematics, as he has amazing memory / near photographic memory. He will tell me 9 is a square number 3 by 3, 16 is 4x4 and 25 is 5x5. He memorises the numbers and tells me these things, so when say we go past a house, that is 9 he will comment - &quot;that house is 9, its a square number&quot;.. but if i give him 9 square blocks and ask him to make a square, he is befuddled. I think he memorises number sequences but doesn&#39;t understand how they relate to each other. Other examples are Time and clocks he memorises the hand positions on the clock says 7pm bed time. But he he doesn&#39;t follow the sequence. He is bright and it will come."
gnArvcWaH6I,yea good point
gnArvcWaH6I,"I think it&#39;s a combination of both. But you&#39;re right, even grown adults will more often than not just go along with what they think is expected by someone with more authority."
gnArvcWaH6I,I study Psychology and can tell you that you are probably right. The original Piagetian task is the one with the water glass. You can see the child clearly compare the two glasses by putting them together and basking his judgement off that. However his other responded are probably due to demand characteristics- participants doing what they think is expected of them. The first task with the coins has been replicated in a way that it is not the experimenter moving the coins but a so called naughty teddy. Then when asked which roll is bigger the children don&#39;t make a mistake. That is because they don&#39;t interpret the action with the same meaning. When an experimenter does it and then asks the question the child is trying to guess what the experimenter wants him to say. You can see that especially at the last task when first he saysyes then when she is not satisfied with the answer he says no.<br>The child child compares the glasses by putting them together but not the sticks that she moves why is that? His answer is longer because you moved it. Meaning because you did something to it and I am expected to notice the change and answer accordingly.
gnArvcWaH6I,Lmao now you habe trust issues<br>Rip
gnArvcWaH6I,"@Snob_Who_Panics Well, if you move the popped pop corns further apart from each other, you can eat more."
gnArvcWaH6I,"Mass is about density,<br> not volume. <br><br>Either way, a popcorn purchase feels like a scam whether popped or not ."
gnArvcWaH6I,Logan I’m sorry to hear that. I just feel the test is flawed from the start as they are both referencing different things.
gnArvcWaH6I,"I don&#39;t know, they demonstrated it well.  I remember having this test done on me as a kid, and I felt embarrassed afterwards.  That was the day I learned what volume was."
gnArvcWaH6I,So I assume there is no law where you are that states the glasses in restaurants and bars need to have a calibration mark?<br>Because where I am that is the case. Only exception are glasses used to serve mixed drinks that contain alcohol.
gnArvcWaH6I,DQ blizzards be so skinny
gnArvcWaH6I,@TK W that wouldn’t work I would just see that it is a smaller plate because a potato is a potato is a potato they are all similar size

gnArvcWaH6I,LOL facts

gnArvcWaH6I,You were on those medival scale rules
gnArvcWaH6I,"Einstein said: &quot;if you can&#39;t explain it to a 6 year old, you don&#39;t understand it yourself&quot; this is absolutely true"

gnArvcWaH6I,Especially if you ask him if it is still the same!
gnArvcWaH6I,"@Thomas, I know that feeling."
gnArvcWaH6I,"@Artist with a wandering eye Thanks for the answer, straight to point."
gnArvcWaH6I,Its meant to show that kids that age don&#39;t have the skill of conservation.
gnArvcWaH6I,"@KV33 , the government could easily inconvenience those citizens eligible for the stimulus if they forced them to collect their stimulus cash in coin form ( even if the total coins are worth more )"
gnArvcWaH6I,"@KVND What I&#39;m saying is that he seemed to interpret the meaning of &quot;more&quot; to be taller, as in which one has more height, not necessarily the concept of which one has more of the play doh material.  I think at that age he understands the difference in properties but doesn&#39;t have the vocabulary to define it.  Unfortunately teaching him the vocabulary requires defining the concept for him, which in turn teaches him the concept and nullifies the experiment."
gnArvcWaH6I,"Well she asked him which has more play-doh and he said one had less after being squished down, then had more after being rolled up so...also the fact that it wasn&#39;t &quot;fair&quot; for her to get double the food but it was fair once his was halved"
gnArvcWaH6I,Reward with sugar ? Hmm

gnArvcWaH6I,"it&#39;s still the same mass of play&#39;doh though... it depends on what you count as &quot;more&quot;. More mass, or more volume?"

gnArvcWaH6I,"@Sara Flint exactly. His answers were all correct for his age, understanding and vocab. This stuff is taught in school a couple of years later. Interesting that so many older (than a 3 year old) people in this comment  section aren&#39;t acknowleging this. I guess they think they were born knowing everything they think they know. 😂"
gnArvcWaH6I,@Jessica Taylor i agree
gnArvcWaH6I,"@Pieter Cuijpers Demand characteristics are present no matter the age of the person. Psychologist often conduct double blind experiments meaning that both the participant and the experimenter that is interacting with the participant are unaware of the true purpose of the task/ experiment. <br>For a school environment I would look at TheSolarFuture Enthusiast&#39;s comment. The school system punishes the students for making mistakes, sometimes you get a better result meaning a better grade if you say the right thing even if you don&#39;t understand the reasoning behind it instead of saying what you do understand in your own words. My personal opinion is that if students were insentivised to make mistakes they would be speaking thinking for themselves and their opinion on a certain topic rather than the right answer."
gnArvcWaH6I,"Interesting, many re- occuring vids that are 10 months older then March 2021 that has comment on them. Waves of re recommendation?"
gnArvcWaH6I,"@llriv Yes and if it is explained these are worth $1 each and this is worth $5 he could understand that too. He showed he can understand the concepts when there is clarity in what he is supposed to be comparing. As soon as she got him to count the coins in the rows then asked him again, he understood what aspect she was refering to and answered correctly."
gnArvcWaH6I,"@Maaden_Swe If I say, &quot;I am a lion&quot; children laugh, scream and run away so they can &#39;be chased by the lion&#39;. It doesn&#39;t mean they think I am a real lion or don&#39;t know what a real lion is. A lack of cognitive ability restricts children a lot less than adults restricting what they teach due to their assumption the child lacks the cognitive ability to understand!"
gnArvcWaH6I,@Jessica Taylor you really dont understand why? I really hope you dont work with kids
gnArvcWaH6I,He might not understand what SHE is meaning by them. Why change stuff and ask if it&#39;s the same? Obviously she wants him to say one is different and explain why he chose it. If she put 2 black straws on a table and told him to choose the red one he&#39;d probably choose one in order to please!
gnArvcWaH6I,Just Gamer she isn’t trying to teach him anything. It’s a thought experiment designed to show that children before a certain point don’t understand certain concepts.
gnArvcWaH6I,Zing
gnArvcWaH6I,Are people actually showing loyalty to ANY * beaurocrat?*
gnArvcWaH6I,I know right!

gnArvcWaH6I,"It shows how children at that age can have some form of logical understanding, even without contextually undestanding things like spatial volume versus amounts. Children are also able to apply their logic and reasoning of the world and its used to teach adults why they cannot force more complex concepts on their children before they are ready."

gnArvcWaH6I,"​@my opinion I was going to say that you need help... then i used my common sense and imagined a person: someone you don&#39;t know with an intention (an &#39;agenda&#39;). Why is having an intention a bad thing? It literally just means a person is planning ahead... you really saying that planning ahead is a sinister thing? <br>^ that is common sense. I took what you said and created a rhetorical image to gain a deeper understanding of the principal I&#39;m being asked to believe. I visualized the result and found it created a cognitive dissonance if I were to take it as anything serious or impactful. I have experience with teachers, who have an &#39;agenda&#39; to perform well at work, based on whatever metric they are judged on. I have experience with doctors, who have an agenda to run a successful practice,  whatever that means to them. Some of those teachers were myopic in their scope and did not perform well, some of those doctors made me feel like a customer.<br>The long and short of it is, you have no idea what common sense is. Or if you do you didn&#39;t choose to &#39;flex&#39; it when deriding the virtue of trust and honesty. I mean its been a virtue in western culture for 4 thousand years and you think an edgy youtube comment advocating shallow isolation is a good look?"
gnArvcWaH6I,@J Murphy unlucky that you think that
gnArvcWaH6I,"Trent Gustus Science is always changing and always proving what we thought we knew wrong. Politics is when no change is allowed, and science is deemed as fake.<br>Science told us the world isn’t flat, politics said it is. Science told us the Earth is not the center of the universe nor our solar system, politics said it is. Science told us how infectious diseases are spread, how to prevent the spread, symptoms of diseases, dangers of pre-existing genetic conditions corroborating with diseases, and if all else fails, treatments. Politics says it’s not real, it can’t transfer, it’s not dangerous, preventative measures don’t work, etc.<br>You’re confusing politics with science. Science doesn’t fit your agenda, so you’ll hide behind politics so you never have to accept you’re wrong."
gnArvcWaH6I,"@Trent Gustus Not all people are scientifically litterate (myself included, to a large extent), and you can&#39;t expect them all to be or to keep up with scientific litterature. Most of the population needs an authority figure when it comes to important knowledge that comes from a certain expertise, knowledge that shape our actions but that we cannot replicate through our own research and experiments. <br>When a consensus exists, for things like round earth or climate change, it&#39;s absolutely reasonnable to use it as an appeal to authority. One does not need to understand the logic and studies themselves to understand that a large enough scientific consensus, is much more likely in the right than whatever the other party is presenting. Not to mention that said other party isn&#39;t more &quot;thinking for itself&quot;, their authority figures are just different. Refering to an authority like this doesn&#39;t make one right, scientific consensus has been wrong many times in the past (although what people forget to mention is that said consensus almost always change when truly confronted with better evidence), but when you lack the education and the time to really get a certain level of expertise on the subject, you need to choose a source that you find trustworthy enough, and the scientific community as a whole when they are in almost unanimous agreement is as good of a source as you can get.<br><br>Also, I might be wrong on this, but isn&#39;t the replication crisis mostly a problem within psychology ? Psychology has been know for its bogus methodology for a while, so I don&#39;t think a major lack of evidence in psychology is necessarely a problem that also reflects poorly on modern science and social science as a whole. <br><br>Things like the replication crisis are important problems, but they have often been blown out of proportion and paraded around to dismiss the scientific process and any and all scientific consensus when convenient. There is a political and economic interest to undermine the trust the public has for science as a whole, especially when faced with overwhelming evidence on subjects like climate change or some aspects of social science. <br><br>This rethoric that Trent Gustus is using of demanding people to include &quot;all sorts of science&quot; is an attempt at shifting the burden of proof solely on their opponent. If fact check sites lacks evidence, surely this can be pointed out. Same about studies and scientific consensus that are paraded around, if their method and the evidence they provide isn&#39;t good enough, surely people like Trent could provide a better study, right ? That&#39;s how the scientific process works after all, peer review is an important part of science, hence why refering to a scientific consensus when there is one often makes more sense than your usual appeal to authority. <br><br>The truth is that they can&#39;t because the &quot;other science&quot; that they have doesn&#39;t provide better evidence, and isn&#39;t peer reviewed. One would have to either be naive or somewhat dishonnest to not recognize this rethoric for what it is."
gnArvcWaH6I,"Deep analogy, love it"
gnArvcWaH6I,It&#39;s Jean Piaget&#39;s study on conservation. He postulated that very young children do not develop conservation ability. Which means that they cannot identify the volume of things and get deceived by the shapes and sizes of objects
gnArvcWaH6I,Mike Richard If you can get the questions right then you win a lollipop
gnArvcWaH6I,@KillerRobot99 are we allowed to account for time in these questions ? Or is it a dead vacuum of assertions ?

gnArvcWaH6I,"I sometimes wonder though, if their brains aren&#39;t developed enough physiologically to grasp the problems, would they really understand? Or would they just memorise the &quot;correct&quot; answer? I can remember as a child struggling to understand long division. <br><br>I also remember my father trying to explain the concept of mass to me (he specifically used the word &#39;stuff&#39;) and I couldn&#39;t really grasp it. It was really frustrating to me because I always wanted to be on an equal footing with adults, so realising I wasn&#39;t there yet confounded me. Especially as I knew I was more intellectually developed than the average child of my age."

gnArvcWaH6I,Laura Hargreaves you said that perfectly
gnArvcWaH6I,@Cosmic Dissonance you spelled conservation as conversation and it threw me off
gnArvcWaH6I,"I&#39;d say, Mr.Cosmic, that you are living up to your username :p just to preface, I do not wish to argue or be inflammatory. Let me point out, however, that while you have illustrated your reductionist perspective on this theory, you have, at the same time, appealed to absolutes (non-random patterns) that are not dependant upon experience/perception to make your point (also check out chaos theory... There&#39;s certainly no such thing as random in our universe...). The purpose of my initial comment was simply to spur you along to acknowledging that, indeed, there are greater forces at work than what we &quot;know&quot; about. I would argue that your appeal to absolutes is totally reasonable, though contradictory to the perspective for which you are arguing. If humans have no innate knowledge, which we certainly do (how would one learn to feel? This is something that, theoretically, is completely subjective and as such could not be taught or explained. Emotions are a type of knowledge/information, albeit one that is not well understood. There areany examples such as this.), Then there is no such thing as attainable ascents to absolute truth claims and as such your argument for that very thing is made null. It collapses on itself."
gnArvcWaH6I,"Cosmic Dissonance Hydrogen. Uh huh. I think you should have just used „water“, might not have looked like a fool then."
gnArvcWaH6I,Eww. Leave that where you found it. Don&#39;t take it.
gnArvcWaH6I,"He point is that for the kid, there are no laws of physics. Their minds are so open that they will accept everything they observe as true and reconstruct the rules based on that. At this age, he will adjust whatever he thought was a &quot;law&quot; to conform to what you showed him instead of being surprised that you broke the law."
gnArvcWaH6I,Brendan Maher You mustn&#39;t correct a student during a test. If they were doing a lesson plan she would have explained it. But you never teach someone by letting them getting answers wrong and then correcting them.
gnArvcWaH6I,"@abbreviatedalex I understand that, however I&#39;m not saying the woman needs to explain this scientifically, inside and out, to a child. I wouldn&#39;t expect him to get it. I know it&#39;s all about how he&#39;s perceiving his world around him. But in my opinion, it&#39;d be good to at least show him that they&#39;re still the same things, no matter how much they&#39;re manipulated."

gnArvcWaH6I,You should change your username to Captain Obvious.
gnArvcWaH6I,I remember learning about object permanence in child development. Never thought I&#39;d hear the word again
gnArvcWaH6I,"@iota-09 many people have memories from 2-3 years old. When i learned these things in a class of 300 students, 1/3 had memories from that time. A few may have been manufactured, but obviously not all."
gnArvcWaH6I,"@Lychee Myusic perhaps, but u can&#39;t remember absolutely anything from before 4 years old, maybe one or two memories that have as much detail as dreams form decades ago."
gnArvcWaH6I,@Stuti Naik very true
gnArvcWaH6I,"@Shlad yea I know he is a kid, I&#39;m just saying that the way he responds is a way alot of older people will respond to when it comes to buying new products. I was just making a comparison, because I saw alot of comments calling this kid stupid and what not"
gnArvcWaH6I,No this kid is just being a kid. It&#39;s not that deep
gnArvcWaH6I,Stiuw is hefia then fetas
gnArvcWaH6I,@Lenny Cuellar Can&#39;t wait to experience this myself someday.
gnArvcWaH6I,"I have a 2 and 4 year old... Yes, yes we were"
gnArvcWaH6I,"Actually, no. Those experiments were invented before television by Piaget, who&#39;s only the most famous psychologist to have studied child development. Every child has a cognitive development that goes through some stages and this particolar stage Is cleared arount the Age of 6. It&#39;s the same reason why Kids Who have less than a year think their mom disappears when She hides behind her hands. They&#39;re not stupids, their brain Is Just developing. This happens to every child, regardless of television, neglecting parents and such. And It means that you too would have made those mistakes at that Age. If you don&#39;t trust me Just look It up in any psychology book"
gnArvcWaH6I,@subna03 XD You and NicoleL ...because you have the same picture
gnArvcWaH6I,Hahaha
gnArvcWaH6I,"@Katie Guinn Thank you Katie, you managed to paraphrase the title of the video wonderfully"
gnArvcWaH6I,Nordic Mind I LOLed
gnArvcWaH6I,Hargey _ She isn&#39;t correcting him or confirming his answers though
gnArvcWaH6I,AleXiz ! Notice she never confirms her answers. This is to about the child just trying to appease the adult. She just says &quot;ok&quot; and &quot;great&quot;. Kids want to hear &quot;that&#39;s right! Correct! You&#39;re so smart!&quot;
gnArvcWaH6I,HAHAHAHAHA
gnArvcWaH6I,"@Jenny L Right...IF you can afford it.  Most people can&#39;t afford it, yet they do it anyway because they have the same mental capacity as this child.  That&#39;s why most people are in debt and live paycheck to paycheck."
gnArvcWaH6I,"@goeiecool9999 In other words...you would take out a $100,000 loan for coffee?😂  You are missing my point which is that many (I would say most) people are so short-sighted that they cannot extrapolate the daily, weekly, or monthly cost of something over their lifetimes and thus believe that they can afford it."
gnArvcWaH6I,Why do you think people take loans. Is because they don&#39;t have a lot of money at one specific moment. Taking a loan spreads the financial load out over a long time which allows you to pay for something you otherwise couldn&#39;t.
gnArvcWaH6I,"Reuben Jacques Who has 100,000$ just lying around? If you have a job that pays you decent money then you can probably afford that cup of coffee"
gnArvcWaH6I,I don&#39;t understand your take.

gnArvcWaH6I,Yes
gnArvcWaH6I,"@Drinker_Of_ Milk <br>It&#39;s to provide a scale of sorts, I guess."
gnArvcWaH6I,Thats awesome
gnArvcWaH6I,i was the 420th like. dont ruin it
gnArvcWaH6I,Hello my brothers. I just got here. Sorry for being late
gnArvcWaH6I,So true
gnArvcWaH6I,Ain&#39;t this the truth
gnArvcWaH6I,Good for you
gnArvcWaH6I,"Because you know, whatever she does, it&#39;s the same."
gnArvcWaH6I,@oh yeah nahui  yeah nahui
gnArvcWaH6I,Are the people saying cringe actually taking it seriously?
gnArvcWaH6I,Don’t do me dirty like that
gnArvcWaH6I,"Hell yeah, I&#39;m wasting my time on reading threads like these. Nothing better than wondering why certain human beings exist in the Internet."
gnArvcWaH6I,"@J Davi not true, lions go for giraffes and elephants. They are bigger and taller than humans."
gnArvcWaH6I,I wouldn&#39;t be able to tell if I wasn&#39;t shown the original two identical glasses. I wouldn&#39;t be able to identify the ratio change in width to length and hoe it affected the water&#39;s shape.
gnArvcWaH6I,@Green Giant lol
gnArvcWaH6I,"@медведь Right.  Whatever you say. You&#39;re a really rude person to pick on a baby. But, I guess that&#39;s just how people get by sometimes,  picking on innocent babies to make themselves feel bigger. Whatever you have to do to get through the day! Hope your life gets better! Xoxo"
gnArvcWaH6I,Delicate Disaster Sounds like you are malding yourself why don’t you calm down.
gnArvcWaH6I,"@медведь &quot;Malding&quot;? Really? You clearly do not have a child.  Children grow hair at all different rates. For some, their &quot;big kid hair&quot; doesn&#39;t come in until very late. They&#39;ll lose their baby hair and then grow their hair after that, especially in babies who are premature. Hes not &quot;Malding&quot;, he is growing. And the fact that you&#39;re calling it &quot;Malding&quot; shows how immature and rude you are. Grow up. Insulting someone&#39;s baby is a pathetic thing to do."
gnArvcWaH6I,He is malding though if you look at his hairline.
gnArvcWaH6I,"@Alex Hebi I&#39;m fully aware of that. I&#39;m a ECE teacher.  If you read what I said, I mentioned that I was going off of his face. His face is similar to the 2yo/3yo class I used to teach, so I was expecting basic communication skills, not full communication and critical thinking skills."

gnArvcWaH6I,The Youtube algorithm works in ways not comprehensible to us mere mortals
gnArvcWaH6I,trapd00rspider Mald for sure.
gnArvcWaH6I,@Count Reavyr can confirm!
gnArvcWaH6I,MushisCow ok cow
gnArvcWaH6I,@Chad Raush Perhaps you should take a look at who I responded to. I didn&#39;t respond to anybody who made a joke. I chuckled at the joke of OP. Otherwise please elaborate the punchline of who I responded to instead of being unconstructive and demeaning when it clearly looks like you didn&#39;t do your own homework before bashing me 😂
gnArvcWaH6I,Dear God people HE.IS.JOKING!!!!
gnArvcWaH6I,@Jonathan Rocha ok.
gnArvcWaH6I,"That&#39;s exactly how I treat trolls on the internet. It works really well. If somebody fiercely disagrees with you and refuses to see the obvious, simply say &quot;ok&quot; and move on."
gnArvcWaH6I,@ElFlechero you&#39;re a man of culture
gnArvcWaH6I,That&#39;s marriage material right there.
gnArvcWaH6I,Tessa Grawe thanks i was really wondering why she does that
gnArvcWaH6I,@Alex Hebi The way he is interpreting/understanding the meaning of these words are different from how you and I would interpret it - I can only assume he thinks it&#39;s longer because one stick is ahead of the other
gnArvcWaH6I,Please try to explain the stick getting moved being considered longer
gnArvcWaH6I,@Banѕhee 3.7M views is misleading. I bet most people weren&#39;t looking for a video where you tell them a kid doesn&#39;t know those things. EVERYONE knows kids don&#39;t fully understand those things. If you didn&#39;t know then you&#39;re a kid yourself.
gnArvcWaH6I,@Banѕhee yes because exactly what this video is about. They are telling us a kid is not as smart as an adult. How to correct a kid from making those stupid mistakes will be hard and interesting to watch. We already know kids dont know those kind of stuff on their own.
gnArvcWaH6I,@Banѕhee developing brain can be taught also.
gnArvcWaH6I,"Well, you were."
gnArvcWaH6I,"he&#39;s not blindly answering anything though, he&#39;s just wrong. not a good comparison"
gnArvcWaH6I,Drinker_Of_ Milk  that also doesn’t change the fact that the first Answer is taken as final whereas staying on the subject for even another few seconds could and would mostly lead to the child having another or various answers outside of the first. Nothing is set in stone
gnArvcWaH6I,"Drinker_Of_ Milk that’s a weird way to summarise what I said. It’s also wrong. It’s not for a feeling of lording but for the feeling of ha, we can understand kids  I’m not saying your wrong, cause you ain’t but there’s a lot of science revolving around Brain development.  A lot."
gnArvcWaH6I,She doesn&#39;t. She just says okay and moves on.
gnArvcWaH6I,@Radosław Brzeziński exactly!
gnArvcWaH6I,I dont think you choose biological gender
gnArvcWaH6I,"@Jane Doe he was running around the house saying he was missing a hundred dollars. I can&#39;t remember if I admitted to it or he found it, but he wasn&#39;t very happy lol"
gnArvcWaH6I,Oh no. What happened afterwards? I need to know.
gnArvcWaH6I,😂
gnArvcWaH6I,"Everywhere used to sell pints (~550mL) as the standard size of a beer. Prices crept up slowly but surely from $8 to $11 in a lot places. All of the sudden these hipster bars only sell schooners (425mL), no warning, same price, same shape/roughly same height glass. Bunch of slimey Kents."
gnArvcWaH6I,This has to be an american kid...
gnArvcWaH6I,no need to scream man
gnArvcWaH6I,Kid: Take my money
gnArvcWaH6I,You mean non-Caucasian magic.
gnArvcWaH6I,Every kid at his age does the same.
gnArvcWaH6I,"@Koals I&#39;m pretty sure his hypothesis was tested by someone(s?) else with a non verbal experiment that corroborated his initial theory, but I&#39;m also a fool so take that with a grain of salt."
gnArvcWaH6I,He&#39;ll grow up to be a topologist
gnArvcWaH6I,"As far as I know, researchers did find out later that Piagets experiments were too difficult and not clear enough for children, so yeah there might actually be some miscommunication happening here."
gnArvcWaH6I,"@minju Sure sure, that makes sense, and I agree. I think this particular video does a bad job at accounting for exogenous variables, but I feel like this video is just illustrative of the concepts, rather than striving to be fair and unbiased - if that makes sense. <br><br>Either way, thanks for sharing your view."
gnArvcWaH6I,"Thanks for sharing your perspectives, I do think it&#39;s a little of both sometimes. Like sometimes  children dont understand the meaning of what&#39;s being asked of them so they&#39;ll answer something that makes it seem like they&#39;re incapable of grasping a concept. other times they do understand and they answer incorrectly. So I definitely think its both."
gnArvcWaH6I,As I a kid I remember saying things were &quot;fair&quot; for the sake of making peace and I dont think child experiments this young are all that accurate especially because children dont have a broad vocabulary or know what the instructor is actually meaning.
gnArvcWaH6I,"@Jason Moon I&#39;ve heard that there have been lots of studies, including several non verbal experiments, that corroborate Piaget&#39;s initial hypothesis. Have you had any exposure to those papers? (I haven&#39;t, full disclosure - just regurgitating what I&#39;ve seen elsewhere, and super curious about your take.)"
gnArvcWaH6I,"@Sam Tuson right on, man. I appreciate where you&#39;re coming from.  My perspective: I&#39;ve read Piaget and I have issue with the conclusions he presents in his work. There are other videos in this series linked with his theories and I find them equally inept at representing a sound proof of their premises. It&#39;s just my opinion, and I appreciate you sharing a different one."
gnArvcWaH6I,"Actually, no. What you Say it&#39;s true only when Kids reach the next stage of development, around 6-7 yo. Any parents knows that for a kid it&#39;s Better to eat two small slices of pie than a Big One. If you ask them ti choose between a big Candy or two small ones they Will go for the small ones."
gnArvcWaH6I,That&#39;s some M. Night Shamalyn type twist
gnArvcWaH6I,"The AI took control of a human body but has zero computational skills. Surrounded by children, there is only one way to start."
gnArvcWaH6I,"The lady: “Are these play dough balls the same?”<br>The kid: “Yes”<br>The lady: ”at last, the secrets of the universe are mine”"
gnArvcWaH6I,EmotiicDevil His IQ is unparalleled to Albert Einstein
gnArvcWaH6I,@Drinker_Of_ Milk right. Thats why my comment stated that these boiled up to a question about fairness......
gnArvcWaH6I,"@your right I&#39;m sooo sorry Cheers man, I&#39;ve put the tl;dr as the first paragraph"
gnArvcWaH6I,"Andrew Micallef stopped reading half way through the first paragraph, I think everyone else did too! Sorry bud!"
gnArvcWaH6I,"&quot;i have 2 ferraris and you have 1 lada , is that fair? No.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Now you have 2 ladas and i have 2 ferraris , is that fair? Yeah , we both have 2 cars&quot;"
gnArvcWaH6I,"You can do these tests non-verbally, and tbh that&#39;s the fairest, most unbiased way to do things. Offer him 2 small candies or 1 big one, for example, and let him choose. Or show him two cups of his favourite drink, and pour one into a taller, skinnier glass, then let him choose. Apparently, these non verbal tests have been done a bunch in other studies that are fairer than this video, but obviously make for less interesting viewing."
gnArvcWaH6I,well yeah he’s a baby lol
gnArvcWaH6I,@2 beans 1 cream True
gnArvcWaH6I,"@im ani actually, he is getting tricked, because he things if it&#39;s taller it&#39;s more, like the green ball, he thought it was different because of the shape"
gnArvcWaH6I,"Yes, Precisely. 5Head wine glass"
gnArvcWaH6I,Exactly
gnArvcWaH6I,"@TXC Rag3 yes he could, he even measured with his hand the comparable height of the liquid in the container. Then again when it gets taller in comparison in the larger cup."
gnArvcWaH6I,Yuh
gnArvcWaH6I,Salt
gnArvcWaH6I,@Renni search sodium chloride its related
gnArvcWaH6I,"@BazookaAce /r/woosh, boomer"
gnArvcWaH6I,I&#39;m supposed to read that kid part with Xavier renegade angel&#39;s voice right?
gnArvcWaH6I,the point of the video is that all kids go through this stage of development before they understand conservation of mass. Piaget did studies on kids and this is pretty common
gnArvcWaH6I,"so in other words, why be smart when you can be dumb instead"
gnArvcWaH6I,I laughed so hard!
gnArvcWaH6I,"It works on adults too. Democrats have been doing it for years.<br>I have a freezer and you have a freezer. That&#39;s fair.<br>Mine cost 24k and is stocked with ice cream. But we both have freezers, so it&#39;s fair."
gnArvcWaH6I,"Actually, it should have taught you how Democrats scam you.<br>They will get you $15 an hour all the while taking 20% of that in payroll tax for themselves. Inflation will make the extra money you get not worth as much, but your getting more, right?"
gnArvcWaH6I,Lmao i cant tell if these comments are serious or not but i took years of psych and i can yell you the kid is perfectly normal
gnArvcWaH6I,@Lmao. What an embarrassment
gnArvcWaH6I,Bruh his hair is still growing 😂
gnArvcWaH6I,Because it would affect his answers

gnArvcWaH6I,"To teach you how Democrats work.<br>I get you $15 and hour and I will make millions off your payroll tax. Sure it will cause massive inflation, but your getting more, right?"
gnArvcWaH6I,@Norm T LOLIES?
gnArvcWaH6I,Exactly what I saying this will work on adults kids just don’t know how to describe things well so that’s why it looks this way
gnArvcWaH6I,"In Italy they sell a chocolate bar which is the same size of a 100 g bar, but it actually weighs 80 g because each square has a hole in the middle ._."

gnArvcWaH6I,@Tom Wanders it&#39;s just a strawman argument...
gnArvcWaH6I,As someone who had Latin in school and failed miserably at it I have no idea what you guys just said.
gnArvcWaH6I,"@Leogrooo now that&#39;s getting personal... anyways was the original comment a joke, I&#39;m still not sure."
gnArvcWaH6I,"@Leogrooo by ad populum, ad baculum even if its ad verecundiam... try that again with me, sister!🤪"
gnArvcWaH6I,@Leogrooo after I read your comment I had to check your channel to see if you were being serious or just joking.  After looking at your content I&#39;m still wondering.
gnArvcWaH6I,Yes
gnArvcWaH6I,@Danny Boy Gregory-McCormick because closed one stays fresh for longer. Duh.
gnArvcWaH6I,"@Danny Boy Gregory-McCormick- if you&#39;re talking long-life milk, though, it makes sense. Once it&#39;s opened you&#39;ll have like 4-5 days before it goes bad. Buying two smaller cartons (so that you&#39;ll have milk for 9-10 days rather than 5) is the better option in that instance - unless they want to keep returning to the shop to buy stuff multiple times per week."
gnArvcWaH6I,Wow everyone and thing is just brands to you now.
gnArvcWaH6I,"Way back when I stayed with my parents, I&#39;d come home after doing whatevs, my mother would walk into my room, look at me and ask &quot;Are you at home now?&quot;...<br><br>..."
gnArvcWaH6I,"This is the dam truth. This woman always buys 2 half cartons of milk every week, so I asked if she wanted a gallon instead since its cheeper, she&#39;s says &quot;no that&#39;s too much milk we cannot drink that much.&quot;"
gnArvcWaH6I,"@V3rb You know what, you too. Stay safe out there, mentally and physically. I hope you can get some cool projects done or read some books or movies or whatever things you&#39;ve been putting off. Take it easy."
gnArvcWaH6I,"RageXBlade You know what, have a nice day!"
gnArvcWaH6I,"@V3rb You know what, I apologize too. There&#39;s no way to judge someone&#39;s parenting potential off of a single youtube comment. (Or at least I hope there&#39;s not) My comment was totally uncalled for. I also think that the burden of making sure instructional materials like this are used properly lies entirely with the producers of that material. This channel&#39;s content should have been private, or they should have had an explanation before the main part. At the very least an explanation in the video description or with links to more information."
gnArvcWaH6I,"RageXBlade alright, that’s fair, but i still don’t quite agree. I’m sorry for lashing out like that though."
gnArvcWaH6I,"@V3rb <br>I don&#39;t get it dude, this is an established behavioral phenomenon for this age group. Explaining isn&#39;t going to really help that much. It&#39;s like trying to explain object permanence to a baby. Child brains are different than adult or adolescent brains, with good reason- they need to learn and adapt much more than adult do. Comments like yours discourage people from posting more free educational material on platforms. Putting great examples out there, especially psychology stuff that you&#39;re supposed to have education and training to understand, and then having people who clearly don&#39;t understand the methodology criticize them is not going to be productive, dude."
gnArvcWaH6I,Not in a creepy way*
gnArvcWaH6I,Oh Really I’m British and know nothing about American politics but I’m sure what you said was very funny and smart
gnArvcWaH6I,"It&#39;s to teach you how Democrats work.<br>I get you $15 and hour and I will make millions off your payroll tax. Sure it will cause massive inflation and your money won&#39;t go as far, but your getting more, right?"
gnArvcWaH6I,@Iᴅᴋ ᴀɴʏᴍᴏʀᴇ Exactly - well put
gnArvcWaH6I,"Great Briton Yep. Kids aren&#39;t that dumb, they&#39;re just impressionable and the kid is trying to understand what she wants him to reply/think. Either that or they yet to grasp what exactly makes things have &quot;more&quot; in definition. Which I bet is not hard for them to realize."
gnArvcWaH6I,"Actually in the past 70 years those experiments have been reproduced over and over, with different ways of phrasing and even without verbal questions. The result Is the same. My bad, THE SAME🤣"
gnArvcWaH6I,Yea I can see the flaw in the experiment. And also that the kid is trying to understand what she wants him to realize more than what is at hand. They&#39;re pretty impressionable
gnArvcWaH6I,Exactly

gnArvcWaH6I,@Kurfluffle thanks for the explanation!
gnArvcWaH6I,"This is a test based upon Piaget’s Stages of Development <br>The third stage of development (Concrete Operational) is being tested here. If a child has reached this stage, they will understand concepts like conversions, math, and other observational and logic based concepts. The child being tested still is in the second stage since he can’t grasp conversations yet. He can currently only see things from his perspective, and bases his thinking purely on what he sees.<br><br>Everyone goes through these stages at about roughly the same time, it’s a cool way to understand why children act the way they do!"
gnArvcWaH6I,"Janice Chen Nope! This is a stage of cognitive development that every child goes through. Children at his age are physically unable to understand abstract concepts like conversion of matter, it’s the same reason why a lot of toddlers can’t understand how others feel until they get a little older."

gnArvcWaH6I,@Deathnotefan97 the theory here is that there&#39;s no point in telling him he&#39;s wrong at this point. it won&#39;t change the fact he doesn&#39;t perceive the permanence of mass/volume/quantity. you can explain and then do another test and he&#39;ll get it wrong again.
gnArvcWaH6I,"It is a trait most people seem to lose, sadly, when they grow"
gnArvcWaH6I,"As a teacher, I will not regard his concept of “more or less” as “wrong”, it is simply a bit unconventional. If I was asked to clarify the concept of mass and conservation to him, I would simply say that is not what I mean by “more”, and try to express my concept by examples. He is very good at picking up pattern, so I believe introducing our concept of mass would be very easy"
gnArvcWaH6I,"@Colin Deal Yh but I disagree that that is what is happening here, and it’s instead experimenter bias"
gnArvcWaH6I,"If the child truely understood the abstract concepts of conservation, then the changes she makes wouldn&#39;t change his answer. That is the entire point that is trying to be illustrated here. A child of this age, according to Piaget&#39;s developmental stages, is in the preoperational stage. One of the characteristics of that stage is inability or difficulty to understand abstract concepts. The coin example is great at this because the spreading out of the coins doesn&#39;t actually change the amount despite there being an obvious change of some sort and the child can then count the number of coins in each row and find that there are the same amount using concrete concepts (5 coins is the same as 5 coins)."
gnArvcWaH6I,This is a very well studied and observed phenomenon. Do a quick Google search for Piaget&#39;s stages of cognitive development and you&#39;ll see that these types of tests have been performed with thousands of children and youth across a wide range of ages. This is simply demonstrating the normal/typical/usual response of a 5 year old (a child in the preoperational stage) which is to be unable to or have difficulty understanding abstract concepts.
gnArvcWaH6I,"@Pseudotaco Yeah, I knew I got that info from somewhere but didn&#39;t remember where"
gnArvcWaH6I,@Loljptrollergami I see you have been watching Vsauce?
gnArvcWaH6I,This is like when you ask a kid young enough which number is halfway through  1 and 9 they say 3
gnArvcWaH6I,@Goodoldmoovies True. The video quality looked to me like it was converted from VHS 90s. But considering the ratio the video has your probably right
gnArvcWaH6I,"Assuming the study took place right around when the video was published, he&#39;s actually only 13 or 14."
gnArvcWaH6I,The latter for me. 5AM specifically.

gnArvcWaH6I,"@Not Cthulhu The Child will only feel stupid if its stupidity is announced and if it is made to understand that stupid is a bad thing to be. Then the typical defence and pain kick in.<br><br>Notice the adults mannerism. This test is meant to show adults how kids are, it&#39;s a teaching implement for adults because we don&#39;t follow the same logic a child does. Notice they never state the child is wrong. They never correct it. They don&#39;t even change the tone of their voice. This is because the child is correct, in a way that makes logical sense to the child. The child will later find a new logical sense based on modern sciences, but attempting to argue it may cause developmental harm for critical thinking skills in the future.<br><br>In this nonconfrontational way, this test is fine. As it causes no effect to the child."
gnArvcWaH6I,"Plus Tommy is balding at 5yo, give this little dude a break."
gnArvcWaH6I,😂😂😂😂
gnArvcWaH6I,"@basedneet Hypothetically the child might feel stupid if the scenario were observed in any way similar to how I wrote it, or... of course... if it literally played out in the way I wrote it, which was the joke, and thus, more or less, my use of &quot;unethical&quot; wasn&#39;t literal."

gnArvcWaH6I,"@Thirbo you said cringe and hoes mad in the same sentence, sorry but this isn&#39;t 2016. You can&#39;t call anyone out for anything lol"
gnArvcWaH6I,"Yes it is a bit misleading, but if you think a kid is being mislead when you simply change the position of where something is and it replies yes there is now more of it then you&#39;re about as smart as a kid who thinks 1/2+1/2=2"

gnArvcWaH6I,Which stick is bigger?<br><br>Kid: sure the size of the stick is important but it matters a whole lot more on who is carrying it.<br><br>... um<br><br>Let me answer your question with another question. &quot;What is the stick?&quot; Or better yet &quot;why is the stick?&quot;<br><br>I&#39;m sorr-<br><br>Size is just a perception we use to justify the world we live in.

gnArvcWaH6I,"Abraham Starnes actually if anything I’m disappointed by how overwhelmed the general public is by a conversation that really is not that difficult to understand. Nor was it made for you in the first place but I guess people are entitled enough to feel like everything needs to be accessible for them. <br>So Sorry, am I using any words you don’t know?

gnArvcWaH6I,@MrHemanik i got the joke but still wanted to comment that bruh
gnArvcWaH6I,@Ninja Snapple i know
gnArvcWaH6I,"I used to pull these trucks on my older sister when I was young, what a sucker."
gnArvcWaH6I,"This has been replicated hundreds of times with a variety of phrasings and also replicated non-verbally. The words chosen are heavily scrutinised in all tasks involving children to determine it&#39;s not a confounding factor. The results hold up no matter how it&#39;s operationalized. I assure you, you aren&#39;t the first person to think of this in 70 years. Also as it&#39;s been pointed out, 5 is the age we expect children to being completing the first of these tasks correctly."
gnArvcWaH6I,Very true.
gnArvcWaH6I,"Exactly my thoughts, between the &quot;need to answer&quot; and the question itself, maybe the kid just feels he is being asked if they&#39;re &quot;different&quot; now, regardless of the actual kind of comparison. This happened to me when I started speaking and second language and later <del>to a lesser extent</del> a third one, because my mind would just lump together concepts such as &quot;more, bigger, wider, larger&quot; and &quot;less, smaller, narrower&quot; etc. And when I was asked about something in comparison, I&#39;d just answer to the thought of &quot;more length&quot; or &quot;less volume&quot; before actually reasoning what I wanted to say"
gnArvcWaH6I,"It&#39;s more because they haven&#39;t learned about the concept of volume and quantity or the distinction between them. They just see &quot;size&quot; as a end all be all measurement. This is longer, higher, must be bigger for example"
gnArvcWaH6I,"Oh yeah because just putting the glasses right next to each other would be a worse method of measuring than putting a hand, that is not perfectly horizontal, between the glasses, on a table that is probably not horizontal as well."

gnArvcWaH6I,"@zuhaib zulfiqar Makes you wonder, did he have that mentality for all the other answers?"
gnArvcWaH6I,"yeah, i noticed that too and paused the video to think about it. May be the kid was being polite, because he is not super close and intimate with the lady. Also, who knows how the lady has been to him before this experiment. <br>Anyway, it still bugs me as to was that kid lying for being polite, or did he actually believe that."

gnArvcWaH6I,"@Yo Sour do more research. I study child development. They don&#39;t know math, they don&#39;t know measurements, we learned these concepts that&#39;s why we are able to spot the difference right away.

gnArvcWaH6I,@Rebeca Sandstrom the child doesn&#39;t know the difference between the water being higher or more. Saying &#39;yes it is higher&#39; is the same as saying &#39;yes it has more water&#39;. The problem is agreeing at all.
gnArvcWaH6I,Angela Sinclair maybe he can’t understand the concept bc she’s telling him hes right when indeed he’s not if you elaborate on the question and elaborate on why he’s wrong and why guaranteed he understand in less than 3 questions and understand the concept just fine
gnArvcWaH6I,"She doesn’t say he’s right, she says his REASONING is right. She asks with the water “are they the same?” and he says no, the taller glass has more water because it’s higher. She then says “yes, it is higher.”’ She doesn’t say “yes, it has more water.”"

gnArvcWaH6I,@Im Better who&#39;s a Jew
gnArvcWaH6I,"@Анатолий К. Ok so to be honest with you I just used Einstein&#39;s example as it would be funny if someone had responded with &quot;still at the same time&quot; after the second example as that&#39;s what&#39;s happening in the experiment in the  video. As for your question, I was wondering the same thing. I don&#39;t fully understand why either but it has something to do with the speed of light being absolute. There&#39;s a great video on time dilation about this. Also, a video from Vsauce about what would happen when you would turn on your headlights traveling close to the speed of light. Another suggestion is a book called &quot;The ABC of relativity&quot;"
gnArvcWaH6I,"@Anne Hinrichs I&#39;m confused with all this time relativity. In your example with trains, isn&#39;t light is an information that travels with set speed and it just takes longer to reach you the bigger the distance, or your speed if you move away from the source from which light emmited?<br>What confuses me is when it is used to explain why time moves differently for someone moving fast and someone stationary. Like the experiment when watches tuned to the same time before experiment show different time after one of the watches was accelerated in a extremely fast moving vehicle."
gnArvcWaH6I,Thanknu everyone for taking ur time  to explain this to me lol ik imma lil slow I barley got it till that dude said time is fake but look isnt it that time is real but it depends on how fast u are going

gnArvcWaH6I,"Diandredofus of course the kid isn’t dumb. And yes there is linguistics, but there’s also a cognitive aspect. It gets more complicated in English, but lets say in French, we have simple words that defines same quantity, and still the kids aren’t able at that age to realize How « matter is conserved ». It’s like if you have 5 toy dogs and 10 other different toy animals. If you ask the kid « are dogs animals? » he’ll say yes, and then you ask how many animals there is. He’ll say 15. Then you ask if there is more dogs or more animals? And he’ll still say there’s more dog even if he understands that all 15 toys are animals. That’s the the way his brain is able to make connections and the way his cognitive abilities are developed at that point. By no means he’s Dumb."

gnArvcWaH6I,"His reasoning for ‘quantitative increase’ is also never quantitative, so it seems wrong to assume that the increase he’s talking about is quantitative rather than merely apparent."
gnArvcWaH6I,"There’s also just an ambiguity about the meaning of ‘more’. For a young kid ‘more’ is not yet a defined concept, it could mean ‘quantitatively more’ or it could mean ‘bigger’. ‘Quantitatively more’ is an unnecessarily precise meaning to expect a kid to assume by ‘more’. Once she gets him to count the coins it becomes obvious to him what sense of ‘more’ she’s interested in so he gives the ‘correct’ answer"

gnArvcWaH6I,"chloe.greynolds This experiment isn’t used to show that young kids have not developed conservation yet. If you look at Piaget’s psychological experiments, you’d understand."
gnArvcWaH6I,Ha
gnArvcWaH6I,@Blake Richard Nah not really
gnArvcWaH6I,Stimulus checks... this comment was ahead of its time
gnArvcWaH6I,Lmao
gnArvcWaH6I,"BlackyJessy it just need to set as a game without the feeling of judgment, and to so you need to encourage them even if they make mistakes, it’s hard to explain, I just developed experience to treat with them, it’s something you either have or not"
gnArvcWaH6I,"@M Thank you. As a psychology student I think it is always necessary to improve the tests and to be able to identify &quot;errors&quot; made by others, even if thoses seem not noteworthy. <br><br>I think working on the &quot;Are they the same?&quot; question could be good. Like  &quot;Have both objects the same amount of clay?&quot; Because a child would probably hesitate to say that objects with different form are just &quot;the same&quot;.<br><br>(sry for bad english)"
gnArvcWaH6I,"Yep, the kids still in early development, but his communication is excellent for his age."
gnArvcWaH6I,"Mykka Plays Games<br>the test is very real, it really demonstrate the inability to recognize spatial permutation.. what I’m saying is it is scientifically wrong to conduct a test forcing the “correct” answer.. you can find this behavior continuously in scientific fields, it is done unconsciously.. since you already know the result, you act like expecting that result, and that, (especially in a test like this, where it is involved communication, it really affect the test) I said this test is run all over the world in a biased way, expecting the results, this is not what science means"
gnArvcWaH6I,"@M &quot;I’m just saying that the test is biased, and forced to that direction, just because they know already the result that they cannot do it..&quot; <br><br>I&#39;m going to need you to clarify what is being biased in this test. Are you trying to say that the children they ran the test on were not correctly selected by a random process to ensure the integrity of the test? I&#39;m still confused as to what&#39;s biased here.<br>On top of that, you mentioned &quot;in the test you ran&quot;. If so, do you have your study posted and peer reviewed or are you just giving anecdotal evidence? I don&#39;t know how you ran your test so I have no idea how you carried out the procedure. Please state to me how the test is biased because as far as I can tell, it is not. The REASON we&#39;re testing is to confirm children around this age do not have this level of cognitive thinking. <br>To say that the age choice is biased is throwing out one of the reasons we are running this test. of course it&#39;s biased. We&#39;re testing children in this age group to determine where this cognitive skill generally develops, so we need to select from children at this age."
gnArvcWaH6I,@MultiDarkZen uh i think he was joking
gnArvcWaH6I,@Elias Abbas What part of the Bible it says that very specific phrase is in the Bible again? I mean you can say gay people will burn in hell but at least we aren&#39;t devoted to the big make believe sky daddy
gnArvcWaH6I,@(๑ゝω·)ﾉ♡ there&#39;s no need to be gay. There&#39;s no need to be straight either
gnArvcWaH6I,Yeah hello
gnArvcWaH6I,"@Al Van It shows that most children that age aren&#39;t far enough in their cognitive development to differentiate between multiple dimensions, like height and volume or amount and length. I think."
gnArvcWaH6I,My mans got really bad trust issues now 😥
gnArvcWaH6I,@DarkChan Try again! lol
gnArvcWaH6I,It&#39;s time! Haha
gnArvcWaH6I,It would be interesting to put the four pieces next to each-other and and him to pick two and see if he understood that the bigger pieces are more valuable. He might still pick the smaller pieces out of kindness tho.
gnArvcWaH6I,What?
gnArvcWaH6I,@katie  🆗😅👌
gnArvcWaH6I,Are you laughing at the flawed logic of a five year old? Jeez.
gnArvcWaH6I,"Yeah, he says &quot;it&#39;s more because you moved them appart&quot; understands what happened but not the words."
gnArvcWaH6I,@L.L Lullaby yeah it&#39;s definitely hard to transmit stuff like this to kids. I don&#39;t have all too much first hand experience with them tho. But I very much look forward to being a parent.
gnArvcWaH6I,"@21area21 you could be right, but its what i remember hearing when i took psychology and they gave a brief explanation of child development. I remember having to say the same thing different ways to my 6 year old sister and finally she would respond &quot;oh.&quot; Not sure if she actually understood it tho."
gnArvcWaH6I,"@L.L Lullaby Correct. But you are asking a specific question. The kid MIGHT be capable of understanding that no change occurred in volume/quantity but the vocabulary might not have been in introduced. It can be considered &quot;more&quot; if the definitions aren&#39;t more solidly stated. Which is more? 5 cows or 6 mice?<br><br>For instance, the child could answer either way. Or they may get frustrated because subconsciously there is a conflict. I know the whole point is that you&#39;re trying to show that kids can&#39;t understand these concepts, but I think the words are a limitation here."
gnArvcWaH6I,"Child psychology. Their brains are not fully developed so they dont fully understand liquid, mass, matter, or even time and space."
gnArvcWaH6I,"@David Eaton [Read In Hippy Voice] Whoa ddduueee thats like, ssoooo trippy man. Like -- e can perceive it being destoryed... Radical! Ima get my bong and see what kinda of theories i can cook up tonight too!"
gnArvcWaH6I,x what about it?
gnArvcWaH6I,Okko Heiniö this should go in the comments hall of fame and should be proudly displayed to anyone who acts like a know it all!! Incredible!
gnArvcWaH6I,LOL
gnArvcWaH6I,@Igor Modolo Yes. Im just here to laugh of the stupid replies though.
gnArvcWaH6I,@Cyanide Hes a fool thats why
gnArvcWaH6I,🤣🤣🤣🤣savage
gnArvcWaH6I,Rofl
gnArvcWaH6I,I&#39;m dedz now... Thanks to you I cannot stop laughing~
gnArvcWaH6I,Dont worry he will get the ability to tell that they are the same when he grows up and is shown the same test
gnArvcWaH6I,sorry mister i watch rick and morty
gnArvcWaH6I,The child just need to recognize patterns
gnArvcWaH6I,And rocking a comb over
gnArvcWaH6I,"So, did you pass?...lol"
gnArvcWaH6I,And the child is clearly and fairly confident because of it.
gnArvcWaH6I,"It makes the child timid. Whenever you want to make a child learn, let him learn through his own trials and errors, it boost his self respect and makes him/her confident. That&#39;s what they taught us in teaching courses."
gnArvcWaH6I,"@Undead WalUwUgi ikr, too bad I grew up and developed a conscience. 😂"
gnArvcWaH6I,@E L you should have pursued a professional career in con artistry
gnArvcWaH6I,"@Nils Blumental When I was in first or second grade, I found some lime stones and painted them gold, told classmates they were gold nuggets and started selling them for real money. Needless to say when a teacher found out, I got in a whole lot of trouble. 😂"
gnArvcWaH6I,"@Gracey Shaw In Kindergarten I convinced another kid to trade his small coin with more value for my big one with less value. We found them in the playgrounds sand. And no, I haven&#39;t turned out as a manipulative scam artist genius yet :-/"
gnArvcWaH6I,@Gracey Shaw 😂😂😂😂😂😂
gnArvcWaH6I,telling truth might not be as easy as it sounds but you did it easily.
gnArvcWaH6I,🤣🤣🤣🤣

gnArvcWaH6I,Yeah I could see how he thought that was &quot;fair&quot;. Children get smaller portions.
gnArvcWaH6I,i get four
gnArvcWaH6I,Snappy Dragon that’s the whole point of this test. It’s to teach cause and effect and it lets the child make decisions based one what he saw and the questions that are being asked.
gnArvcWaH6I,@guy His reasons are wrong to her answers. He&#39;s just explaining what is happening after she manipulates the objects.
gnArvcWaH6I,"The reasoning is right, the language game is wrong. He intuits exactly what happened, she’s just confusing him with the words. I think ending with “or are they the same” biases this response."
gnArvcWaH6I,Sky Luke I dont know what you&#39;re saying. Are you saying that adults take linguistic shortcuts? I made more than one comment here for starters
gnArvcWaH6I,"@Francis Luglio i could say the same for you as well as most people in the US. Have you ever seen a rep and democrat argue about guns and abortion rights, as if its the same law???"

gnArvcWaH6I,💀💀💀🤣🤣🤣
gnArvcWaH6I,...<br>Wtf am I saying.<br>I sound like I&#39;m high.
gnArvcWaH6I,"I never thought of myself as smart because I noticed I made illogical assumptions all the time. Like words in my head not matching my intuition.<br>I couldn&#39;t really explain or articulate how I understood something, so I thought my mind was randomly guessing stuff. Rather, it seems like my mind was not fully develop to understand certain concepts."
gnArvcWaH6I,At this age kids can&#39;t comprehend this things. Most adults are no better.
gnArvcWaH6I,Of...what?
gnArvcWaH6I,"Comment  and the replies made me cringe hard, I hope we have evolved from this unfunny/overused joke"

gnArvcWaH6I,Ikr
gnArvcWaH6I,@Marc Sv01 hell I know highschool students who still struggle with volume and mass...
gnArvcWaH6I,He was mistaking bigger for wider/taller. They don&#39;t understand what volume or mass is yet.

gnArvcWaH6I,Girl i didnt know you was running for president
gnArvcWaH6I,My AP Psych exam was last year and I still feel this
gnArvcWaH6I,It’s litterally 2 am and this was supposed to be my last video. Youtube ganna throw a wild card to keep me on the app another hour
gnArvcWaH6I,it&#39;s 3.30am
gnArvcWaH6I,Haha I watched it from bed
gnArvcWaH6I,"This same exact video was in my exam, so thanks youtube =D"
gnArvcWaH6I,I&#39;m laughing out loud to this comment bc it is SO true!!
gnArvcWaH6I,"WTF, I watched this a year ago!? I have no recollection of this video nor do I understand why I posted that"
gnArvcWaH6I,"adonisds bro chill they’re just asking him to see his cognitive and reasoning development to compare w his age, and on top of this she’s speaking to him in a neutral tone."
gnArvcWaH6I,Feathers. Meat is expensive these days.
gnArvcWaH6I,"@K J  wow u are a genius, i didnt know that"

gnArvcWaH6I,"Usually begins around 10 yrs old but it&#39;s not a &quot;one step&quot; thing.  It&#39;s a continuous progress that even extends well into adulthood (i.e. realizing the reality of relationships in real life vs. what is depicted in movies/books, etc.)"
gnArvcWaH6I,"I too remember my time at uni (Harvard) as a young lad of 6 years, fresh off the SAT with my, of course, perfect score. A peculiar thing happened on my bus ride over to the campus though. I recall biding my time solving some simple calculus (in my head, naturally) when suddenly everyone aboard the bus began to roar in applause. Without noticing it I had solved world hunger by separating a Snickers into two halves, accidently creating an endless supply of food for the starving. As suddenly as the applause began, a man approached me in congratulation, that mans name? Barack Obama."
gnArvcWaH6I,@Dan Schmidt i just made an observation.
gnArvcWaH6I,Anakin Lumluk 😂
gnArvcWaH6I,"You should be proud of yourself, really."
gnArvcWaH6I,"It isn&#39;t supposed to improve anything, it&#39;s just testing the level of thinking children have."
gnArvcWaH6I,@R. yeah sure .. -_-
gnArvcWaH6I,Sir im calling with the IRS you will have to pay iq taxes with iTunes gift cards
gnArvcWaH6I,Jadeikens and then everyone clapped
gnArvcWaH6I,"kpop trash_101 I’m sure you did great 🙂 remember, you can fail the MC and get a D on the FRQs and still get a 3"
gnArvcWaH6I,@Madison Arias Welp I just took my ap psycholgy exam and I don&#39;t really want to get my hopes up😕
gnArvcWaH6I,Oh shit is this a thing? Im watching this at 2:11 am
gnArvcWaH6I,I could prolly trade that kid some nickles for his dimes
gnArvcWaH6I,Same thing the government does with all the little taxes. They take a little here little there and leave you with half. Oldest trick in the book
gnArvcWaH6I,"I think you&#39;re onto something, just listen to that self-satisfied &quot;yes!&quot; at the end"
gnArvcWaH6I,that&#39;s exactly what I said
gnArvcWaH6I,We have these wierd banking packages that work like magic tricks.
gnArvcWaH6I,"Tiago in order to know that, you would have had to. XD"
gnArvcWaH6I,@Elias Josephsson I didn&#39;t use any
gnArvcWaH6I,Tiago maby you used the wrong part of it.
gnArvcWaH6I,So accurate
gnArvcWaH6I,James Wilson factual
gnArvcWaH6I,rabbitcreative u sound like shakespeare
gnArvcWaH6I,"Hes not incorrect, hes reason is not trained yet so he answers the way he can perceive, which is from his emotions, so you have to observe it from a context of emotions. If you can be honest to yourself without thinking (without using reasonable perception), you would answer the same. It really does &quot;feel&quot; like there is more water in the taller glass ect.  <br>Keep in mind that people (adult and youth) who observe it with reason are not &quot;smarter&quot; or more right than this kid from the video. There cannot be the same amount of liquid in two different glasses, you can measure it to a certain extent, but again if we are honest to ourselves, we know that the smaller the measurement  scale we use, the closer we are to the realization that there will always be &quot;a bit more&quot; in one of the glasses.  So the statement that they are the same is not and cannot be absolutely true. Absolute truth is something out of our ordinary life, and in order to speak of it without misunderstandings we need context. <br>Absolute truth can be realized with possibility of synchronized perception of the emotions and reason, trough the movement of the body. A very rare sight in modern humans."
gnArvcWaH6I,"Because a child&#39;s nervous-system, nor a child&#39;s personal-standard-of-evaluation, is fully-developed. See: General-Semantics."

gnArvcWaH6I,"Ours say _Pint on the side. The beer must be at the line, the head is above the line."
gnArvcWaH6I,😂😂
gnArvcWaH6I,"Yes. And yes. <br>I feel like even if she just dropoed the hint some kids would get it. <br>Only saying “not how long the row, but what QUANTITY, what amount of coins, what number”"
gnArvcWaH6I,Capitalist? What other view of the world would you use.
gnArvcWaH6I,@Amanda <br>Yeah. I had the same IQ as him when I wrote that comment.
gnArvcWaH6I,His IQ is not low. His cognitive development is excatly where it should be for his age. I am super impressed with his language skills though. He articulates so well!
gnArvcWaH6I,GDI glad we figured it out like civil people. This is what the internet is for. Intellectual debate.
gnArvcWaH6I,@Not in Gb Agreed
gnArvcWaH6I,"@Zuzanna Kuklińska it would be interesting, if they make the same test with nonfood. Think there would be always a diffrent answer."
gnArvcWaH6I,"exactly the logic! actually i think he might have thought something like that. kids often discribe themselves as &quot;small&quot; and adults as &quot;big&quot; and usually they are fed smaller amounts so the kid could be just used to getting less food and accepting it as &quot;fair&quot;, meaning, &quot;thats how the world works!&quot;. So thats why at the beginning when he got one piece and she got two, he was like &quot;yes thats fair&quot;.<br>but yeah later when she broke the piece and he found it the same as her pieces is false logic :)"
gnArvcWaH6I,Jdnof Legend bahahahahahaaa good one lol 😂
gnArvcWaH6I,Suddenly became an animé 😂😂
gnArvcWaH6I,"I did think when he initially said it was fair, that his rationale would be because she’s bigger"
gnArvcWaH6I,That kid got completely DESTROYED with LOGIC.
gnArvcWaH6I,Hahahhha I wouldn’t be surprised if Karl answer a couple of questions like this kid and stuck with it lll
gnArvcWaH6I,Haha doesn&#39;t work with my sister.
gnArvcWaH6I,Lol when we were little I&#39;d give myself like a bowl full of chips and give my sister the rest (so like almost none) and say you have the whole thing while I just get a bowl you have more
gnArvcWaH6I,My sister complained our brother had more chips than she. He smashed her chips and said now you have more. She let out a howl.
gnArvcWaH6I,"Too late little one,too late"
gnArvcWaH6I,+1
gnArvcWaH6I,He’ll live a life of scam after scam.
gnArvcWaH6I,Comes with age.. more practice on each subject everyday will help a child connect the dots at a later stage... normally concrete type of thinking starts at around 7 years
gnArvcWaH6I,"She probably doesn&#39;t teach him. It&#39;s pretty normal for children of that age to think like this, and that&#39;s what this video is trying to show."
gnArvcWaH6I,What in the ever-living-shit are you talking about.
gnArvcWaH6I,Heeheehee my party smart other party dumb heeheehee
gnArvcWaH6I,That&#39;s what it seemed like to me.
gnArvcWaH6I,"Would be funnier if you said “we know how long it is, but we beeded to see how tall it is”"
gnArvcWaH6I,"@ƒire. What he does to compare the level of water is not important. The important thing is that from a previous set of rules (higher level means more water) he can set an experiment and logically get to a conclusion (that there is more water in one of the glasses), which is the core of mathematics and science."
gnArvcWaH6I,"Or, just hear me out, he could have put the glasses right next to each other to get a more accurate reading. <br><br>Nothing about this video makes him exceptional."
gnArvcWaH6I,Because they see that our politicians are doing the same thing the woman did as last test?
gnArvcWaH6I,Very well put. But women are like that. They play mind games with you. Even when you are 3 years old.
gnArvcWaH6I,"Reptiloid Till just seems to me that we’re using kids as pawns in some messed up, sick, twisted game."
gnArvcWaH6I,This isn&#39;t educational for the kid. That experiment is just done to show the viewer (us) a psychological concept
gnArvcWaH6I,You missinterpreted the intent of the video. Its isn&#39;t about the child but about a basic psychological effect.
gnArvcWaH6I,@Pablo Bolognesi oh okay. <br>i think they should have phrased it as &quot;the same amount&quot; so there isn&#39;t any confusion.
gnArvcWaH6I,@ghidfg That kind of reasoning is what these tests are all about. The interpretation of the language and the cognitive grasp of the physical world go hand in hand
gnArvcWaH6I,@Pablo Bolognesi I would eliminate the other two options as neither has more quarters.
gnArvcWaH6I,@ghidfg and why?
gnArvcWaH6I,@Pablo Bolognesi the same
gnArvcWaH6I,@TheRockindio It gives them more time in daylight instead of them having as many kids go to school in the dark and having shops closing while it&#39;s still bright out.
gnArvcWaH6I,Believe me I came here last summer and I found Day light saving most idiotic thing ever.
gnArvcWaH6I,"@Arnav RawatThe astronomer George Hudson came up with DST, not Einstein, the theoretical physicist."
gnArvcWaH6I,Daylight saving time was invented by Einstein.<br>It was not about your personal routine rather than the offical one ?
gnArvcWaH6I,@Christopher Garcés 😄
gnArvcWaH6I,@Colin Weaver 😄
gnArvcWaH6I,Yep
gnArvcWaH6I,Timothy Nemchuk lmao it’s a psychology thinf
gnArvcWaH6I,😂 Saaaaaame.
gnArvcWaH6I,@VitalHonet98 exactly this child couldn&#39;t understand that items conserve mass and don&#39;t go up or down in terms of weight or volume. Any child that could would be more intelligent than average
gnArvcWaH6I,"@Jai I&#39;m guessing that the answer was no. At least for this one, I&#39;m sure there were others who were better at it"
gnArvcWaH6I,This is a test to see if a child at early development can understand conservation and volume
gnArvcWaH6I,"That was the one that surprised me the most. The water one makes sense, all his life a glass with water that goes higher means more water. <br><br>But the teo sticks? Dude she just moved it a bit lol. I think he just looks for the end at the right: the one that gets farther to the right is longer, no matter where it starts on the left."
gnArvcWaH6I,His angle has nothing to do with it. His level of intelligence has nothing to do with it.  Only his level of development has anything to do with this
gnArvcWaH6I,That is the point of the test. A child that can understand the proper use of more at that age would be gifted.
gnArvcWaH6I,The point of the test was to make sure I&#39;d the child understood volume and that means this test is perfectly valid
gnArvcWaH6I,"There’s a ton of dummies out there. I think it’s lack of curiosity or patience more than anything else. If you care about the answer, you actually think about it. <br><br>When I was a kid I was told I had musical talent. The way I saw it, other moronic kids were just happy to spew nonsense, and I actually cared about it. There’s no talent. So, when hearing something and having to play it back, I actually listened to see if I was copying it right. Instead of just playing nonsense and asking someone else if I got it right. <br><br>Sorry for the overshare, I just felt identified with your comment."
gnArvcWaH6I,theonlycatonice this comment is a gem
gnArvcWaH6I,Zactly
gnArvcWaH6I,Yoooooo
gnArvcWaH6I,But is it (Colorized) though?<br>Asking for a friend
gnArvcWaH6I,"@Not in Gb I&#39;m not referring to this one specific child, my comment is in reference to the skill he lacks, an understanding of permanent attributes of objects."
gnArvcWaH6I,He didn’t develop any skill.
gnArvcWaH6I,Probably get the same results
gnArvcWaH6I,He is actually a very intelligent child his ability to not only communicate but also to fully express why he thinks what he does is very impressive for a child his age
gnArvcWaH6I,The kid is not stupid at 4 years old he has not developed enough to understand the concept of volume. <br>You would probably answer the same at that age.
gnArvcWaH6I,"They&#39;re not teaching here, just testing.<br>Teaching would invalidate the experiment."

gnArvcWaH6I,Steve R. Neill cool story steve
gnArvcWaH6I,@PsyQoBoy I was thinking US currency but that counts too
gnArvcWaH6I,@Miller H yea you&#39;re right though it&#39;s more expensive to make that amount or 5 cent coins.
gnArvcWaH6I,"@Miller H lol you haven&#39;t seen a $2 coin? <a href=""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_two_dollar_coin"">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_two_dollar_coin</a>"
gnArvcWaH6I,Probably the 5 centers because $2 coins don&#39;t exist.
gnArvcWaH6I,"@- Of course, Robots are built as an attempt to mimick life and man Is not yet able to do it as good as nature can. <br>But i digress, was&#39;t trying to shit on the kid&#39;s abilities or progress. I just believe this kid to be average for his age and was wandering if average kids at that age are able to comprehend the concept of volume or if it&#39;s useless to try and explain it."
gnArvcWaH6I,"probably not<br>but atleast he figured out Speech, Walking and roughly knowing when Shit hits the Fan<br>something the best Robots currently can&#39;t do"
gnArvcWaH6I,Jorhan Stahl CO-STANZA!
gnArvcWaH6I,I more or less think that he doesn&#39;t understand some Concepts<br>we know that the Glasses contain the same Amount of Water (actually they don&#39;t because Quantum Mechanics)<br>the Kid doesn&#39;t know that<br>his thinking goes<br>higher Glass = more Volume<br>Stick starts earlier = Stick is longer
gnArvcWaH6I,"@John Jordan You still don&#39;t understand, ironically. Humans develop mentally over time as we mature. When we are born, we can&#39;t do math or understand object permanence. There are developmental milestones that we reach as certain age ranges that allow us to understand more."
gnArvcWaH6I,@GDI Are you sure about that though? Can&#39;t you just teach them what criteria actually determines suchs of lenght and volume
gnArvcWaH6I,You all must be fun at parties considering how many of you didn’t get the joke 😂
gnArvcWaH6I,"They may remember it short term, but the concept will go away."
gnArvcWaH6I,@Boy lmao
gnArvcWaH6I,F
gnArvcWaH6I,"Well yeah, everything else is banned, censored or age restricted."
gnArvcWaH6I,"if the researcher told him what “more” means or doesn’t mean, then it would skew the results. this test was specifically designed to see the child’s reasoning skills and ideas of conservation based on his age."
gnArvcWaH6I,B.F. Skinner the last one proves your point wrong
gnArvcWaH6I,@Wings of KFC yeah a body language expert who works for the fbi with the name wings of kfc is here on youtube commenting about how the kid is feeling like it&#39;s some accomplishment. Everyone knows that kid wanted to say no....
gnArvcWaH6I,shaking head is no<br>nodding is yes
gnArvcWaH6I,The boy clearly says &#39;no&#39; with his head. (And note- I am an Indian)
gnArvcWaH6I,@Agnaye Ochani <br>Like whoa....
gnArvcWaH6I,Hmmm lmfaooo wtf man
gnArvcWaH6I,Something obviously went horribly wrong.
gnArvcWaH6I,"Jai no, it wouldn’t"
gnArvcWaH6I,It would be easy to scam any kid
gnArvcWaH6I,FBI is at your door for exposing the truth
gnArvcWaH6I,Giovanni Caravez that second one is Kohl’s all day
gnArvcWaH6I,Giovanni Caravez like a&amp;w’s 1/3 pound burger
gnArvcWaH6I,"19.99 is always non-negotiable, So They did their maths and pulled a smokescreen. We parked our car, took a trolley and entered a room. That&#39;s when it all started: the non-negotiable business ."
gnArvcWaH6I,Whats heavier 1kg iron or 1kg feathers ?
gnArvcWaH6I,@Paula Smallwoodthis isn&#39;t about education and learning. It&#39;s a experiment... You don&#39;t seem to get what they try to do here.
gnArvcWaH6I,"You do not come straight out and say &quot;no, you are wrong&quot; to a young child. That crushes their confidence and makes them afraid to try. You gently guide them in the right direction so that they will figure out the correct answer. Plus, this is the stage of development he is at and he will eventually figure it out on his own as he develops and is guided.  You learn all this in early childhood classes. Early Childhood educator here."
gnArvcWaH6I,That&#39;s how all of there experiments work. Not only for children but adults too.
gnArvcWaH6I,"Technically he&#39;s around 12, 13, or 14 now"
gnArvcWaH6I,Would love to see him try this experiment again haha
gnArvcWaH6I,Ever unplugged your brothers controller out of player 2 so you can secretly play for him ? 😂
gnArvcWaH6I,That’s ok. We all been there :)
gnArvcWaH6I,From his perspective it appears to reach further to the edge of the table which in his mind means longer. (I Think)
gnArvcWaH6I,passerell I didn&#39;t say those things happened in the video. <br><br>I really fear you&#39;re grasping at straws and not getting anywhere.
gnArvcWaH6I,"Halby G you said you like seeing kids learn little things, and humans communicating. <br>None of these things happen in the video. The girl does not tell the kid why he is wrong or even the fact that he is wrong."
gnArvcWaH6I,"passerell I was talking about the ability to teach and communicate. <br><br>And I wasn&#39;t babbling, unless you don&#39;t understand some of the words I was using, or you don&#39;t know what babble means. It&#39;s in the bible if you wish to look it up."
gnArvcWaH6I,Halby G you were the one babling about teaching and comunicating.
gnArvcWaH6I,"passerell I don&#39;t think the point was really to tech him, it was to explore what he knew."
gnArvcWaH6I,No
gnArvcWaH6I,@AyeAye Kane yes
gnArvcWaH6I,no
gnArvcWaH6I,@Jai get help jai
gnArvcWaH6I,"I&#39;m intensely angered at how dumb you think this child is. This child can communicate his ideas well, and form logical solutions to his best ability to support those claims. A child at age 4 could not have understood the concepts of conservation and volume that aw being demonstrated in this test."
gnArvcWaH6I,"He doesn’t understand the question because he does not have the concept of “quantity”. <br>Quantity doesnt care of shape, distribution, etc. <br><br>What he lacks is the logical step to think “if nothing was substracted or added, it must be the same, even if my visual intuition says otherwise”."
gnArvcWaH6I,Zebratje Don’t let it haunt you. That was sooooo long ago. That teacher probably went to heaven already.
gnArvcWaH6I,@moi2833 very interesting. Never heard about it before
gnArvcWaH6I,wubs23 literally what i was thinking sksksk
gnArvcWaH6I,look up the Asch conformity experiment.
gnArvcWaH6I,"Masuka ah, I see, thank you 😊"
gnArvcWaH6I,Kimmy wimmy That’s not the point of the test :)
gnArvcWaH6I,I would have been the hero german guy saving all the jews too.
gnArvcWaH6I,You&#39;re just not trying hard enough.
gnArvcWaH6I,To keep change relevant
gnArvcWaH6I,@Rico Saavy What do you mean man? What series are you talking about sorry
gnArvcWaH6I,Yes. At any store where things are sold.
gnArvcWaH6I,"You do not correct during a study. Plus, this is a stage in development for young children. At that age children think like that. This video is to show you Piaget&#39;s conservation theory to prove its right. She is not teaching him incorrect concepts. That is how children his age think."
gnArvcWaH6I,Skinny Pete you’re not very smart are you? All the girl is doing is respecting the subjects answers. You would contaminate the sample by correcting it.
gnArvcWaH6I,Telling him he’s wrong would have the same effect as telling him he’s right in influencing his decisions.
gnArvcWaH6I,That&#39;s not how experiments work...
gnArvcWaH6I,My dad said the same. My granddad said he wanted a 20lb box of $20 bills. Lol
gnArvcWaH6I,Metal Videos nice lack of sarcam detection
gnArvcWaH6I,I hope you are being sarcastic
gnArvcWaH6I,@Paul Foss Now that&#39;s an educational answer! Thanx
gnArvcWaH6I,"M17 It&#39;s demonstrating human perceptions at an early developmental phase. The child could probably have been convinced of the right answers by an adult, but this is just to help people dealing with kids at that age get a better idea of what is actually going on in their heads when they say and do the nonsense kids are known for. It&#39;s difficult to teach people things if you don&#39;t understand how they perceive the world."
gnArvcWaH6I,"He uses his visual intuition still. <br><br>He hasnt grasp the logical step of “if no water was substracted or added, then no matter what my eyes see it must be the same amount”. <br><br>But yeah I thought thatwas pretty cool too"
gnArvcWaH6I,Benjamin...
gnArvcWaH6I,Commies would have taken all the cookies
gnArvcWaH6I,Tiernan Astronskas omg CHILL she needed to encourage him to answer. his development won’t be hindered by a woman telling him good job and being friendly
gnArvcWaH6I,@Tiernan Astronskas <br><br>You would not correct a 8 month old baby who&#39;s crawling for not walking. That is because they have not physical development to that stage. It is a normal process. They wouldn&#39;t understand.<br>This is the normal process of cognitive development. You cannot rush concepts. The brain must be ready to &quot;walk&quot; itself!
gnArvcWaH6I,"Tiernan Astronskas She did give him a chance to change his answer though, but he still stuck with his logic in the following questions. I don’t think it affects his answers though. I’ve done this experiment a lot of times (not giving feedback during the test) and they all answer the same anyway. They eventually learn just like with everything else. I bet you don’t still believe in Santa despite being told a bunch of times that he exists. Even if she did ”lie” to him it’s not that big of a deal :) In any case I think this is a shitty test - but for other reasons."
gnArvcWaH6I,"Metal Videos She’s not teaching him. It’s a test that is meant to educate ADULTS about how kids that age think :) So that we understand how their mind develops. If she taught him during the test, well, that would be a failed test. We wouldn’t learn anything from that."
gnArvcWaH6I,And that&#39;s how he will never learn the difference. Bad teacher
gnArvcWaH6I,Unplug. Plug out?
gnArvcWaH6I,😂😂😂I did this to my younger brother when we used to play
gnArvcWaH6I,"Omg, i was not the only one doing that? haha"
gnArvcWaH6I,@L O You need a hug
gnArvcWaH6I,@GDI you need a hug
gnArvcWaH6I,You missed the whole point didn’t you.
gnArvcWaH6I,"@Maiahi thats why i said perhaps...am not saying what am saying as true..but then again, one study can conclude all previous study as false, as it happened in the case of coconut consumption."
gnArvcWaH6I,"You&#39;re making this assumption on this one video, while the scientists have done countless trials?"
gnArvcWaH6I,The opposite
gnArvcWaH6I,"Jiro Conwi Personally I feel that there are other problems with the test. This however, isn’t one, in my opinion at least. What the interviewer wants is a feel of what a normal child of that age can understand. They all answer the same - that’s why it’s interesting. This kid answers the same as any other kid his age (go watch any other video like this and you’ll see) :) You might think it’s because she leads him in that direction, but she does help him a bit in the first test. So he did get a chance to correct himself. <br><br>You’re talking about the fact that she doesn’t give him a chance to question his own statements (if I understand you correctly). But she does ask him in the first test a second time, after they’ve counted, and then he changes his answer. So he does grasp that it CAN be the same. But he still goes back to what’s logical to him - because at that stage in his development, that’s what makes sense (according to Piaget at least). There are similar tests with younger children. If you, for example show a two year old (not sure about the age though) an object that is hidden to yourself - then the child will think that you can see it too. Again, it’s not about what is correct or not - it’s about what the child observed. So that we can learn how to approach children in, for instance, school. <br><br>Sorry for my English 😄"
gnArvcWaH6I,"@John Smith Well you just said it&#39;s for the adults or for the test, i just said that it influenced the kids answer for future outcomes therefore being concerned on the credibility of the test but now your argument goes back to the welfare of the kid."
gnArvcWaH6I,"Jiro Conwi He did good though. It’s not about answering correctly - it’s about sharing his observations. This is a very normal experiment and it does not harm his thinking. Kids learn eventually. I mean, even if you tell kids that Santa is real they eventually figure it out you know. It doesn’t harm their logical thinking."
gnArvcWaH6I,@John Smith But they have influenced the answers of the kid for future outcomes by saying side comments like &#39;right&#39; and &#39;great&#39;.
gnArvcWaH6I,Jiro Conwi The point of the test isn’t for the kid to learn - but for adults to learn. If she taught him then the test would fail. They often show this test to people who study the developmental stages of children.
gnArvcWaH6I,"No, it&#39;s just the name for this Psychological test.  Someone named Dr. Piaget came up with this method of testing."
gnArvcWaH6I,I love his enthusiasm and confidence when he says “the saaame”. What a lovely guy.
gnArvcWaH6I,"@GDI Unfortunately, they were correct about you."
gnArvcWaH6I,@Visual Studios An accusation is nothing. You&#39;re pretending you matter
gnArvcWaH6I,"@GDI Some definitely are, and those usually don&#39;t try. You tried, and got called out for it. Just take it like a man and move on. You are not as smart as you think, but that&#39;s normal. Don&#39;t beat yourself too hard for it, happens to most people."
gnArvcWaH6I,@Visual Studios That&#39;s just it. Your attempt to portray someone as &quot;trying&quot; to sound smart is your projection. Some people are just smart and do not have to &quot;try&quot;.
gnArvcWaH6I,"@GDI Lazy? Sure. Insecure? Nope. I can call someone trying to sound smart for what he is, that has zero bearing on my intelligence or how secure I am with it."
gnArvcWaH6I,@Unapol Ridlow Ok thanks
gnArvcWaH6I,"It&#39;s not testing anything, it&#39;s demonstrating a concept that states young children haven&#39;t yet made connections between size/amount and changes.<br><br>He sees the water in two same sizes glasses, so they&#39;re the same. But then he sees the water in a bigger glass and therefore there is more water<br><br>Same with the playdough. When she smooshed it, it didn&#39;t look the same and was &quot;smaller&quot;, so therefore because it was now smaller it had less playdough."
gnArvcWaH6I,😂😂😂😂
gnArvcWaH6I,I have heard so many adults say this while working in pizzerias. Haha.
gnArvcWaH6I,I remember adults actually making that mistake...
gnArvcWaH6I,"@edgajam indeed, we understand that the failings of children&#39;s intelligence are incorrect, but our subconscious minds still fall for the same tricks."
gnArvcWaH6I,You should be awarded a Nobel Prize  for solving the famine problem
gnArvcWaH6I,How can you call him an idiot. He&#39;s just a young kid he&#39;s just trying to win numbers and understanding things like that he still has a lot to learn
gnArvcWaH6I,Obi-Wan Kenobi the point of this test is the development of abstract understanding of mathematical concepts.  At about age 7 kids understand that just changing shape doesn’t change mass or volume. It is a stage of development that was Piaget’s point
gnArvcWaH6I,"That’s not weird at all, since that’s exactly the age he should be accounting for how many years have passed. <br><br>What would be weird would be if he still was 3 years old now. THAT would be weird to think about."
gnArvcWaH6I,Yeah? Or is he 6.25x2?
gnArvcWaH6I,@Stu McDonald or i guess the smaller fatter can and the taller slimmer can
gnArvcWaH6I,"GDI if you claim rights aren’t rights if they can be taken away, you are implicitly recognising the existence of at least some rights. i am interested, what would you define as a right?"
gnArvcWaH6I,"This thread has a deepness to it, full of societal moral questions, yet is simultaneously about absolutely nothing."
gnArvcWaH6I,@TheFleeingPhoenix toddlers have more little stomachs. Thats it. Nobody is dehumanizing them so stop acting like they do.
gnArvcWaH6I,"@Andrea Call No, its the same as walking away during a conversation. Its childish."
gnArvcWaH6I,Agreeing to disagree is what mature adults do when they see that an argument is pointless.
gnArvcWaH6I,"He&#39;s a toddler, so of course"
gnArvcWaH6I,That’s exactly what I was thinking when watching this! (I’m an awful person)
gnArvcWaH6I,"@Not in Gb I think through trial and error they would realize it eventually on their own as their brains develop, just like babies eventually gain object permanence. In the mean time, they need a little help 😂😂"
gnArvcWaH6I,"That’s fascinating that they collectively said “it must be 9”. I wonder if left alone when would they realise these things, without being taught. I guess pretty fast anyways."
gnArvcWaH6I,"They are. The &quot;this kid is dumb&quot; comments are disturbing. Kids need to be taught logic, they don&#39;t automatically understand it at a certain age."
gnArvcWaH6I,Who drink a half pint
gnArvcWaH6I,Hes right but not totally. The demonstration that the two had the same volume before the transfer is the difference. Generally people perceive taller glasses to be more full.
gnArvcWaH6I,The real reason is it stops you from dumping it all over yourself
gnArvcWaH6I,"@Da Drumma Hahahahahaha<br>Ohhh man, now I&#39;ve got in my head the small kid on top of some stilts or something from bojack horseman trying to comment on youtube"

gnArvcWaH6I,"Even if they would explain it to him  he wouldn&#39;t be able to understand it, because he has not developed to that point yet."
gnArvcWaH6I,probably the same

gnArvcWaH6I,"Wow! Do ppl really expect to get a sensible answer online. I don&#39;t expect to get one with this comment. You said this, and I said that, and this is why your wrong, and I&#39;m right. Jebus I though the internet has been around long enough to know it&#39;s a place largely void of accountability. If I&#39;m not accountable for the things I say then why would I care what you have to say or whether you believe it. (Pressure on for a witty reply)<br><br> Well here i go: it&#39;s a 3.49min vid, obviously of a much longer experiment. Who knows what controls and baselines they used. I thought it was a cool upload... Not that I care what u think; wait maybe I do?"
gnArvcWaH6I,"Wandering Bishop its also just tricky language. For example, the stick didnt change shape of size but it moved and covered more distance. The questions are broad and the ladies language is nebulous and kinda tricky"
gnArvcWaH6I,"Also I feel like the education system has trained him to try to please teachers/adults by answering their questions with what they seem to expect, rather than internalizing their questions and thinking for himself.."
gnArvcWaH6I,He&#39;ll make a fine Democrat someday.
gnArvcWaH6I,Wandering Bishop best comment I’ve seen so far. And I scrolled across some complete idiots 🤦🏾‍♀️💆🏾‍♀️
gnArvcWaH6I,"Yea absolutely!  This is what Piaget&#39;s whole point, we think children are miniature form of adult and children are less intellectual. But point is their process of thinking is different that is why they differ from adults"
gnArvcWaH6I,@Lot Vanity Official why you no speak good
gnArvcWaH6I,"He got every single one wrong, if failing is doing good then yeah he&#39;s doing great"
gnArvcWaH6I,Oooooooh yeah sooo smart. Wooow!
gnArvcWaH6I,Munch Hecks I was actually suprised when he did that considering his age
gnArvcWaH6I,All kids go through a similar phase. Some end it earlier - at 4-5 are already capable of answering some of these correctly - some end it later - still make errors as teenagers/adults. But we all had a similar thought process at one point.
gnArvcWaH6I,"@Jeff Crowell oh, fun! got to try that too!"
gnArvcWaH6I,@JBroMCMXCI Only 40 minutes in the wardrobe? You may as well be a hippie. My son would receive three lashings and a night in the nailbed if he ever dared ask for more food
gnArvcWaH6I,If your kid demands more cookies you should discipline him by smacking him or locking him inside a wardrobe for 40 minutes a time. DO NOT give in to him - you are the parent!
gnArvcWaH6I,And it will be good for your child make him rough around the edges
gnArvcWaH6I,Do they know by being teached that logical step of “if nothing was added or substracted it must be the same”<br>Or do they just naturally intuitively learn it on their own?
gnArvcWaH6I,I laughed so hard
gnArvcWaH6I,Isomer Mashups 😂😂 i honestly wonder how long you could do that until the kid realizes
gnArvcWaH6I,@Rico Saavy eaasssyyyyy there tough guy... U must realllllly hate chicken nuggets mate.. Its otayy. We get u some bettewww food for the YT tough guy!!
gnArvcWaH6I,Hahahahahahahahahaaaa. Lol suckerrr
gnArvcWaH6I,This whole thread is gold
gnArvcWaH6I,"@Rico Saavy Enjoy your essential oils,or whatever you eat."
gnArvcWaH6I,The point of the test is to prove exactly ehat you said it proves. You know the answer to your own question.
gnArvcWaH6I,"It is. Math is in nature. And this isn’t math. It’s just basic logic. <br><br>All you need to do is define the concept of quantity, then you very easily realize:”okay if no quantity was added or substracted, that means its the same even if its another shape”. <br><br>That’s it. Solved it for you without math."
gnArvcWaH6I,I pray for him
gnArvcWaH6I,@random name I was smarter
gnArvcWaH6I,"He&#39;s 4.5 years old, what did you expect?"
gnArvcWaH6I,"The point is, Piaget was right, kids at that age dont grasp conservation. The logical step of ignoring visual intuition and thinking “okay if no water has been added or taken out, it must be the same amount, no matter what my eyes tell me”. <br>THAT’S what the kid is lacking. Not language."
gnArvcWaH6I,"In most instances she does define it well. <br>She says how many coins. Not what length the raw of coins is. <br>She says how much water, not how tall it looks. <br><br>The kid actually realizing what the “amount” of something means, and making sure he is thinking about THAT variable, well yeah he is not doing that, but that’s the point of the experiment. <br><br>If you tesch the kid what “amount” means, as opposed to how high the water looks, how long the raw is, etc, youre not only teaching the language, yourevteaching the logical solution to the problem."
gnArvcWaH6I,"For a child in a submissive environment (with one or more authority figures directing their actions) where they are not encouraged or reminded that they can say &quot;I don&#39;t know&quot; or to ask &quot;what do you mean&quot;, it is as easy as asking &quot;which weighs more, a pound of iron or a pound of feathers&quot; to manipulate the answer that you want. The testing techniques here are at fault. Their supposition may still be true, but from this test we cannot say because of these semantic flaws."
gnArvcWaH6I,"Nope. It’s a matter of not integrating logic, just letting your visual intuition go. <br><br>As we grow we learn to logically think “okay, if no water has been spilled, it must be the same amount no matter what it looks like”. <br>Kids still haven’t “censored” their intuition or senses in that way yet. He just sees a larger amount of water because it goes higher, he doesn’t stop to second guess himself because he has never been told to do that yet. <br><br>In a sense, yes, you are right, she could say “what quantity of quarters, no matter how long the row is, is there?”<br>That would be using the correct language. But it’s not a problem of language, it’s a problem of logic. <br>Words have a definition because it’s from there that we can apply logic. He confuses more with more long or more quantity just because he doesnt separate each variable in his head. No matter the language."
gnArvcWaH6I,"Very interesting observation. I think you’re right. Kids at that age will believe what you tell them, so we must be very careful."
gnArvcWaH6I,You could have just used normal language too.
gnArvcWaH6I,@Valerie H.  you would be correct the point of this test I&#39;d to determine whether or bot a child can understand concepts such as conservation and volume at young ages
gnArvcWaH6I,Or he only has surface area awareness at this stage.
gnArvcWaH6I,"What other method is there? You have to ask the kid, how else can you get his answer."
gnArvcWaH6I,Not me.
gnArvcWaH6I,Zoë Parker he’s in the pre-operational stage of Piaget’s theory (which is from ages 2-7).
gnArvcWaH6I,@GDI Because people don&#39;t take into account what &quot;services&quot; they may have received for said taxes.
gnArvcWaH6I,@elodens4 zero would be the perfect refund because you didn&#39;t overpay the government. And they&#39;ll hold onto that extra money all year. And you get zero interest from it
gnArvcWaH6I,@elodens4 That would only apply to the conservation tasks topic if they had the ability to compare the amount they were refunded with the amount they didn&#39;t have to pay - but <b>nobody</b> does. That&#39;s why its irrelevant. Understand?
gnArvcWaH6I,"@GDI The more someone gets in their tax refund, the less they think they got taxed. The less someone gets in their tax refund, the more they think they got taxed. Make sense now?"
gnArvcWaH6I,james Barrie Trump is statistically a good president
gnArvcWaH6I,Ben Shapiro destroyed that kid.
gnArvcWaH6I,That&#39;s how I saw it too.
gnArvcWaH6I,he didn&#39;t learn from chuck e cheese about sigh-cologie and how to magically weld scraps of leftover pizza together
gnArvcWaH6I,"first name, last name another great comment by the legend"
gnArvcWaH6I,You’re worried that people haven’t taken the same psychology classes as you? Seems like most people are trying to explain why he can’t understand in a logical manner rather than you just accepting “oh yeh that’s what kids that age do” <br><br>Rather than just accepting it maybe there is something to be improved in the way things are taught.
gnArvcWaH6I,Exactly!
gnArvcWaH6I,"@Jeremy Day the answer is: developement. The kid sees very nicely and explains how she just stretched or moved objects etc, but it&#39;s brain/thinking or whatever is just not developed enough to make the connection, or realise nothing has been added to the object. A mans brain/intellect goes though developement, not just our hands, legs or other pars we can see. I think this just shows, when it comes to education , we could do more about developing intellect, teaching kids how to think, developing their thinking.. not just stuffing theim with all the information what is just a waste of time."
gnArvcWaH6I,Kid in his wonderful stage. He’s pretty good and his answers were as expected according to Piaget. I wish this kid a healthy lifespan development.
gnArvcWaH6I,@Princess Bubblegum did nothing wrong &quot;Unfortunately facts don&#39;t care about your feelings&quot; LOL all the while you&#39;re arguing from emotion. That irony is hilarious!!
gnArvcWaH6I,@Princess Bubblegum did nothing wrong &quot;I&#39;ve heard his argument many times and it&#39;s a really bad one&quot; aka his facts trigger me and I&#39;m biased to trans people so I&#39;ll just deflect his entire argument as wrong.
gnArvcWaH6I,"Because no 5yr old understands what &quot;gender&quot; even is, we used to call this child abuse but now its called &quot;progressive&quot;"
gnArvcWaH6I,"@Princess Bubblegum did nothing wrong <br>​ Princess Bubblegum did nothing wrong  Oof, I wish I had seen this earlier. I think you should give people the benefit of the doubt and argue against what they&#39;re actually saying especially since assuming might get you into hot water if their views are very different from what you would think them to be. <br>Many people, including trans people themselves, don&#39;t think that children should be allowed to medically transition due to them not fully being able to fathom the risks or potentially even the gravity of what they&#39;re doing. There are permanent effects, and unknown risks that come with it, and while for a consenting adult they should be able to do whatever they want with their body, a child being allowed to make that decision with what we know could do more harm than good. Especially if they end up regretting it. Even adults, who should have completely developed brains to be able to make better decisions can end up regretting it. There&#39;s no going back from the physical changes you get from taking the opposite sex hormones (and there are a bunch of other health risks in general). So I find it&#39;s a reasonable argument to think that in the specific case of children, medical transitions should not be allowed. But having this view doesn&#39;t make one transphobic, it&#39;s a risky path to take and some just aren&#39;t comfortable letting children have the choice to do so.<br><br><br>But aside from that, I was wondering do you have a clearer argument on medical transitioning for younger people? Because, hormones at 8 years old are becoming a thing and if you don&#39;t set boundaries or lines, things can easily go farther. If you have some sources for an argument on that  though it would help though(probably going to be to late to help but who knows XD)."
gnArvcWaH6I,Huh

gnArvcWaH6I,This comment made my night
gnArvcWaH6I,You just won the internet!
gnArvcWaH6I,Listen I&#39;m telling Satan it&#39;s all your fault when I arrive.
gnArvcWaH6I,"I mean there are multiple possible reasons of why this child isn&#39;t &quot;stupid&quot; in this experiment, like it just doesn&#39;t grasp the idea of length and volume and quality the same way they should be understood by society, sort of like defining it differently. But I am saying that kids also in general are simply less smart. I as a kid was saying stupid stuff too."
gnArvcWaH6I,Not everyone develops the same or are the same. That&#39;s what makes us human. You obviously dont understand that which makes me think you dont have any logic. Use your head next time.
gnArvcWaH6I,If it’s annoying to watch don’t watch it

gnArvcWaH6I,@Autechre Fan 4.5 is older than 4
gnArvcWaH6I,DID YOU JUST ASSUME THEIR GENDER?!
gnArvcWaH6I,"@Daniel How do you think a child psychologist, teachers of young children, parents etc know the average development of a/their child? Through experiments like this. You want to change the nature of the experiment altogether which no offence makes no sense. <br><br>You want to change it to do children of a certain age have the ability to learn when corrected in these conservation tasks. They are trying to showcase the average child&#39;s development at this age from piaget theory in these conservation tasks."
gnArvcWaH6I,"taylor marie there are many ways to do experiments. I would be interested to see if a child ,that had the concept explained, could do the rest of the questions right without being told. <br><br>The issue I see with this experiment is because the child thinks he is correct that strengthens the faulty logic he is using so is more likely to do the next questions wrong."
gnArvcWaH6I,No offence but you are all wrong in this comment section. the point of this is to demonstrate the development of an average kid his age. It&#39;s not about developing or helping the child to learn but more like to measure the average development If that makes sense?
gnArvcWaH6I,"@Mr. Meeseeks I wouldn&#39;t go that way necessarily, but we&#39;re basically talking about child upbringing here and that is a very delicate topic. Personally I would neither tell him his either right or wrong, I would tell him if he wants the answer (or asked him if he wants to know the answer), but wouldn&#39;t try to force the explanation on him and try to make him &quot;smart&quot; by force."

gnArvcWaH6I,"CALM DOWN, PEOPLE"
gnArvcWaH6I,@TheSassi42 in Australia it&#39;s law for super markets to lable each product with it&#39;s cost per 100 grams or 100 millilitres. So an easy cost comparison can be done.
gnArvcWaH6I,"Yeah, air is expensive nowdays."
gnArvcWaH6I,"Some adults buy bigger glasses of nutella, believing bigger glasses have a lower price per mass, even when the middle-sized glasses have a lower price per mass."
gnArvcWaH6I,Brandon Shave the packaging is the same size. I buy the packaging and not the stuff in it anyway. Trolol
gnArvcWaH6I,"I have heard that when a child gets to choose one of the objects as a reward then their ability to identify quantities is shown to be accurate.  I imagine that the test would be something like this:<br><br>1)  Show child two different quantities of juice with the same presentation, so that the child can understand which is greater.<br>2)  Move one quantity to a different glass.<br>3)  Allow child to choose a glass to drink."
gnArvcWaH6I,Do also consider that a lot of kids his age are not confident about communication. He might be trying to gage what the adult means by &quot;more&quot; and adjust accordingly as he goes.
gnArvcWaH6I,"Not exactly. Before we are very familiar with numbers so we can count things even without noticing it and before we understand basic concepts of measurements of volume and mass, we use more simple and primitive visual cues to get to our conclusions. This is what is happening here."
gnArvcWaH6I,"@Tofu yes but he stated he thought there were more because the row was wider. This was prevalent throughout almost every situation they put him through, the glass of water had more because it was taller, the play dough ball had more because it was flatted out, etc all after the original coin situation. It&#39;s clear he was your typical child, not being able to differentiate and understand the concepts of mass, area, compared to size and value. My opinion."
gnArvcWaH6I,"When they are spread out, they take up more space."
gnArvcWaH6I,I had a similar reaction to what you describe. I was forced to do more tests after that. Once I got really mad and told them I was no longer &#39;playing&#39; their games. I was referred to a child psychologist that was no nonsense afterwards. I was very fortunate.
gnArvcWaH6I,Doubt it!
gnArvcWaH6I,No wonder why wars and conflict  never ends in this miserable planet
gnArvcWaH6I,Haha racism
gnArvcWaH6I,I think ehat he doesnt grasp is the concept of “amount” or “quantity”. <br>“Is there a higher amount of quarters?” Would be a much clearer question that already hints you the answer.
gnArvcWaH6I,"You sir are correct, the child in question does not have a proper understand of &quot;more&quot;. The point of the test is to see if a child early in development can understand concepts such as conservation and volume"
gnArvcWaH6I,the title says it all that these are typical answers children typically give because their brains haven&#39;t reached being able to understand concepts like mass staying the same regardless of xyz
gnArvcWaH6I,Why don&#39;t you look up Piaget first.

gnArvcWaH6I,Mean..
gnArvcWaH6I,Looool
gnArvcWaH6I,Maybe paying attention to hair is also a kind of cientific observation...
gnArvcWaH6I,I disagree.  This is well designed because she presents the options &quot;Are they same&quot; after both presentations so the child can still say they are the same.
gnArvcWaH6I,"Yea except she asks him &quot;WHY&quot; which is important. He&#39;s not saying its different just because he heard &quot;how about now&quot;, he gives a reason for why he thinks that. Sadly, you and the child&#39;s IQ might be pretty close."
gnArvcWaH6I,That&#39;s a great point
gnArvcWaH6I,"Hahn k F actually I think what it shows is more a leaning to instinctual survival led psychology / cognition, in that, the object that appears larger, longer, taller or has significantly changed - is the object the child focuses on and selects more readily. When the form changes back to the same as what the child noticed was the same as before. It&#39;s the same - because it looks as it was and the changed one is always selected."

gnArvcWaH6I,And gender relates to this... How?
gnArvcWaH6I,After a certain age they give the right answers. The difference can be from age 4 to 5.
gnArvcWaH6I,Every single child before the age of 6 is like this. It&#39;s a well known stage of psychological growth in children. Literally grab any kid who&#39;s under 6 and try it out.
gnArvcWaH6I,Vika K not researching on human development means what other stating the kid will be smarter than you true.
gnArvcWaH6I,TheUiopas No actually most kids fail Piaget&#39;s test before the age of 5 because they don&#39;t develop the concept of mass and length conservation until the age of 6 through 8.
gnArvcWaH6I,James Spirit oh lord no. there is no gravity? That is the most ridiculous thing I have heard today.   I am very open minded so please explain.
gnArvcWaH6I,Volume is more related to chemistry while mass is more related to physics
gnArvcWaH6I,Pea Stone ok.
gnArvcWaH6I,"Michael Emakhu No, it doesn&#39;t define mass, but you asked what does inertia have to do with mass so I answered. I think I&#39;m done here."
gnArvcWaH6I,"Pea Stone no. Inertia indeed  is related  to mass but it does not define mass. Object with mass can indeed resist motion but that doesn&#39;t explain what mass is. Think of it like this, gravity can be said to be a force oppose by normal force that affect a human or object, but that does not define  what gravity really is."
gnArvcWaH6I,"Capitalism with a little bit of socialism sprinkled on top is the perfect economy, too much socialism is bad, humans are greedy and selfish, that&#39;s the reason we can&#39;t have full capitalism."
gnArvcWaH6I,eyescreamcake what is that supposed to mean
gnArvcWaH6I,At least he knows more about basic economics than a capitalist.
gnArvcWaH6I,Atilla Lonny xD yea totally
gnArvcWaH6I,Socialism is the gr8est thing everrrrrr!
gnArvcWaH6I,"Yup. The adult was usually referring to volume here.  But even adults eouldn&#39;t always use &quot;more&quot; to mean more volume - for example, if Bob is carrying more cash than Joe."
gnArvcWaH6I,"Makes sense. According to the kid, the definition of &#39;more&#39; is more height of water, not more volume. Not strictly wrong."
gnArvcWaH6I,Explain how more liquid was correct. I&#39;ll wait.
gnArvcWaH6I,Didn’t think about it this way. Actually makes sense.
gnArvcWaH6I,"Until a certain point in their development, kids don&#39;t understand basic concepts like mass or volume. It&#39;s mostly just to see what stage in their cognitive development they&#39;re currently at. Kind of like how babies don&#39;t understand object permanence."
gnArvcWaH6I,It’s true if someone wants you to answer a certain way it defiantly effects you
gnArvcWaH6I,Boring I’m sure that is involved
gnArvcWaH6I,The kid probably felt like he needed to give a different response when she said &quot;how about now&quot; since it implies that there is a size change and also it seemed like she was expecting that certain answer from him
gnArvcWaH6I,Totally agree. She asks him to explain but doesnot correct him after every questions. How is the poor fella going to learn the right answer? Her method of conducting the “experiment” just makes the boy look silly.
gnArvcWaH6I,"@jon paul<br> I don&#39;t buy that this is a typical 4.5-year-old. <br><br>Unless the reasoning is that 4.5-year-olds are typically 4.5 years old, and because he is 4.5 years old, this kid is typical."
gnArvcWaH6I,TheSassi42 lmao glad you did well.
gnArvcWaH6I,"Multi Malware The video was very interesting. I tried the panamath test and got low scores. I did it again, trying to improve. Afterwards I understood that low scores are good xD"
gnArvcWaH6I,I agree with you absolutely Theo.
gnArvcWaH6I,"Multi Malware The assumption that most kids think this way at the age of around 5 could be based on an experiment with a systematic error. If you could point me towards studies, that take the concerns raised in this comment section into account?"
gnArvcWaH6I,"Yes, at 4.5 years of age, he&#39;s still got a one directional form of logic. According to Piaget&#39;s theory of cognitive development, this child is in the pre-operational stage, and so far he&#39;s demonstrating the typical response to the task. This task has been done thousands of times to demonstrate this as part of typical development."
gnArvcWaH6I,"jon paul the fact that he explains his reasoning does not refute the authority figure thing. <br>Kids just do things because theyre done. He doesnt have the intelectual rigor to think “I know it changed because of this, now if she asks me I’ll tell her”. <br><br>He just saw she asked again, and thats a clue in his life that tells him he should say something different, because we do that a lot when teaching kids. Then asked why, THEN he thinks of what may be the “correct” answer that the adult wants. He thinks he is being led by her the whole time. Hes a kid. He doesnt know those kind of mathematical statistical boundaries where you are asked as in a test objectively. He follows."
gnArvcWaH6I,Very interesting.
gnArvcWaH6I,"jon paul <br>If there is a systematic error in an experiment, it does not matter how often you repeat it. As long as the systematic error is not removed, the same wrong results will be shown."
gnArvcWaH6I,"It makes perfect sense. I also believe the child is only giving different answers because the same person asks the same question twice, seeming to expect a different answer. My suggestion would be to use a computer program like Google translate to read the questions and a automatism to move the objects. I prefer your uni&#39;s suggestion to use two adults and let the child be the messenger."
gnArvcWaH6I,"The tangent Jon Paul seems to be going off to is completely detached from the discussion at hand, as if the actions of pedophiles should in someway dictate what the result of this test is. Even if children think just the same as adults, you could still argue that they lack a lot of experience and understanding that you gain naturally as you grow up. That includes a richer vocabulary and a basic understanding of any given situation you&#39;re in.<br><br>I find sir Weiner&#39;s response absolutely level in comparison, and they make a compelling argument to repeat this experiment with different variables or with variables eliminated entirely."
gnArvcWaH6I,"To me, it feels like the kid is giving a different answer the second time because that&#39;s what he thinks the adult wants to hear. By asking him the same question twice in a row, it makes the kid feel like he screwed up somehow, so he changes his answer. Not because he understands what&#39;s going on (he clearly doesn&#39;t), but because he wants to please the adult."
gnArvcWaH6I,"If you haven&#39;t noticed, children have very short attention spans. My 5 year old can&#39;t remember what I said to him 4 seconds ago. They also don&#39;t have very good spacial reasoning. These things combined, it is easy to see how they could make such an assumption as &quot;one stick is longer than the other&quot;"
gnArvcWaH6I,Have you ever spoken to a child? They&#39;re actually really dumb.
gnArvcWaH6I,"Akaakaaka ak Yeah dude, there TOTALLY is no way someone might percieve the world in a way different than yours.<br>Cause, you know, when human is born his mental abilities are already 100% developed, right?"
gnArvcWaH6I,"Yeah, especially since when you just look at two sticks there&#39;s no way to know which one is the moved one"
gnArvcWaH6I,cheeseman congratulations you are smarter than a psychologist
gnArvcWaH6I,"I agree, however &quot;Could of&quot; doesn&#39;t exist and is therefore stupid"
gnArvcWaH6I,Well it won&#39;t do much good trying to explain why he&#39;s wrong. He doesn&#39;t even understand why he&#39;s right.
gnArvcWaH6I,"Lol you&#39;re missing the point, this is a stage every child on earth went through, including yourself. The video is merely showing universal stages of child development."
gnArvcWaH6I,It&#39;s not about him getting it right or wrong. It&#39;s examining his ability to perceive two equal sets of objects and then see how he logically reacts to them being put into different situations in which they look unequal.
gnArvcWaH6I,TYPICAL CHILD&#39;S RESPONSE. why do a lot of people miss that?
gnArvcWaH6I,Arsene Wenger you sound like someone I could trick into thinking you have more quarters by spreading them apart
gnArvcWaH6I,Arsene Wenger why do scientice post their findings in the internet?
gnArvcWaH6I,"Arsene Wenger, you haven&#39;t noticed much about youtube yet have you?"
gnArvcWaH6I,Most kids will say the same thing and once you get older you would understand these concepts but some kids even at a young age already have that capability so they seem like outliers but they too at one point in their life may have given similar answers
gnArvcWaH6I,LustyBear that&#39;s social &quot;science&quot; for you.
gnArvcWaH6I,"According the Piaget&#39;s theory of cognitive development, the next stage is at 7-11 years of age. All children develop at different rates, but 2-7 year olds fall under the pre-operational stage which is marked by a huge increase in language (from a few hundred to a several thousand in as little as 2 years) and an increase in symbolism, but their logic and understanding is still limited to a one directional form of thinking. Google Piaget if you want to know more about this particular theory."

gnArvcWaH6I,"Mister Guy, and now youtube has convinced half the people that the world is flat again... hopefully it will be soon Jesus comes back, because people are getting really dumb and dangerous."
gnArvcWaH6I,"Frood Where exactly were they testing the shape of the Earth when they cited it for all those years?  You are comparing apples and bullshit, but by all means keep pretending science is on your side.  How exactly do we improve upon a test that has given similar results from children all over the world, for over 90 years?  Imagine that we had 90 years of proof that the Earth was round, and then the Flat Earth Society came in and said it wasn&#39;t true.  That is how much proof you have this test isn&#39;t accurate.  By all means, continue questioning science with a proven track record without offering or citing a SHRED of evidence!"
gnArvcWaH6I,jon paul We alsp thought the Earth was flat and the center of the universe for a good thousand years or so... Ideas and knowledge change. This test certainly could be improved upon.

gnArvcWaH6I,"&quot;Conservation refers to a logical thinking ability which, according to the psychologist Jean Piaget, is not present in children during the preoperational stage of their development at ages 2–7, but develops in the concrete operational stage at ages 7–11. Conservation refers to the ability to determine that a certain quantity will remain the same despite adjustment of the container, shape, or apparent size.&quot; from Wikipedia.

gnArvcWaH6I,"The conclusion of this test is that children that are in this developmental stage don&#39;t know the difference between more and bigger, yet. This child thinks it&#39;s more because it takes up more space. It still has to learn the difference between more and bigger"

We all stared at it dumbly when we saw how different it was, and my friend literally said &quot;well I would have failed that test.&quot; <br>Like, we were intellectually aware it was the same volume, but we suddenly understood how easy it was for kids to mistake it."

gnArvcWaH6I,It is not a linguistic issue. This isn&#39;t the only study of the kind.
gnArvcWaH6I,"the first example, as jack finan points out shows the kid doesn&#39;t understand quantity. he understands what more means. otherwise he wouldnt know what the same means and wouldnt be able to judge if the same glasses were as full. <br><br>to show another example of something similatr to this is emapthy. If you took a child and introduced them to another person, toldf the child that this person keeps some money in a box. show them the box with the coins, then have the person leave the room completely. and then tell and show the child that you are removing the coins and putting them somewhere else. then bring the person back in and ask the child where they think the person thinks their cins are. they point to where the coins actually are because the part of their brain that can think from a 3rd persons perspective isn&#39;t developed, they arent capable of logical empathy. eventually a child will develop to where they are able to understand the person doesnt know the coins moved. just as here a child should eventually develop to understand what does and doesn&#39;t change different forms of quantity."
gnArvcWaH6I,"I think from this video alone we can&#39;t tell, but I have the suspicion that it&#39;s a linguistic thing."
gnArvcWaH6I,"they should start teaching moleculer biology, organic chemistry, anatomy etc in kindergarden."

gnArvcWaH6I,Aleksandar Solaja so you&#39;re wondering if it&#39;s a language comprehension/expression issue more than anything else
gnArvcWaH6I,yeah i had similar thinking. you can tell by his sigh and the way he looks at the camera before answering some of the questions.
gnArvcWaH6I,"Ktari Amine well I wouldn’t say that because if you use such term often they start to draw up little “policies” in their heads. For example, “when mommy says the line at Walmart is long, it’s usually got more people in it than other lines.<br>“When daddy says that the new office is bigger than the last one, he means it’s got more space”<br> However, no baby would think this fluently. It would be something along the lines of that. During the earliest stages of development, all they do is listen and take in the world around them because of how alien it is to them. Imagine if you time travelled from the 1800’s to know. Way before the industrial revolution, you’d be confused why your neighbors are less than 10 miles away, or if you live in the same building as them. Or how such large amounts of people roaming around an area of towers and strange metal structures that move on wheels."

For example, to truly accept this notion as a good representation of each races intellectual capacity, the actual data would need to be analyzed, for things such as sampling techniques, areas and populations that were sampled, sample sizes, the test utilized to gauge intellectuality, really also needs to be shown along with the statistical evidence. For example, correlation, doesn&#39;t always mean causation, and in the case of your statistical representation linking ethnicity to intellectual capacity, may in fact be showing us instead, that certain races are more prone to actually taking an IQ test in the first place, with a desire to see their intellect in comparison to that of other, which may show us psychological factors at play, were candidates randomly chosen, or were they specifically hand picked, were the samplers knowledgeable about the people included in the experiment, or were they blind, what were the socioeconomic factors in this study, do they give a better distribution in regards to intellect, rather than ethnicity?

gnArvcWaH6I,"+David Gutowski Acording to my Psychology teacher, it&#39;s true that infants lack the sense of Object Permanence. However, that stupid &quot;peak-a-boo&quot; game adults play with their children does not qualify. The child very well knows you are behind you hands. If it thought you&#39;d disappeared, it would immediately begin to cry."
gnArvcWaH6I,+David Gutowski I don&#39;t need to because I know it does work this way (I study educational psychology). Things can still be the truth and look like they&#39;re acting.
gnArvcWaH6I,"+Saba Tassawar Actually, Piaget (the father of modern developmental psychology) claimed that children are &#39;little scientists&#39; who go about their world hypothesis testing (scientifically testing things!). It should be noted that this same guy is the butt of many a joke since much of what he found was wrong."
gnArvcWaH6I,"+Saba Tassawar Psychologist here. You&#39;re wrong, unfortunately. Children do understand this. They are actually getting confused by is the experimenter asking them if anything is changed, they assume that it has changed because the adult experimenter is confusing them."
gnArvcWaH6I,@AbuBakr Akram well kids dont work on human defined scientific methods. they have their own pure thoughts whic we cant judge over maths or already present laws and theories.

gnArvcWaH6I,"Thats also how people figured out the earth is flat in recent years even though its been proven to be a globe for many many years now, but using sight it looks flat because the angle is so small that you cant really perceive the curve on the horizon. I.E piagets test on adults... -_-"

gnArvcWaH6I,the best is &#39;35% reduced sugar&#39; when in actual fact you&#39;re just getting the same thing but 35% less of it
gnArvcWaH6I,"That&#39;s the whole point. The concept of &#39;Conservation&#39; as an organisation for measurements is all about the way the brain tends to use only a single criterion for judgement of quantity (Like the height of water, or the number of pieces, or the length of the row). As children develop, the brains starts to learn how to adapt to better understand dynamic quantities, but the neural base for conservation remains."
gnArvcWaH6I,"It has no connection whether he understands the meaning of yes or no, if he does not understand what he must say yes or no the test does not work. He responds badly because he does not have a sufficiently developed vocabulary. I do not think a child makes the difference between same and like. In addition, children often seek to please adults, looking for the thing to say to please. In this video the adult clearly directs the question as if the correct answer was &quot;yes&quot;."
gnArvcWaH6I,"@FreeHomeBrew In a different universe you could have topological objects, which are not conservative. The brain is very adaptive."

We can&#39;t help but assume that if someone is asking the same thing twice in a row, the answer must have changed...or why would they ask again...<br><br>If I said &quot;how tall am I?&quot; And you said 5&#39;10&quot;...then I said &quot;now how tall am I?&quot;...you might pause for a second...instead of just being like &quot;obviously the same height as 5 seconds ago&quot;.<br>The fact that I asked again makes you rethink it. Though as adults we can rethink it and NOT change our answer unless something actually changed."
gnArvcWaH6I,They did an experiment on that as well. They used the same idea with asking about the amount of coins in a row and then they got a toy bear and made it seem like the bear destroyed the row of coins rather than the experimenter modifying it. The children said it still had the same amount of coins so it can be assumed that the children change their response due the researcher&#39;s direct manipulation.
gnArvcWaH6I,Maybe make a previous pair of questions have the same answer so the child has a chance to realize that&#39;s a possibility.

gnArvcWaH6I,"Yes and no. English vocabulary is quite general. The linguistic part plays a big role of course, but the same events can be observed in children that speak other langages. You are part right, but still."
gnArvcWaH6I,"I don’t think so. If what you’re saying was true, he would be looking for words to say how theyre not actually the same. He isnt doing that. <br>It’s not language whathe lacks, is logic. <br>He does not understand those basic logic principles: he goes with visual intuition. <br><br>He doesnt stop and think “well if she hasnt added water, then no matter what my eyes see, it must be the same amount of water”. <br>That’s the step he is missing. <br><br>Teaching him the difference in language about those things, eould automatically teach him the logical reasoning he is not using:<br>If you told him “now here’s what actual quantity means, which is a different thing from seeing a quantity distributed more wide long or high”. Then youd be teaching him the logic along with the vocabulary. Its tied together."
gnArvcWaH6I,"Exactly, children are cognitively limited, and most science has now reached the consensus that you aren&#39;t mentally mature until as late as age 25.   That is why we shouldn&#39;t defer to children on constitutional matters or gun control, and should leave that debate to adults with more experience and mental capacity."
gnArvcWaH6I,"Probably, but it&#39;s funny to make the kid think there&#39;s something wrong with him hehe :D"

1pD50ISxP3k,"100% true! After getting pregnant hearing baby cries at work was very different compared to pre pregnancy. At times I&#39;d ask if the parents could tell the cry differences, and usually it boiled down to the babies are each unique and the parents of multiple kids harped that the most! Each baby learns to communicate with its parent differently, even if techniques are the same, the overall needs of the child are different from the last. That being said, it still didnt stop me from asking if it was a hungry cry when I felt a full body electric current then my chest ache (it was usually); I wonder if some mothers can tell physically from the pheromone exchange that alters breast milk, if its a hungry cry."

gIZ8PkLMMUo,"I’d add 2 parent LOVING household. I had 2 parents but terrible emotional household full of fist fights, arguing constantly, ignoring me and my needs, and I was constantly dismissed and told I made them sick because I wanted their love, communication and attention."

gIZ8PkLMMUo,I don&#39;t trust ANYONE who goes to Africa to &quot;study&quot; kids that have NOTHING to do with their own environment. Study kids where you live dont go around the world 😒
gIZ8PkLMMUo,"I agree with your comment because all the parents should learn about this and practice more how to teach their kids with all those values. In my psychology class, we talk about something important that is the parenting styles that can be really important in human development. In this case, we talk about the parents, I think that all of them should practice an authoritative style because they can be involved through the decision in their lives and what they learn every day."

gIZ8PkLMMUo,"Yaaha agree to your point divya ,💯 correct"
gIZ8PkLMMUo,"Divya - OMG, you have just said what I have always felt. If you give a child time you give them love because you are validating them. A counselor asked me once to describe my childhood, and immediately I answered there was never enough time."
gIZ8PkLMMUo,"can&#39;t give them time when you&#39;re dead:(  I think that is the point he is making. It&#39;s a little wishy washy, I don&#39;t see how his conclusion inspires a different approach to psychology at all:("
gIZ8PkLMMUo,"But, didn&#39;t You raise one of the parents?"
gIZ8PkLMMUo,Thanks you saved me 8 min
gIZ8PkLMMUo,yes but he wasn&#39;t clear though...and too nervous
gIZ8PkLMMUo,From the talk not but from the commentsection yes :)
gIZ8PkLMMUo,"He didn&#39;t give ANY answers, let alone definitive ones. He basically said &quot;It depends on the environment, so your question is wrong. In a later speech he could tell you how changing a child&#39;s environment constantly is bad."
gIZ8PkLMMUo,&quot;active&quot; is the crucial word here
gIZ8PkLMMUo,Paul Baker   Baby don’t hurt me
gIZ8PkLMMUo,What is love.
gIZ8PkLMMUo,So very true dominika 😊 i agree parents need to be the best versions of themselves before we can help our children be the best of themselves
gIZ8PkLMMUo,This video is off base.
gIZ8PkLMMUo,how so?
gIZ8PkLMMUo,It’s important not to have expectations. Let this be a lesson.
gIZ8PkLMMUo,Try putting closed caption CC
gIZ8PkLMMUo,@Laurie Dunn : Exactly !!!! Totally agree !!
gIZ8PkLMMUo,What on Earth are you even talking about?
gIZ8PkLMMUo,"@AngelTacha87 I agree with you. Love is important in our lives but at the same time, we should give more than love to them. It is the connection of love, values, feelings, culture, and more that define them and create a behavior or a personality in the future. If they learn what they should learn and receive each year of their lives, they will be ready for the world and they will learn more for their environment."
gIZ8PkLMMUo,@AngelTacha87 Beautifully summarised 🙂
gIZ8PkLMMUo,"Loving them is not enough. They have to be shown how to love, have compassion for and help people around them. That&#39;s why he talked about the environmental factor... you can love your kids all you want, it will not necessarily make them good people. And to illustrate his point, he gave the example of the school in which the kids had collected wood sticks to later donate to their classmate&#39;s family for the funeral of their deceased loved one. It all comes down to what kind of values you AND your community teach your kids. Loving them goes without saying but that alone it&#39;s not nearly enough to raise decent human beings."
gIZ8PkLMMUo,Yes.
gIZ8PkLMMUo,single mothers are a biblical plague - Jesus
gIZ8PkLMMUo,"@Lore IsGreat  as parents we have the responsibility to teach our children the truth that we have found and tasted. When they grow up they will decide what they want. If you take 3 religious books and 3 ateist book( John Lennox, Ravi zacharias and William Craig vs Richard dawkins, Christopher Hitchens and Bart Ehrman ) you will found that God exist and from there the Bible will teach you rest."
gIZ8PkLMMUo,"No not everyone is relgious, Muslim, Christian, etc. Let a child choose their own faith, beliefs, and who they want to be i have nothing against religious beliefs btw."
gIZ8PkLMMUo,I went to daycare and loved it. It was where I made my first friends and had plenty of stimulation. I also had lots of time with my mother and my family outside of daycare. I have a friend who never went to daycare and found it very hard to adjust to kindergarten because she was with her mom and baby sibling every day.
gIZ8PkLMMUo,"So he mentioned being orphaned, gender inequality (I.. e. Girls not having the same access to schooling than boys) , extreme poverty (I.e. not having access to basic needs like clean water and sanitation) etc. And your comment is that divorce and daycare is the worse. <br>Just to add  I&#39;m from an African country and know the extreme struggles people go through. There is a reason child mortality rates are so high. <br>So I am not minimizing the effects of divorce, I just find it weird that this man is talking about children who don&#39;t know when they will have food to eat, and then the comment is that divorce and day care is worse.."
gIZ8PkLMMUo,@AllenPrincess ATX
gIZ8PkLMMUo,"Thanks for the comment. I do have two young children and before my husband and I had them, we were blessed to set ourselves up financially where I could stay home and care for them. I also was a product of a stay at home mommy and a Masters degree and wonder life later, I am doing well. I understand that some families have different circumstances and that two parents working is what they have, but if they are both working with a focus on materialism vs the well being of their child, then that is not good. Thanks again."
gIZ8PkLMMUo,Tiffany a good daycare with good mentors can become a child’s community care like the video mentioned. However I fail to see anything good out of a divorce. Apples oranges
gIZ8PkLMMUo,It seems you comment contradicted itself. You went to study effects of migration yet there was no migration. I don’t understand. Are you referring to farmers with children giving up farming and moving to urban environments ?
gIZ8PkLMMUo,Dayum Bruh-- you know some Kenya
gIZ8PkLMMUo,Francis Nwokedi it does sound loaded with irony
gIZ8PkLMMUo,"According to the custody laws in California, a child only needs a mother... I cry"
gIZ8PkLMMUo,nobody realizes this <br>constitutional republic
gIZ8PkLMMUo,"It can’t just be any caregiver, it needs to be their mother and father, they need make and female role Models, the most well adjusted kids are children from stable - traditional marriages, all these people experimenting with these new families are doing it at the risk of their child’s development, it’s unbelievably selfish and the undermining of the nuclear/traditional family not only contributes to the crumbling of our society, but is damaging children in many unknown and immeasurable ways, so as much as you want it to be “any” kind of loving caregiver, the evidence is overwhelmingly against you."
gIZ8PkLMMUo,"Exactly! I thought he was going to say Seld Esteem. As parents our goal is to raise healthy, happy and self confident children."
gIZ8PkLMMUo,@Lord Jim True. It was quite a vague speech. It didn&#39;t reflect the title of this video. It was more like a lecture.. very lukewarm with no passion
gIZ8PkLMMUo,I was half expecting this guy would burst into tears towards the end of the video. What a lame and disappointing speech.
gIZ8PkLMMUo,"@Abifail   you do not know that, at all"
gIZ8PkLMMUo,Amrit Borah only for for first few years
gIZ8PkLMMUo,"Amrit Borah <br>I actually was thinking the opposite, but you opened my mind to an interesting pathway"
gIZ8PkLMMUo,"Jack, I am quite inexperienced and wish to know more. I have a doubt, don&#39;t u think that giving undivided attention would only make it worse in his adulthood when he receives rejection, failure ?"
gIZ8PkLMMUo,... and then they will destroy your life from puberty upwards. 🤣
gIZ8PkLMMUo,"@Robert Warner super unhelpful and not at all necessary. plus jesus would support single parents who are trying their best to raise their children, not the parent that walked out or those who judge single parents 🙄 keep single parents out your mouth"
gIZ8PkLMMUo,Thanks
gIZ8PkLMMUo,single mothers are a biblical plague - Jesus
gIZ8PkLMMUo,"@Will.J it is but in second is touch, we are social people"
gIZ8PkLMMUo,"@Account nutrition does play such a vital role in brain and character development, tho. So its a yes and a no type of situation"
gIZ8PkLMMUo,"gizachew nurie He says environment is the biggest influence - the people, situations, and beliefs that make up that child’s world."
gIZ8PkLMMUo,"Allah swt creates he is Al Khaliq (The Creator) you are just the means to deliver the baby. Dont give the attributes of The Most High to the creation that is Shirk (associating partners) with Allah, which is the only sin if you are to die on that is unforgivable. Anything less than tha Allah can forgive."
gIZ8PkLMMUo,"@Argi A yes it is like that kids always copy what parent do, not what parent tell them to do"
gIZ8PkLMMUo,single mothers are a biblical plague - Jesus
gIZ8PkLMMUo,@Michael S You are wrong
gIZ8PkLMMUo,Yuka yes very well said
gIZ8PkLMMUo,"Imanuel Israel He says environment is the biggest influence - the people, situations, and beliefs that make up that child’s world.<br>So that’s what you look at to sort out the problems."
gIZ8PkLMMUo,I would want to see it thank you
gIZ8PkLMMUo,Me🤣
gIZ8PkLMMUo,@Robert Warner you good homey???
gIZ8PkLMMUo,single mothers are a biblical plague - Jesus
gIZ8PkLMMUo,🤣🤣🤣
gIZ8PkLMMUo,LetterD Lmao truuuuuue
gIZ8PkLMMUo,"@Natalie Gwin Right but the speaker wasn&#39;t clear enough in my opinion, and too nervous"
gIZ8PkLMMUo,"deepu abraham <br>Environment is the biggest influence - the people, situations, and beliefs that make up that child’s world."
gIZ8PkLMMUo,"Brenda Wamae He says environment is the biggest influence - the people, situations, and beliefs that make up that child’s world. That includes the values they learn in that environment."
gIZ8PkLMMUo,"If the traumas don’t take root in the child they have a smoother time blossoming into adulthood. If the traumas root then there’s a lot of other factors that come into play. Did they find a mentor or role model. Did they find someone to learn how to trust and communicate  healthfully. Did they have the genetic makeup to withstand the rigors of the environment and experience. Did they find help and therapy.  Endless factors. Love, I try not to use that word. It opens a Pandora’s box of questions. What is true love anyway. Unconditional love ?"
gIZ8PkLMMUo,I wonder how a kid will fair in a loving home but raised by Nazi&#39;s.
gIZ8PkLMMUo,"April Scheid <br>Well stated because outside of the physical needs <br>The most important to raising a healthy secure child is a loving gentle disciplined, accepting unconditionally because there will be storms between parent and child <br>We all want a child that doesn’t cause us stress!<br>Not going to happen<br>That’s their job<br>Trying to test their limits and you’re supposed to have the energy to fix the problem<br>It’s really not hard when you decide to do it<br>As marriage <br>Same work<br>Keep at it<br>I have 1 boys living proof <br>I’m truly amazed at what true love wi do to transform an individual.<br>I’ve witnessed this since I was 11. I have cared for many children and have seen the positive improvements with time love consistent expectations and consequences to fir the crime"
gIZ8PkLMMUo,Amen!!!!
gIZ8PkLMMUo,April Scheid wow! Best comment k ever read !
gIZ8PkLMMUo,I love this ❤️ thank you 🙏
gIZ8PkLMMUo,wow don&#39;t watch it if you aren&#39;t interested.
gIZ8PkLMMUo,Take a shot every time he says society and culture are the important influence (not their father)
gIZ8PkLMMUo,Take a shot every time he says a father is important.  Don&#39;t think he said this even once.
gIZ8PkLMMUo,single mothers are a biblical plague - Jesus
gIZ8PkLMMUo,"@avicohen2k Exactly. I wonder what was in his mind when he made the presentation. When you watch it, it doesn&#39;t make sense, but when he created the presentation he must have though his points through. How did he decide to go with this??? He just wanted to sound smart, that&#39;s all."
gIZ8PkLMMUo,"@Natalie Gwin All variables are depended on environment, so saying that environment is most important is redundant. The question should have been &quot;What is the most important thing we can do for our children?&quot;, but we don&#39;t need to be so technical."
gIZ8PkLMMUo,@Justin Aeneas I comprehended the meaning of the talk.  The idea that outside forces shape who you are is not a new idea.
gIZ8PkLMMUo,Baloney. “Context” is a huge concept to explore. Find your own answered instead of looking for someone to provide them.
gIZ8PkLMMUo,single mothers are a biblical plague - Jesus
gIZ8PkLMMUo,DOUGLAS WOOSLEY q
gIZ8PkLMMUo,DOUGLAS WOOSLEY sounds like she was a wonderful mother. I hope to be remembered as a wonderful mother too.
gIZ8PkLMMUo,DOUGLAS WOOSLEY y
gIZ8PkLMMUo,I agree
gIZ8PkLMMUo,Goddess warrior
gIZ8PkLMMUo,"Tracy Weiss yes, I agree. That’s where I feel my responsibility as a parent comes in to teach my child what I feel is the best direction."
gIZ8PkLMMUo,"This is important. Let them express their feelings, you don’t always have to agree but understand them"
gIZ8PkLMMUo,All0utj3rk everyone is practically divorced or single because society doesn&#39;t support woman or marriage.
gIZ8PkLMMUo,"To judge means to think. <br>In context, you seem to use &quot;judging&quot; as having a negative thought and expressing it to &quot;them&quot;. As such, I don&#39;t see how it&#39;s wise avoid saying such things as &quot;it&#39;s not ok to hit your sister over the head with a bat.&quot;<br>So, let us acknowledge first that we do judge with our minds. Secondly, let&#39;s understand that there is a healthy balance of positive vs. negative &quot;judging&quot; that we express to kids. I.e., &quot;good job&quot;, &quot;you have amazing potential&quot;, &quot;you have a great singing voice&quot;, &quot;your math skills are improving well&quot;, &quot;It&#39;s not good to cuss out your teacher&quot;, &quot;keep up the good work&quot;... etc. <br>To avoid negative words altogether is abusive towards the child and towards the society in which you raise the child."
gIZ8PkLMMUo,"Janis single are unfit mothers, they purposely chose a bad mate/pushed the man away and created a broken family 4 the child"
gIZ8PkLMMUo,I think renowned psychologist Carl Rogers would agree.
gIZ8PkLMMUo,single mothers are a biblical plague - Jesus
gIZ8PkLMMUo,"I’m finding that not trying to teach them anything seems right. Yes, we can tell them to not throw things or hit but keep it bare minimum. My son actually teaches me a lot about myself."
gIZ8PkLMMUo,Alien 51 absolutely. You have to communicate these ideas regularly and consistently though for them to take root.
gIZ8PkLMMUo,Alien 51 yes. Many people do it. Simply teach right and wrong. Respect. You don&#39;t need religion for those.
gIZ8PkLMMUo,single mothers are a biblical plague - Jesus
gIZ8PkLMMUo,"@A. Smith - You are right, I&#39;ve re-assessed and change my mind, after seeing his new ego-driven lamest rap ever recorded, he goes into the history books of lamest fks."
gIZ8PkLMMUo,@What The that is so mean.
gIZ8PkLMMUo,What The <br><br>What are talking about? Read what he wrote and engage your brain. Try.
gIZ8PkLMMUo,i agree
gIZ8PkLMMUo,❤️💕💗💯💯✅
gIZ8PkLMMUo,mashaAllah one love for ever Insha-Allaah
gIZ8PkLMMUo,"Just wonderful, I been tryin to find out about &quot;coaching children&quot; for a while now, and I think this has helped. Ever heard of - Elilan Coachify Domination - (search on google ) ? Ive heard some decent things about it and my buddy got cool results with it."
Nt4CypX2XPw,"@BingBong 1234 that’s not the point. I’m sure whoever made this didn’t have ill intentions, but bias is sneaky."
Nt4CypX2XPw,OMG give me a break.
Nt4CypX2XPw,If it helps you sleep at night my white daughter throws tantrums like this often and can&#39;t speak like this....
Nt4CypX2XPw,Same I feel..she is definitely not 2
Nt4CypX2XPw,Yea no offense but that’s not a 24 month old .
Nt4CypX2XPw,Yeah right 😆
Nt4CypX2XPw,Put that boy in Mensa
Nt4CypX2XPw,yes some children have higher genetic potential than others that is why this comments section is nasty and people are mad at the pediatricians criteria
Nt4CypX2XPw,Right?  Remember when people were completely satisfied when you simply said a few words.
Nt4CypX2XPw,So much work that youre watching videos on YouTube about things that aren&#39;t related to you lol
Nt4CypX2XPw,bruh I’m younger than 13. OFCOURSE NOT 13.
Nt4CypX2XPw,Ikr “this is a 7 year old” “my child is <i>_____</i> and started talking at 3” like we get it every child is different
Nt4CypX2XPw,😂🤣😂
Nt4CypX2XPw,@creepfromouterspace 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Nt4CypX2XPw,Best comment
Nt4CypX2XPw,Contact the circus. I look forward to hearing from you!
Nt4CypX2XPw,I’m 168
Nt4CypX2XPw,"Talk to paediatrician not YouTube, that would be a good first step."
Nt4CypX2XPw,"My daughter is 2 years and 3 months and only just started walking 3 days ago. I know it&#39;s hard but try not to worry, she will get there in the end. I just kept on standing her up and holding her hands so she could get used to using her legs. Just keep practicing and she will be walking in no time."
Nt4CypX2XPw,They are mad at the pediatrician because their kids do not meet criteria so they want to argue.
Nt4CypX2XPw,Zimtkind  lol before I commented something similar to what other Moms are saying then I saw your comment it is funny but I agree I don’t want to feel like I have done something wrong because my son is very advanced in everything except his want to talk at all. I don’t want any moms feelings guilty every kid is different and also I do agree this girl seems older than 2. But lol your comment was funny
Nt4CypX2XPw,@0 I guess..
Nt4CypX2XPw,Cute
Nt4CypX2XPw,He has Athletic Intelligence (Bodily-Kinesthetic Intelligence).
Nt4CypX2XPw,"We have three children 14, 8, &amp; 2. Our only girl, eight, was/is smart at everything and development is above her age. No worries bc boys can somewhat be delayed just due to our makeup. Does he respond to your commands or dad&#39;s? If so then there&#39;s no hearing problems nor cognitive issues. Please update since it has been nine months now."
Nt4CypX2XPw,"Ow you haven&#39;t, this video is all wrong, it&#39;s either the girl is older than two years or she has been going to classes, a lot of mothers are saying their two year olds can&#39;t speak like her."
Nt4CypX2XPw,"Yes, because children of a certain age are all the same size and speak at the same level 🙄"
Nt4CypX2XPw,I&#39;m a child educator and there are many children who speak this well by 24 months. There are also some who aren&#39;t there yet with language.
Nt4CypX2XPw,"kripkripix my child absolutely was this size at 24 months. She is now 2y 10 months, over 3ft and 40lbs. In 100 percentiles. I don’t get how people are judging the child based on size."
Nt4CypX2XPw,"kripkripix I’m confused. You say this child is maybe 2y, plus? I mean, 24 months is 2 years..."
Nt4CypX2XPw,It&#39;s not just her skills. Her physique and face are not typical 24 months old. Maybe 2 year plus.
Nt4CypX2XPw,Wow!
Nt4CypX2XPw,I was pretty sure I was going to be murdered
Nt4CypX2XPw,haha that was basically the only thing of value I obtained from the video
Nt4CypX2XPw,"@Łüćkÿ Jøñëš <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nt4CypX2XPw&amp;t=0m30s"">0:30</a>"
Nt4CypX2XPw,lala loom 😆😆😆 I noticed that too. Lol 🤪
Nt4CypX2XPw,Bullshit.
Nt4CypX2XPw,"Easier said than done when you have family and your husband breathing down your neck telling you how you are failing because your 27 month old son is not speaking like this 24 month girl in the video is and when you say that you personally got made fun of all your childhood by your aunt for not speaking until 3 years and then proceed to be blamed like, “oh it’s your fault! It’s your dna that caused it”"
Nt4CypX2XPw,This is the best comment.
Nt4CypX2XPw,"I need this comment, thank you! 😊"
Nt4CypX2XPw,"This is what I wanted to hear/read. My son is 25month, not talking yet. Some days like today, it consumes me. This gives me hope. Thanks from Uganda 🇺🇬"
Nt4CypX2XPw,Thank you for this comment. You just made my day. May God bless you.
Nt4CypX2XPw,now I just turned 11
Nt4CypX2XPw,She looks like 2. <br>I was like her at 2 :) <br>My brother was talking so much when he was 2. <br>BUT WOW THEY SAID SHES 3 AT THE END? WOWW
Nt4CypX2XPw,"lali :p yes you’re so right my daughter turned 2 , 3 days ago and she is doing all this and she counts from 1-10 , knows her shapes, colors and her abcs ... and if a child is not doing this yes it doesn’t mean ther a something wrong with them it could be parents are not teaching them :( but I agree with you not the other comment 💯"
Nt4CypX2XPw,My son is in 99th precent and classified as intellectually gifted and he&#39;s two years old and 6 months and speaks some Spanish in English that girl still is bigger the clearer than he does I call b s*** on age but still a smart beautiful child
Nt4CypX2XPw,Alicja Majewska hey hun I live in England aswell. How did you teach your son both languages one parent one language or?
Nt4CypX2XPw,"As long as they talk by 4, they are OK and developing differently. Don&#39;t worry moms. I have 2 grown kids and a 2 year old. Each one of my children have spoken at different times. You&#39;ll are doing wonderful jobs. Just keep talking, reading and loving them. ❤"
Nt4CypX2XPw,@Shenanigans thanks
Nt4CypX2XPw,@Emiline Bellé I&#39;m sure she meant 25 months or 2 and a half one of the two. OBVIOUSLY
Nt4CypX2XPw,Dont feel bad. Each child is different!
Nt4CypX2XPw,Dont even worry infact that&#39;s great he will learn both hopfully.  Dont let that part of his culture be stripped from hin
Nt4CypX2XPw,Don&#39;t worry kids can take up to 4 languages just stick to english and his dad to Arabic
Nt4CypX2XPw,"Many bilingual children take a little longer to speak than children who only have one language to learn, but don’t worry they will catch up!"
Nt4CypX2XPw,"Jasmine Amer, try not to let it bother you too much. If you’re worried about a speech delay try contacting your pediatrician. Otherwise, I’d just wait and see. Make sure you speak and interact with your child often, as they learn a lot that way."
Nt4CypX2XPw,@Playground dolls I Agree some children are taller. Also the pediatrician knows her birthday not the youtube commenters that are mad their kids dont meet criteria.
Nt4CypX2XPw,"@Kelsey gretchen Yes! My 2 year old (2 1/2 now) was diagnosed with autism and expressive speech delay, in June. So it makes more sense as to why he isn&#39;t talking. He can label a few things, but he doesn&#39;t talk for communication, he doesn&#39;t put 2 words together. And that&#39;s fine. He&#39;s in speech therapy, and we are working on it. But it comes down to every child being different, it doesn&#39;t make one child smarter than another, and I can guarantee toddlers are not worried about what people think😂 they just want to be happy and play!"
Nt4CypX2XPw,Shes 16 prolly lmao. Yall come on 🤦‍♀️ just cuz ur child isnt doin these things (which is fine kids are different each is I have 2 they were not the same on the same time frame) but dont try to say she isnt her age cuz my son was actually doin all this by his birthday. Hes now 26mo
Nt4CypX2XPw,@ashley martinez exactly my son is doing all the things she is he is 26mo. Each kid is different but people dont say that unless it&#39;s about a child who&#39;s not doin things. Each kid is different period some ahead some behind some on track. Each child is different and that&#39;s NORMAL
Nt4CypX2XPw,@Antonio anticipated 🤦‍♀️ my 2 yo is doing all the same things she is hes 26mo
Nt4CypX2XPw,"My niece doesn&#39;t speak much at 4yo even. But she&#39;s intelligent in other ways, I played connect4 with her and her response is very fast."
Nt4CypX2XPw,"Very true. Out of 4 children only one was speaking  this well by two years old. One needed speech therapy, but that was because we had a lot of upheaval in our lives at the time he was learning to talk.<br>The fourth is two, she&#39;s saying some words clearly, some not so clear. It really depends on not just the child, but also what the parents work on with the child. My children sometimes would and sometimes wouldn&#39;t want to learn."
Nt4CypX2XPw,@Tonk4wot I appreciate this 💜...I really do ....
Nt4CypX2XPw,"@Tweatie Connally to hell with this video, I’m sure you’re doing amazing. Even trying to research this and ending up here means a lot."
vpXrgJ5aj_4,"@Jim acid giving birth really must have been a unique experience, wow. I wish I could be on that level some time"
vpXrgJ5aj_4,I knew a real hippie chick who took acid when she was giving birth for the experience of it and her kid turned out very intelligent
vpXrgJ5aj_4,"Ok well I am by no means a neuropsychologist however, I have read much on the topic and am currently in post secondary education for the topic. So one of your questions I do have an answer to, question 3 regarding social experiences in teens. Yes it is important for children to experience social interactions. If a child is not exposed to adequate social stimuli they are at risk of developing anti social/anti personality disorder, which has all kinds of terrible effects, immediately and for the future. This is a kind of stunting. Stunting meaning a section of time were a child is lacking a specific form of sustenance. Stunting is usually due to lack of food, vitamins or minerals, however, a sub-classification of stunting is just what you said a lack of social interaction at a young age. These effects have no treatment are appear to effect the person for the remainder of their life. So yah let your child go to the playground. If you care to read more the world health organization has an article going more in-depth on the topic. Cheers."
vpXrgJ5aj_4,As someone with autism and ADHD I agree and I hate hearing all those noises when I sleep which is why I were ear muffs
vpXrgJ5aj_4,"Europe&#39;s advantage is it&#39;s social infrastructure which emphasizes community connections. Europe has, via it&#39;s ancient traditions, smaller geographical size and longstanding family ties, a heightened sense of &#39;community&#39; in it&#39;s social structure which aids communication in children who are taught the importance of community. <br><br>America, on the other hand, has eradicated community in favor of corporations because cooperative communities are &#39;power bases&#39; that can say &quot;NO&quot; to the government. Corporations get all the benefits of a communal workforce but bear no responsibility for the wellbeing of their employees. Corporations are used to redirect the generated wealth of local communities into the pockets of the 1%...who then use that wealth to control government regulations.<br><br>The government then uses the building codes and zoning regulations to restrict affordable housing and interdependent communities from forming...the infrastructure of community...which efficiently strangles community in the womb.<br><br>Community infrastructure in America can only be found in religious communities (like the Amish, the Mormons, the Mennonites, the Hutterites or the Bruderhof Communities, etc)...hippie communes, street gangs, prison gangs, military units &amp; submarine crews, secret societies (Freemasons, Skull &amp; Bones, etc) and socialist cults like &#39;The Move&#39;."
vpXrgJ5aj_4,"Good hypothesis, dont know answer tho"
vpXrgJ5aj_4,"I work with young children and hope my info can help. 😊 There are some benefits to technology because there are educational videos you can watch with them, however, it is much more valuable and enriching to bring children outside to play or give them sensory items. Their brains will develop a lot more if they are experiencing different senses (touching things, exploring, even falling down) than if they are just visually watching things or scrolling."
vpXrgJ5aj_4,Very informative. Thank you
vpXrgJ5aj_4,"@Bonjour hello, I just got that fact from the presentation. I very confident to say this was a research journal presented and publish some magazine or presented to a reknown institution. If you can trace her research she cited all the work she based on. May be contacting UCLA university and the department within they might help you to track it. I  wish I can help you more, but hope this trace path help you reach the source you are looking for."

rIruPw97Z-c,"Or you know, it just happens to represent the three individual kids that are actually in the video 🥴🙄 would you prefer they lied to better  suit what you want the results to be 🤡"
rIruPw97Z-c,"The girl was even more guilty, as she spotted the mirror and just made them understand, that she would eat the cake but not this time."
rIruPw97Z-c,Foxy. Lol
rIruPw97Z-c,right
rIruPw97Z-c,Liar!!
rIruPw97Z-c,"The girl was even more guilty, as she spotted the mirror and just made them understand, that she would eat the cake but not this time."
rIruPw97Z-c,a lot of that has to do with socialisation imo tho
rIruPw97Z-c,Lmao yeah right
rIruPw97Z-c,21area21 Forget the sample size tho. I suggest to not refer to this test and rather refer to the stats of men upholding  riskier jobs than women according to the National Bureau of Labor Statistics.
rIruPw97Z-c,"@Krish Dutta It is true, but ImmaSnarl is also right. This is a sample size of 4, and you can&#39;t extrapolate anything from such an insignificant sample pool."
rIruPw97Z-c,"Kevin Coffey It’s not offensive, it’s straight up facts"
rIruPw97Z-c,"I don&#39;t know if this is a joke, or what"
rIruPw97Z-c,naa braa!
B8bq2k5kcjI,I pray that you are safe and healthy too!!
B8bq2k5kcjI,Self reliance
C7O0U9OGHew,they said 10 words not 20
C7O0U9OGHew,Damn you got a late bloomer too?
C7O0U9OGHew,Love this comment
C7O0U9OGHew,"That&#39;s nothing, the baby in this video was able to be both 18 months and clearly almost 3 at the same time, beat that!!"
C7O0U9OGHew,Best comment
C7O0U9OGHew,"Weak. My child was pre-accepted into Harvard in the womb and had already achieved all of that, as well as scaling K2 (alpine style, obviously) and pioneering a new cancer treatment, by the time he was three months old."
C7O0U9OGHew,"@Tarredandfeatherable my son is the same way he babbles like crazy and runs every where. He will bring you things if you tell him to give it here or  can i see it or can i have some. He just doesn&#39;t talk, the Dr. has us starting speech therapy because he says my son is supposed to be saying at least 50!!!! words now"
C7O0U9OGHew,"Same here with my boy. climbing, destroying everything. He Closely examines electronics. He can turn his toys off and on- but no spoon. The stupid doc just recommended a speech therapist, because he&#39;s not reciting Shakespeare at  exactly 18 months .   Before this he said he needed a physical therapist to get him to crawl.. well we didn&#39;t listen and now he runs everywhere. My wife is in tears.  Don&#39;t sweat it, its all arbitrary bs. They get kickbacks from referrals to these unnecessary therapists from nervous parents. We read and sing to him.. thats all you can do.  A scared baby is only going to shut down with a therapist  around anyway!"
C7O0U9OGHew,Super smart child
C7O0U9OGHew,How&#39;s your baby doing?
C7O0U9OGHew,Bro same
C7O0U9OGHew,"@Noora Queen what a judgemental comment, she is not “so behind”, all children are different, some don’t talk until 3 years old and it is perfectly normal. As long as they’re doing other things “expected” of their age, then I wouldn’t worry one bit."
C7O0U9OGHew,"Thats fine, just give her time. She will get there :) just pray :)"
C7O0U9OGHew,She’s so behind almost 2 years !!! And only says mama
C7O0U9OGHew,"Doed he point now? Mine is 16 months, doesn&#39;t point but does most of these things."
C7O0U9OGHew,"There is a wide range of normal at this age. My 18 month old knows body parts, but can&#39;t handle a spoon that well, she prefers to use her hands. And she hates drinking from a cup and prefers water bottles. If you&#39;re really concerned ask your pediatrician."
C7O0U9OGHew,"I&#39;d prefer you to ask a Specialist ,"
C7O0U9OGHew,No babies develope at different rates
C7O0U9OGHew,@Jeffy getsm same my son was born with clubfoot and had pop for 8 months(from 1-9 months) now he&#39;s 17 months and he&#39;s not walking or standing on his own yet. It scares me
C7O0U9OGHew,Soha Ali baloch my daughter does all these except walk also and she’s almost 18 months I am worried as well
C7O0U9OGHew,.. Sounds like a past life comment to me!
C7O0U9OGHew,Wow god bless her 🙏🏻
C7O0U9OGHew,I love that you replied because you described our scenario. Be well and safe
C7O0U9OGHew,@Ahmed Masad don&#39;t worry. He is 3.5 years old now and speaks so well. Boys are a little slower than girls sometimes. Just keep it up. Trust me they are absorbing everything you say and do.
C7O0U9OGHew,@Matt NA my son is 18 months now and he is exactly as your son when he was 18 months<br><br>Your comments relieved me a lil as your got better after that I hope my son will start talking soon as well
C7O0U9OGHew,@Matt NA tq for ur quick reply
C7O0U9OGHew,@Sravani❤️✍️ I wrote this a long time ago. My son us turning 3 today and he is fine. His speech picked up very quickly after I kept going with talking to him. I bought a set of DK picture books and kept at it. He is pretty quiet but he has a strong language ability now.
C7O0U9OGHew,"Dont feel like this. My first born was like u say and now at 5 years îs verry ok. The second born, a girl, do all The stuff and more..<br>Not every Child îs The same.!"
C7O0U9OGHew,"Don&#39;t feel bad! Have you checked out Happa Family on YT? She gives helpful tips there. I was worried about my daughter too, and that&#39;s helped."
C7O0U9OGHew,@A B Thank u
C7O0U9OGHew,Thanks for the reassurance 😩😩 My son is definitely speech delayed. He’s smart tho he just doesn’t want to talk.
C7O0U9OGHew,"Kids grow at different rates plz don’t make such videos dishearten you, especially boys are usually 6 months delays vs girls. Once they are 5 year old they catch up to the same rate."
C7O0U9OGHew,@Ghada Ibrahim I&#39;m a mom too and she&#39;s the same size as my 18 month old
C7O0U9OGHew,70% of children who are delayed in language are no longer delayed by age 7! Many kids catch up!
C7O0U9OGHew,"if a child is not meeting a development milestone at a certain age, it doesn&#39;t mean there is something wrong - but there could be.  Going to a doctor can give parents&#39; peace of mind that their child is developing normally, or get the child help if s/he needs it."
C7O0U9OGHew,Kiri Suta thank you for this comment...I’m a bit relieved now
C7O0U9OGHew,Appreciate it
C7O0U9OGHew,I dont have any kids but i am getting ready to babysit a relative&#39;s 18 month old and im super nervous. I watch these videos to know what to expect.
C7O0U9OGHew,I Agree since my sone has startes walking at 17 months
C7O0U9OGHew,"The doctor is not very supportive! You can Google early childhood intervention programs. They can point you in the direction of therapists, O/T, speech etc to work on things. A good paediatrician will help too. You can also get assessments such as autism tests done."
C7O0U9OGHew,Have you talked to your daughters pediatrician? They can refer you to a specialist if needed!
C7O0U9OGHew,@Bhavini patel🧡 now she&#39;s 20 months old. Still cant say a word. But she always babbles as if she&#39;s talking to someone
C7O0U9OGHew,Same my bub is not saying singal word too
C7O0U9OGHew,"Ten words is actually not that many for 18 months, mine says about 50 clear words right now. But all kids are different and I bet ur baby is doing other things that mine isn&#39;t. Don&#39;t let these videos guide you."
C7O0U9OGHew,"Nexus Seven hmmm my 14month old can do the same, but thats normal."
C7O0U9OGHew,@Danetria Jones  hi can we talk and looking for some answers
C7O0U9OGHew,If you don’t mind me asking. What were the results? I am worried my daughter has it but not sure. She sure doesn’t do things that are in this video and she’s 19 months
C7O0U9OGHew,What about now?
C7O0U9OGHew,Take her to see a naturopathic doctor. They helped me tremendously with my 18 mth old whom I suspected of being autistic as well.
C7O0U9OGHew,Her pediatrician she be able to tell you if her behavior is average or not. Take her to her doctor!
C7O0U9OGHew,"When he does that just say no, and move him away from you. Don&#39;t shout, don&#39;t look at him, don&#39;t give him any kind of attention, because that&#39;s all that he wants - attention, it doesn&#39;t matter if it&#39;s positive or negative. When he does something nice, praise him, give him kisses,  so he will learn what he needs to do get your positive reaction :)"
C7O0U9OGHew,Mine does the same
C7O0U9OGHew,Same problem here
C7O0U9OGHew,they learn by watching you
C7O0U9OGHew,@Taylor Nicole Wolfenbarger it&#39;s been a long time  but how did you potty train your baby? I started my son at 14 months. It&#39;s been 2 months and he still doesn&#39;t know when to tell me he need to go potty. He sometimes signals me to change him after he poops his diaper. I feel like it&#39;s so close but im missing something in the training process.
C7O0U9OGHew,"Same as my daughter she is going to be 19 months soon and she would tell me if she need to go toilet.. she can sing ABC song, she knows all the colors and counting numbers also know all the body parts and name animals. I&#39;m so proud of her."
C7O0U9OGHew,Taylor Nicole Wolfenbarger that’s awesome! I have a 16 month old and she is no where near being ready to start.
C7O0U9OGHew,"Misha I started her at 13m, she was showing all the signs to start! Her little sister is due in August so it helps me out big time knowing I would have 2 in diapers."
C7O0U9OGHew,Dang that&#39;s early to be potty trained
C7O0U9OGHew,I have autism and i dont like toddlers
C7O0U9OGHew,"@Barbara Billafon Don&#39;t feel sad Autsim isn&#39;t bad as Y&#39;all seem , Its just kids or people with it takes a lil longer to develop as a normal child would"
C7O0U9OGHew,shell company my son doesn’t speak too and is on the high risk M Chart his evaluation is only in February 😢 and I feel we are loosing precious time!
C7O0U9OGHew,I bet hes easily saysing 10 things not necessarily words..same thing
C7O0U9OGHew,Mydaugher is speak some word andeat herself doing work completely and engage adult but she have less sleeping why
C7O0U9OGHew,pranjal dabhade she’s pretty active. All babies are different!. ❤️ plus if your is a boy they tend to be more adventurous!. 😊
C7O0U9OGHew,how are you going to correct a developmental pediatrician and speech therapist. They have YEARS of experience and degrees.
C7O0U9OGHew,@M. L. i bet he says 10 things..not necessarily words...same thing
C7O0U9OGHew,"My son is 15 months and he does all of that, the only thing he can&#39;t do is saying 10 words, but only 6"
C7O0U9OGHew,"Nah my daughter has been talking since she was 13 months and can speak a full sentence and she is 20months now. She says more than 15 words, knows her body parts (has known them since she was 14 months) can recite the Alphabet without singing it, can count to 17 as of yesterday lol but been counting to 10 for months. The only thing she cant do yet is identify colors but she can say them."
C7O0U9OGHew,Skyler Albrecht she really don’t have to be 2 years old because my baby was doing all of that at 15months of age and everyone was telling me that’s a 2 year old development. And now she’s 17 months when I watch this video I felt so proud of my baby. My daughter was using a lot of words at the age of 1. She was drinking from a cup comfortably at 12 months with good control and no spills And she knew her body parts. She can tell you where is itching lol. We can’t underestimate these kids. They are like modern technology.
C7O0U9OGHew,My son don&#39;t know how drink self
C7O0U9OGHew,"Laxy 99 I don’t doubt it at all, both of my kids have had that size vocabulary at that age. All kids develop at different rates.  No need to call someone a liar."
C7O0U9OGHew,"My daughter is the same way.  Over 100 words, but using a spoon or a cup isn’t happening yet."
C7O0U9OGHew,"Yes definetly!but once they do they speak like a waterfall <a href=""http://lol.my/"">lol.My</a> daughter (18 m.o) used to say only Couple of words in English ,but nowadays she uses  german and in english in her 3 word sentences😊and always points things out in both languages  which pretty impressive to me because she always was such a quiet baby and preferred just to observe haha"
C7O0U9OGHew,I think so. My son only speaks a couple of words in English but he has picked up a word in Chinese. But he understands in both Chinese and English when we tell him to do things.
C7O0U9OGHew,@Jinabi Nij Who is tata then?  :D
C7O0U9OGHew,How is ur baby now? Im wondering . My baby can speak just mama papa tata like tha only
C7O0U9OGHew,Hi hws ur baby now... My baby also not speaking
C7O0U9OGHew,Orpa Nath you could always have them evaluated by a speech therapist if you are concerned.
C7O0U9OGHew,"My 18 month old has just finished her first novel, can pay the guitar and speak 3 languages. I&#39;m not at all smug or conceited like some of the other twats who have commented on here"
C7O0U9OGHew,"My son is 15 months and he does all of that, the only thing he can&#39;t do is saying 10 words, but only 6. I have 5 kids and all of them could do that at that age."
C7O0U9OGHew,Let&#39;s ignore the fact that a lot of parents (BOTH parents) have to work in order to take care of their family&#39;s basic needs... which means we leave our little ones in the hands of other people who may not care for our children the way we do.
C7O0U9OGHew,devilish cat I believe it has to do with parents going on their cell phones and not interacting as well as too much tv when we were children our parents didn&#39;t have smart phones and the only shows were on pbs a couple times a day . I refuse to let my son watch tv at all until he is 2 then he will be able to watch 30 mins a day and I put my phone away whenever I am with him . We also have a learning room that is separate from his room and toy room that we spend 2 hours learning new cognitive skills . I think people just don&#39;t realize the impact cell phones and television can have on their children
C7O0U9OGHew,i agree kids today are regressing i see a 2 year old toddler before asking what is a ballpen and now almost kid i know doesn’t talk much at 2 years old i wonder what happen to the new generation babies
C7O0U9OGHew,Urmila Allavarapu same
C7O0U9OGHew,Yeah. Pretty funny!
C7O0U9OGHew,What age did your baby eventually start talking?
C7O0U9OGHew,I won&#39;t worry much. I cared for boys at this age who are at the same level but all their siblings are normal. They also caught up gradually
C7O0U9OGHew,"My baby is 20 months old and she can  sing songs but her vocabulary consists of naming body parts and mommy, papa(grandpa), papi(dad), mema(grandma). She can not put sentences together and only say a few more words like duckies, ball, mine, baba(sippy cup)"
C7O0U9OGHew,"My baby can sing songs and make small sentences at 18 months. <br>Specially two words ,like its ok,not yet,bless you ,thank you ,oh no,love you"
C7O0U9OGHew,Mine too...and I know someone who&#39;s twins say more 15...I&#39;m a little bit worried
VmX_0rLO4Gw,Omg same. Now I don&#39;t feel as bad.
VmX_0rLO4Gw,I have special needs and I have a mild hearing loss and I am global delayed OK which means that OK that I learned slower than the kids and teenagers my age and I do stutter sometimes but it I doesn’t define who I am and I also  was premature when I was a baby and I’m 17 years old  and I have it my whole life and   my personality is silly happy and sometimes serious and  my favourite cartoons are the Power Rangers and Beyblade G revolution VeggieTales and monsters Inc. and toy story which is a really good show or movie
VmX_0rLO4Gw,You can do everything if you do best

bQpaMoq-x88,"I&#39;m in the same boat, and with COVID happening she hasn&#39;t been around other kids, so was thinking we just think she&#39;s ahead because we are her parents, but then talking with other parents they are surprised at what she does. <br>And you can&#39;t outright talk about it online as parents don&#39;t seem to likenit, it&#39;s fine for parents to celebrate kids doing things when it&#39;s around normal time, but if you have a kid that&#39;s ahead all of a sudden you are showing off. My daughter will be 2 at the end of the month, she speaks quite clearly, in sentences, can count to 10 organize things by colour, shape or size, she knows abc and the phonics sounds that corresponds with each one, even able to name some words starting with letters, my partner sits her at his PC he tells her what letters to press, space bar and enter and she does it without needing help now.<br>She does stuff that shocks me and my partner all the time, yesterday she read the word dad with zero help, 2 days ago she had 3 toys 2 next to each other 1 apart with a gap, she pointed and said 2 and 1 that&#39;s 3, our jaws are still on the floor lol. The throwing a ball always makes me laugh, she could throw a ball and hit me with it before she was even walking 🤣"
bQpaMoq-x88,Thank you so very much! 🙏🏾🤍🤍🤍
bQpaMoq-x88,You&#39;re welcome!
bQpaMoq-x88,Thank you!! 🤍
bQpaMoq-x88,Yes!! Does anyone in the family that has kids already say she is smart? My son is almost two and these skills all seem old to me. My dad says he’s really smart but I just thought it was normal. The talking skills only get better and it’s crazy how much they learn in a day! My son says things that I didn’t even know he knew. 3-4 word sentences and many of them lol
bQpaMoq-x88,Glad to hear it!
bQpaMoq-x88,Hi there! Yes!  I have an playlist dedicated to the sensory system / sensory processing. Hit the playlist tab on my channel and you will see it pop up. 💗
bQpaMoq-x88,This video was made in 2018.
bQpaMoq-x88,Update?
bQpaMoq-x88,Update?
bQpaMoq-x88,"I\&#39;m not sure but ,if anyone else trying to find out toddlers and tantrums  try Loctavan Teaching Toddler  Strategy (do a search on google ) ? Ive heard some unbelievable things about it and my partner got amazing results with it."
bQpaMoq-x88,"@Cici Thank you for the reassuring message. It was something that scared me a lot and I didn&#39;t know how to respond to it initially. I almost went into a depression, but after spending some time alone writing down my thoughts and feelings, I was able to respond to her anxiety in more selfless, caring way. You are absolutely right that all children need love and affection, that is how you nurture a well adapted , self aware and prosperous child. You son is lucky to have such a caring mother."
bQpaMoq-x88,My son is also 22mos and he has had a few anxious moments resulting in shaking.  (I am not an expert just a mom who has raised 4 kids). I have noticed that the second I pick him up and kiss him he calms down. I Think he is looking for reassurance that he is ok and that mommy is always going to be there. He is going through separation anxiety again with me only (not his dad). I have been told by outsiders that I am making a “mamas boy”. I hate that term!!! All babies need a bond with someone and usually that<br>Someone is mom.   <br>I think your child is normal and just is looking for reassurance. Likely she will outgrow this. It may be an early sign of an anxious personality which isn’t so bad just keep in communication with the pediatrician.
bQpaMoq-x88,Harvinder Parhar   Don’t worry. Your child is a wonderful person anyway. Here is a book to help you understand him or her: Uniquely Human by Dr. Barry Prizant. It gives so many examples of things that can baffle parents and others who know a child with autism. It stresses trying to determine WHY a child does certain things. It’s like being a behavior detective. This book has helped me as a Special Ed aide.  Your child is an important being who wants to communicate.
bQpaMoq-x88,"Mine as well, hard work aren&#39;t they!"
bQpaMoq-x88,Don&#39;t worry if your boy follow your instructions . N you must keep talking to your baby repeat same words again n again cause babies learn with repetation . Do watch videos on my channel playlist there are videos where m showing how to teach baby talk
bQpaMoq-x88,"Nothing tonworry dear if your baby following your instructions , some kind de do some availability bit late"
bQpaMoq-x88,"Hahah mine too, everytime i lay down, he either stand on my chest or on my head... I don’t know why they loving doing it but its not cute"
bQpaMoq-x88,things changed quickly after this lol
bQpaMoq-x88,"Hahaha! Yes, it sure is! Love it - especially living in CA with the fires and dry weather!"
bQpaMoq-x88,Same 😂😂
bQpaMoq-x88,Talk talk talk to him.  Put down the phone and talk to him.
bQpaMoq-x88,"Kate C. My son too he says a few words but not sentences, he just turn 3 🤦🏻‍♀️"
bQpaMoq-x88,I hope your daughter is doing well 👍🐎
bQpaMoq-x88,"Maybe it&#39;s nothing but to be shure check this boxes: Does he point with finger? Does he respond to his name? Does he look you in the eyes? Does he folow simple commands like sit down, give me that, come here? Does he play with toys? Is he playing with others? Does he ignore people? If you point with your finger in a direction of a thing you want him to see, does he look where you are pointing? Also have you noticed repetetive behaviour or strange body  movements, hyperactivity and <br>attantion deficit? If your child doesn&#39;t  do most of the first 5 things and has short attantion spann and repetitive things going on, get him evaluated so you can get him help. Early intervantion is the key!"
bQpaMoq-x88,Strength to you and your baby boy o/
bQpaMoq-x88,Good for you.
bQpaMoq-x88,Is he vegan ?
bQpaMoq-x88,"Go mama, go! 💜"
bQpaMoq-x88,Ryu Oreo hes 2 years and 8 months to be exact
bQpaMoq-x88,Kids OT Help of course!
bQpaMoq-x88,Lol!! Maybe Kai and her can be friends? He looovvveess that song too! 🤣🤣🤣
bQpaMoq-x88,Me too
bQpaMoq-x88,Ditto. I&#39;m in exactly the same position.
bQpaMoq-x88,That’s so interesting....
bQpaMoq-x88,Thank you!! Xx
bQpaMoq-x88,Talk to your doc about it. My little guy wasn&#39;t talking either and now he&#39;s doing AWESOME in speech therapy :) Your child sounds like a bright kid and working on the speech while he&#39;s still young will help him a lot. Having lots of things to say and no way to say it can get very frustrating for kids as they get older and they often act out as a result.
bQpaMoq-x88,I think some kids develop on their own time. My husband was valedictorian of his high school class and his speech was delayed.   I hope he or she catches up soon 👍
bQpaMoq-x88,LivingDead Demon Are they special needs?
bQpaMoq-x88,@JACOB BAKER she isn&#39;t talking about a specific age. She&#39;s giving us a guideline on what to expect between ages 2-3. Also a lot of toddlers develop at a different pace so if she did say months it wouldn&#39;t really matter unless you are teaching them these things in a specific order vs at their own pace.
bQpaMoq-x88,yea...that ruins the entire video. always say months
bQpaMoq-x88,Yasssssss
bQpaMoq-x88,This is a generalization of what a two year old on average should be doing
bQpaMoq-x88,Same question
bQpaMoq-x88,"Mine too, washing hands for 20 seconds that&#39;s how she leaned 😁"
bQpaMoq-x88,Yes! It’s exciting 🥰
bQpaMoq-x88,Mine is too
bQpaMoq-x88,"@Marina Julien  also, im unsure how YouTube works I&#39;ll message you my private information. Im an older mom who friends kiddos are all teens or late elementary. I sure could use the mom toddler talk as well!!"
bQpaMoq-x88,@Marina Julien  it&#39;s okay momma. You&#39;re doing what moms do- worry.  But all 4 of my kids different things at different ages. It&#39;s impossible to say a kid must do this or that at this age on the nose. Trust me just when you get discourage she will do what u are concerned she isn&#39;t doing. And you&#39;ll feel silly 😂. Good luck momma!   Enjoy this age it&#39;s so cute and fun! Trust me a 14 year old girl is the opposite of both those things 😅😅😅
bQpaMoq-x88,Thank you so much! That just made my night. I honestly do worry because I see the kids at church or the park...I wonder why she isn’t doing what their doing. I’m a first time mom. Short story I’m adopted and have very little family. So I’m not fortunate to have seen other kids grow up in the family. I have no reference but learning with her but thank you for your kind words. I really appreciate it 😊.
bQpaMoq-x88,"Hello! I&#39;m not the person you are asking questions to but I&#39;m a mom of 4 with a lil guy who just turned 2 two days ago.  Unlike my other kids my 2 year has very little contact with kids his own age. His siblings are significantly older. And I will say not being around kids his age significantly shows. So I wouldn&#39;t be to stressed about it:)  My son says words, knows his colors, and numbers. Yet he cannot speak simple sentences.  For example he cannot communicate phrases such as &quot; go fast.&quot;   Every child has their strength and weaknesses.  Albeit screen time should be limited nursery ryhmes and educational videos youtube has helped my son learn colors, numbers, the alphabet as well at learn the sounds of the alphabet.  Flash cards are great! I made some with index card tailored to fit his learning style.  I always say what I&#39;m doing or what I&#39;m handing him. I try to get him to say it as well. &quot; Thank You&quot; and &quot;please&quot; ...so forth.    Unless your child seems absolutely confused as to what you are saying don&#39;t lose sleep...stop watching videos and DON&#39;T compare your child. I have fallen down that rabbit hole one to many times.  I promise one day it clicks for them. We just have to let them do it on their own terms."
bQpaMoq-x88,"I&#39;m a music therapy student and I agree! Preparing a session right now and this is SO helpful, thanks!"
bQpaMoq-x88,+Kelly McGrath thank you!! ☺️💜💜💜

bQpaMoq-x88,"Mrs. Kingpin it’s hard to tell and kids develop so differently. Kids who may seem advanced as toddlers can be struggling later on or be at an average level by the time they’re in middle school. Or they may continue to be advanced from the toddler stage to adulthood or up to some lower age. <br>If a child struggle to do these standard things that’s something to pay attention to but the idea that a child has to be able to do the same things as the kids around them is unfair to do to a child because kids are individuals just like us adults and they are better at some things and need to practice at some or have reached their potential in some areas for that level of their age. So much comes in to play because one kid may be born early in a year and another late in the year (and we all know so much happens even in just one or two months for a child), so that’s another aspect why it’s important to not compare kids (even if they are born in the same month). <br>If one looks at children growing up in abusive homes they can physically be ok but psychologically seem to struggle with basic things because they didn’t have adults to invest time with them so they didn’t develop different skills and their language level will often be at a lower level. Often these kids from abusive homes will be very timid or very ”energetic” (due to low self-esteem or trying to cope with big emotions no one taught them how to handle etc).<br><br>It’s lovely to see videos such as this with a toddler who is happy and engaging and whose boundaries is respected (asking if they want to do different things and not having the child be met with disappointment if they say ”no”. <br><br>Please don’t compare your child with other kids, but if you, like other parents may notice things meet them there so they can excel to the best of their ability. <br>As a kid, adults considered me advanced and I started school one year early and skipped one grade, but around high school (even if I was he higher end at my class) I had reached a point where I had to work hard for my grades like all the other students at the higher end. The whole advanced is putting too much stress on parents and kids. <br>💛<br><br>Ps. I apologize in advance for any potential grammar/spelling errors, but English is my 3rd language."
bQpaMoq-x88,Hahaha! I did make a video on potty training (you can search “potty training”  on my channel). I had a long a road with it and we are just crossing over to completion 😂 I will have to make an updated video to share the entire journey.
bQpaMoq-x88,Thank you!! 💜💜
bQpaMoq-x88,"+Andres Brambila good point! This would be for 24 months. However, development happens at different rates! So while these are skills that a lot of 24 month olds will demonstrate. Some will take longer to meet these milestones while others may have already met them before 24 months."
bQpaMoq-x88,Yes I was thinking that too. Is this like 24 month old expectations.. I think so maybe?
bQpaMoq-x88,"Thanks, Ebony! Xx"
bQpaMoq-x88,"I disagree because this is the bare minimum. Either there is an issue or maybe there has been no active development of those skills. GRANTED, I have only a meagee 2yrs 1 Month of experience lol!"
bQpaMoq-x88,Exactly!
bQpaMoq-x88,Well said. Thank you
bQpaMoq-x88,"True my baby sister steals my trumpet and plays it some times  and  can say what Color  and objects is, and If she sees,you sweeping she will try to help If you let her and she can organise tiny castles yellow, blue, and pink in color order<br><br>Edit she is 2 and a half"
bQpaMoq-x88,I have noticed this some milestones are met and exceeded while others take longer to happen. For instance our son was born with club feet and he was delayed when it came to walking and did not start until 16 months then just absolutely exploded in progression. Then it seemed like he was having difficulty learning names of different objects but again all of sudden whatever had to click clicked and I can teach him any new object and he will learn the name of it within 10 seconds and remember it. Speech is the one right now that is taking him longer than anything else he does say quite a few words but for whatever reason it always seems to be when he feels like it I am sure this is normal so I just encourage him to speak. You can&#39;t force a child to speak if they don&#39;t want to in fact I don&#39;t believe in forcing a child to do anything my philosophy is if something isn&#39;t working do something else or do it another way that always seems to work.
bQpaMoq-x88,lovehope3753 so happy you found it helpful! Thank you for your feedback. 💜😊
bQpaMoq-x88,Thank you!!
bQpaMoq-x88,"@Nekole Amber it was a quite useful and amazing video, thank you ❤️"
bQpaMoq-x88,+thesefourguyz hahaha! That’s awesome!! 👏🏾
bQpaMoq-x88,Its normal I learned to talk really early by age 3 I was talking fluently   .
bQpaMoq-x88,Mine too! He&#39;s 26 months old and he&#39;ll stay stuff like &quot;I just want some broccoli but Daddy shut the door and said no&quot;
bQpaMoq-x88,I&#39;m sorry to hear this. I&#39;d imagine it is very tough to be in that position. They are lucky to have an aunt who is so aware of their needs!
bQpaMoq-x88,Pick one language. He&#39;s confused he may understand but he needs a MAIN language and stay in that lane with him...once he starts speaking the MAIN then go back to teaching whatever other language you want him to speak...
bQpaMoq-x88,@Yulia Shapira  ASD is a cluster of symptoms in different avenues that one shows. The main thing is &quot;regression&quot; where your DD losses the skill they once mastered. If you keep looking up ASD and its symptoms youll start focusing on the negative signs and start ticking boxes in your head(it drove me nuts for weeks)...try to see what your DD actually does good and if theyre progressing at all it can be slow but thats ok. Not all kids reach milestones on the dot. If you still have uneasy feeling. Get the hearing tested and definitely see a paediatrician.last thing you want is a false diagnosis and a stigma towards your little one. 🧡
bQpaMoq-x88,"@Maria Galicia Same with my DD. We are billingual, she is 19 months and I had concerns for ASD."
bQpaMoq-x88,My son is bilingual too filipino/ english he is 18 months old he communicates with shaking his head and nodding and a lot of babbling. I even looked up ASD and it just got me scared. In saying that i went to a paediatrician and he said my son doesnt have it. Its good to be concern by that age but i wouldnt stress out too much.
bQpaMoq-x88,Fay L very advanced you are beyond lucky
bQpaMoq-x88,my 2y/o can write his name at 2 .. is that normal 🤔
bQpaMoq-x88,It’s impressive I was not this smart but my mother was not this engaged
bQpaMoq-x88,Amber C Mine too she can also read some sight words
bQpaMoq-x88,​@Nekole Amber  Oh Oky Thank YOu
bQpaMoq-x88,"Hi there! That sounds pretty typical. They will likely still fall or lose their balance from time to time; sometimes until closer to the age of 3. You can always double check with your pediatrician if you are really concerned, but that sounds typical of a 2 year old&#39;s gross motor development. :)"
bQpaMoq-x88,Leave it for the parent to worry about
bQpaMoq-x88,Hey Ryan! Keep in mind that there is a range of &quot;typical&quot; development. Some kiddos may lag a little to develop a skill but can still be considered typically developing. If you think the delay is significant you can always suggest he/she check with their pediatrician.
bQpaMoq-x88,Nusrat Zaman same my baby will be 2 next month 🥴
bQpaMoq-x88,"kevin kevin same <a href=""http://here.my/"">here.my</a> baby just turns 24 months this February and he only say “dada”..Some of my relative said it’s not good sign that my baby can’t talk yet..I told to my family physician 2months ago that he can’t say more words..Doctor told me not to show tv and talk with him all time..But he is very active he don’t want to sit a place he just want to see tv and keep running and playing all time..I don’t feel any problem accepting speech delay..He is very healthy and active baby..what I can do ??"
bQpaMoq-x88,"Adam Khan theres a speech delay class its free paid by ur insurance if not the state pay for it if u dont have insurance. But let me assure u my child is 25th months now and he only say 1 word. That 1 word is daddy :). Anyway I struggle to teach him to say more because hes very moving, he won’t sit still, so i just let him watch TV. Sometimes it takes time, im sure they will be really good at talking around 3 years of age. Just be patience."
bQpaMoq-x88,My baby too but he just started Speech Therapy..He comprehends commands and stuff . He not talking or saying as much. I think he will be a late talker! Just keep at it and take whatever steps needed to help your baby.
bQpaMoq-x88,My three years old is now hitting these 2 year old milestones
bQpaMoq-x88,"@Team Queen’ s Fearn Tucker and Bentley Forever Like I said keep your eyes on them, ALSO they have the trampolines you can purchase that include the safety net around them..."
bQpaMoq-x88,"@Team Queen’ s Fearn Tucker and Bentley Forever Well with that type of mentality no wonder she&#39;s not jumping lol. Trampolines are fine especially if your watching them! Like I said he was 8 months when I put him on there..just sitting down, lightly make him go up and down that&#39;s all...holds hands and jump with them, LIGHTLY....but okay. Just trying to help..."
bQpaMoq-x88,"Try a trampoline, trust me I was putting my son on there at 8 months and he loves jumping now at 2,  improved his balance etc..."
bQpaMoq-x88,@Team Queen’ s Fearn Tucker and Bentley Forever She walks and runs just fine.  Last time we saw her pediatrician she wasn&#39;t concerned but as we approach three I&#39;m a little worried. She does try to jump but she keeps one foot on the ground. I just keep crossing my fingers that she&#39;ll figure it out soon.
bQpaMoq-x88,eatnet <br>How is she now?? Please let me know
bQpaMoq-x88,"Also, I must say my girl knows at least 150 words if not more but never speaks! I mean never ever engage with us using words. Always take my or missus hand to what she wants. As I said she knows every animal on her books, almost all the cards - letters and number with examples (over 100)  and play with toys like NT no problem. Eye contacts and hearing, and motor skills are fine."
bQpaMoq-x88,Haha I think it is more impressive than anything else! Girls seem to pick up language quicker than boys in many cases. She is just a rockstar!
bQpaMoq-x88,"Thank you so much, Tash! Xx"
bQpaMoq-x88,"@Fearn and Tucker’s Angel Forever if you know so much and you&#39;re so smart, what are you even doing here? What is your problem? Coming here and hurting others saying their children are &quot;behind&quot; ? How dare you"
bQpaMoq-x88,"​@Team Queen’ s Fearn Tucker and Bentley Forever No, he&#39;s not. I&#39;ve seen 3 of your comments so far and I can&#39;t imagine what child care course would teach you that children should be speaking in full sentences by 14 months. That&#39;s so far from the AAP guidelines and contrary to the vast majority of experts in the field. If your 14 month old niece is having adult conversations at 14 months (which seems doubtful) then kudos to her, but that&#39;s not the norm. Not even close."
bQpaMoq-x88,That&#39;s amazing!! So fun to watch them grow. :)
bQpaMoq-x88,Point and Perspective <br>How is he doing now?
bQpaMoq-x88,Point and Perspective how is your son doing now
bQpaMoq-x88,"Same,my son just turned 3 and say mama dada,car,cheese,that&#39;s it,he understands everything etc but won&#39;t talk"
bQpaMoq-x88,"@Nekole Amber I have been referred to a speech therapist but the appointment is far off, next January."
bQpaMoq-x88,Thank you so much!! :) Is your son receiving any speech therapy to help progress speech?
bQpaMoq-x88,"Thank you, Natasha! :)"
bQpaMoq-x88,"Thank you, Jayda!! Haha I believe they are from target! The Cat &amp; Jack line has adorable clothes, so we have a lot of their clothes. :)"
bQpaMoq-x88,"my 16 months baby know head, shoulder, knees, toes, nose, mouth, teeth, hair, feet..she pointed all when i asked her..and she can say few words mama dada nana bird duck car ball flower , n can make couple of animal noise..looking forward to watch for more n more new skills every single day.."
bQpaMoq-x88,I know right? It blew my mind too
bQpaMoq-x88,@Andres Brambila I started teaching my child sign language at 6 months (once she held her bottle on her own) and by 7 months she was signing without me asking her to. By 2 years old she was counting to 10 because the daycare she attends would recite the ABCs with her and count 1-10 daily. All toddlers develop at a different pace. You just haven&#39;t been around many toddlers.
bQpaMoq-x88,My daughter is 2 yrs 4 months and can sing the entire alphabet song ! Even the ending lol I cried and was left speechless   she can also count to 10 . <br>I had the DVD &quot;your baby can read&quot; playing since she was 6 months old and before a year old could read some  sight words
bQpaMoq-x88,"Yeah my daughter just did it perfectly today as well, 2 years 2 months old"
bQpaMoq-x88,Thank you so much!! :)
bQpaMoq-x88,Thank you!! :)
bQpaMoq-x88,@Rachel Mabey my son got diagnosed with autism mild to moderate so I guess my worrying was justified
bQpaMoq-x88,@Jennifer cruz update?
bQpaMoq-x88,Omg my son too my son only says hi airplane and like 3 more words he does everything else...this is worrying me
bQpaMoq-x88,"Team Queen’ s Fearn Tucker and Bentley Forever actually you’re wrong. Every kid is different and develops at their own pace, saying that, it’s HIGHLY unlikely a 14 month old will be having “adult conversations”."
bQpaMoq-x88,Sounds pretty typical of kids to do things only when they are motivated to do it. ;)
bQpaMoq-x88,Salma K y
bQpaMoq-x88,Salma K my daughter did the same thing to my partner. I started to take my child to big new social settings.
bQpaMoq-x88,"Hi Salma! So there is a range of normal, of course. It is hard to say one way or another without having more information about your daughter. If you are concerned, and want an OTs perspective I am taking clients for OT consultation sessions. Or you can always mention it to your daughter&#39;s pediatrician. Usually, kids will grow out of that phase; but again, hard to assess without more information."
bQpaMoq-x88,"Awesome!! Keep up the good work, mama!"
bQpaMoq-x88,Thank you!!
bQpaMoq-x88,@Leena Goundar Kai is 26 months in this video 🤍
bQpaMoq-x88,@Nekole Amber pls specify how old is ur son in this video?u don&#39;t seem to answer this specific question everyone is asking.
bQpaMoq-x88,"Hi Brittani! These are the milestones that MOST toddlers are able to do by the age of two. There is a bell curve, so some kids will meet it before two years old and others will meet it after two years old. From my experience with this age, I&#39;ve seen around 3ish months on either side. Hope that helps!"
bQpaMoq-x88,Nathan Medina children in special education have the option to remain in school until 21.
bQpaMoq-x88,I don&#39;t want to sound like a troll but you said children 0-21 but never knew people around 21 were children.
bQpaMoq-x88,"Hi there! I am a pediatric occupational therapist. A large portion of the occupational therapy program is dedicated to child development. I have also been working with this population for about 5 years ranging from treating premature infants in the NICU to children 0-21 years old with typical and atypical development. And of course, I continue to keep up on the latest research and evidence based practices by constantly taking continuing education courses. :)"
bQpaMoq-x88,Thank you!! :)
bQpaMoq-x88,Thank you!!
H_nrKUm2phw,Wow! Yes ☺️
H_nrKUm2phw,"SatanEatsJesus Wow, that is so great for you! I wouldn’t get too excited though.. specifically, she means counting by association (not just knowing the words for the numbers). So, I wouldn’t go bragging to the world about your little “Future Mr or Ms Ivy League” just yet."
H_nrKUm2phw,SatanEatsJesus that’s good that your child knows that but every child is different . And learns at there own pace learn some more about children before commenting something like that .
H_nrKUm2phw,you have to be kidding me
H_nrKUm2phw,My one year old could do tht🤣🤣😉
H_nrKUm2phw,@Chloe Carpenter My 3yr old does that😅😅.he really loves puzzle.
H_nrKUm2phw,"resonantfrequency7125 My cousin could also put together 100 piece puzzles in preschool. His parents thought he would go on to win a Nobel prize or something... That never happened. He did get into chemistry, but not the kind that produces Nobel prize winners... Yup 💉."
H_nrKUm2phw,"Every child develops at their own pace. My 4 year old can do up to 100 piece puzzles on her own as well, but typically she would prefer to do them with someone so we do them together."
H_nrKUm2phw,KM4ZCU what at four years old? That is not believable

C7O0U9OGHew,they said 10 words not 20
C7O0U9OGHew,Damn you got a late bloomer too?
C7O0U9OGHew,Love this comment
C7O0U9OGHew,"That&#39;s nothing, the baby in this video was able to be both 18 months and clearly almost 3 at the same time, beat that!!"
C7O0U9OGHew,Best comment
C7O0U9OGHew,"Weak. My child was pre-accepted into Harvard in the womb and had already achieved all of that, as well as scaling K2 (alpine style, obviously) and pioneering a new cancer treatment, by the time he was three months old."
C7O0U9OGHew,"@Tarredandfeatherable my son is the same way he babbles like crazy and runs every where. He will bring you things if you tell him to give it here or  can i see it or can i have some. He just doesn&#39;t talk, the Dr. has us starting speech therapy because he says my son is supposed to be saying at least 50!!!! words now"
C7O0U9OGHew,"Same here with my boy. climbing, destroying everything. He Closely examines electronics. He can turn his toys off and on- but no spoon. The stupid doc just recommended a speech therapist, because he&#39;s not reciting Shakespeare at  exactly 18 months .   Before this he said he needed a physical therapist to get him to crawl.. well we didn&#39;t listen and now he runs everywhere. My wife is in tears.  Don&#39;t sweat it, its all arbitrary bs. They get kickbacks from referrals to these unnecessary therapists from nervous parents. We read and sing to him.. thats all you can do.  A scared baby is only going to shut down with a therapist  around anyway!"
C7O0U9OGHew,Super smart child
C7O0U9OGHew,How&#39;s your baby doing?
C7O0U9OGHew,Bro same
C7O0U9OGHew,"@Noora Queen what a judgemental comment, she is not “so behind”, all children are different, some don’t talk until 3 years old and it is perfectly normal. As long as they’re doing other things “expected” of their age, then I wouldn’t worry one bit."
C7O0U9OGHew,"Thats fine, just give her time. She will get there :) just pray :)"
C7O0U9OGHew,She’s so behind almost 2 years !!! And only says mama
C7O0U9OGHew,"Doed he point now? Mine is 16 months, doesn&#39;t point but does most of these things."
C7O0U9OGHew,"There is a wide range of normal at this age. My 18 month old knows body parts, but can&#39;t handle a spoon that well, she prefers to use her hands. And she hates drinking from a cup and prefers water bottles. If you&#39;re really concerned ask your pediatrician."
C7O0U9OGHew,"I&#39;d prefer you to ask a Specialist ,"
C7O0U9OGHew,No babies develope at different rates
C7O0U9OGHew,@Jeffy getsm same my son was born with clubfoot and had pop for 8 months(from 1-9 months) now he&#39;s 17 months and he&#39;s not walking or standing on his own yet. It scares me
C7O0U9OGHew,Soha Ali baloch my daughter does all these except walk also and she’s almost 18 months I am worried as well
C7O0U9OGHew,.. Sounds like a past life comment to me!
C7O0U9OGHew,Wow god bless her 🙏🏻
C7O0U9OGHew,I love that you replied because you described our scenario. Be well and safe
C7O0U9OGHew,@Ahmed Masad don&#39;t worry. He is 3.5 years old now and speaks so well. Boys are a little slower than girls sometimes. Just keep it up. Trust me they are absorbing everything you say and do.
C7O0U9OGHew,@Matt NA my son is 18 months now and he is exactly as your son when he was 18 months<br><br>Your comments relieved me a lil as your got better after that I hope my son will start talking soon as well
C7O0U9OGHew,@Matt NA tq for ur quick reply
C7O0U9OGHew,@Sravani❤️✍️ I wrote this a long time ago. My son us turning 3 today and he is fine. His speech picked up very quickly after I kept going with talking to him. I bought a set of DK picture books and kept at it. He is pretty quiet but he has a strong language ability now.
C7O0U9OGHew,"Dont feel like this. My first born was like u say and now at 5 years îs verry ok. The second born, a girl, do all The stuff and more..<br>Not every Child îs The same.!"
C7O0U9OGHew,"Don&#39;t feel bad! Have you checked out Happa Family on YT? She gives helpful tips there. I was worried about my daughter too, and that&#39;s helped."
C7O0U9OGHew,@A B Thank u
C7O0U9OGHew,Thanks for the reassurance 😩😩 My son is definitely speech delayed. He’s smart tho he just doesn’t want to talk.
C7O0U9OGHew,"Kids grow at different rates plz don’t make such videos dishearten you, especially boys are usually 6 months delays vs girls. Once they are 5 year old they catch up to the same rate."
C7O0U9OGHew,@Ghada Ibrahim I&#39;m a mom too and she&#39;s the same size as my 18 month old
C7O0U9OGHew,70% of children who are delayed in language are no longer delayed by age 7! Many kids catch up!
C7O0U9OGHew,"if a child is not meeting a development milestone at a certain age, it doesn&#39;t mean there is something wrong - but there could be.  Going to a doctor can give parents&#39; peace of mind that their child is developing normally, or get the child help if s/he needs it."
C7O0U9OGHew,Kiri Suta thank you for this comment...I’m a bit relieved now
C7O0U9OGHew,Appreciate it
C7O0U9OGHew,I dont have any kids but i am getting ready to babysit a relative&#39;s 18 month old and im super nervous. I watch these videos to know what to expect.
C7O0U9OGHew,I Agree since my sone has startes walking at 17 months
C7O0U9OGHew,"The doctor is not very supportive! You can Google early childhood intervention programs. They can point you in the direction of therapists, O/T, speech etc to work on things. A good paediatrician will help too. You can also get assessments such as autism tests done."
C7O0U9OGHew,Have you talked to your daughters pediatrician? They can refer you to a specialist if needed!
C7O0U9OGHew,@Bhavini patel🧡 now she&#39;s 20 months old. Still cant say a word. But she always babbles as if she&#39;s talking to someone
C7O0U9OGHew,Same my bub is not saying singal word too
C7O0U9OGHew,"Ten words is actually not that many for 18 months, mine says about 50 clear words right now. But all kids are different and I bet ur baby is doing other things that mine isn&#39;t. Don&#39;t let these videos guide you."
C7O0U9OGHew,"Nexus Seven hmmm my 14month old can do the same, but thats normal."
C7O0U9OGHew,@Danetria Jones  hi can we talk and looking for some answers
C7O0U9OGHew,If you don’t mind me asking. What were the results? I am worried my daughter has it but not sure. She sure doesn’t do things that are in this video and she’s 19 months
C7O0U9OGHew,What about now?
C7O0U9OGHew,Take her to see a naturopathic doctor. They helped me tremendously with my 18 mth old whom I suspected of being autistic as well.
C7O0U9OGHew,Her pediatrician she be able to tell you if her behavior is average or not. Take her to her doctor!
C7O0U9OGHew,"When he does that just say no, and move him away from you. Don&#39;t shout, don&#39;t look at him, don&#39;t give him any kind of attention, because that&#39;s all that he wants - attention, it doesn&#39;t matter if it&#39;s positive or negative. When he does something nice, praise him, give him kisses,  so he will learn what he needs to do get your positive reaction :)"
C7O0U9OGHew,Mine does the same
C7O0U9OGHew,Same problem here
C7O0U9OGHew,they learn by watching you
C7O0U9OGHew,@Taylor Nicole Wolfenbarger it&#39;s been a long time  but how did you potty train your baby? I started my son at 14 months. It&#39;s been 2 months and he still doesn&#39;t know when to tell me he need to go potty. He sometimes signals me to change him after he poops his diaper. I feel like it&#39;s so close but im missing something in the training process.
C7O0U9OGHew,"Same as my daughter she is going to be 19 months soon and she would tell me if she need to go toilet.. she can sing ABC song, she knows all the colors and counting numbers also know all the body parts and name animals. I&#39;m so proud of her."
C7O0U9OGHew,Taylor Nicole Wolfenbarger that’s awesome! I have a 16 month old and she is no where near being ready to start.
C7O0U9OGHew,"Misha I started her at 13m, she was showing all the signs to start! Her little sister is due in August so it helps me out big time knowing I would have 2 in diapers."
C7O0U9OGHew,Dang that&#39;s early to be potty trained
C7O0U9OGHew,I have autism and i dont like toddlers
C7O0U9OGHew,"@Barbara Billafon Don&#39;t feel sad Autsim isn&#39;t bad as Y&#39;all seem , Its just kids or people with it takes a lil longer to develop as a normal child would"
C7O0U9OGHew,shell company my son doesn’t speak too and is on the high risk M Chart his evaluation is only in February 😢 and I feel we are loosing precious time!
C7O0U9OGHew,I bet hes easily saysing 10 things not necessarily words..same thing
C7O0U9OGHew,Mydaugher is speak some word andeat herself doing work completely and engage adult but she have less sleeping why
C7O0U9OGHew,pranjal dabhade she’s pretty active. All babies are different!. ❤️ plus if your is a boy they tend to be more adventurous!. 😊
C7O0U9OGHew,how are you going to correct a developmental pediatrician and speech therapist. They have YEARS of experience and degrees.
C7O0U9OGHew,@M. L. i bet he says 10 things..not necessarily words...same thing
C7O0U9OGHew,"My son is 15 months and he does all of that, the only thing he can&#39;t do is saying 10 words, but only 6"
C7O0U9OGHew,"Nah my daughter has been talking since she was 13 months and can speak a full sentence and she is 20months now. She says more than 15 words, knows her body parts (has known them since she was 14 months) can recite the Alphabet without singing it, can count to 17 as of yesterday lol but been counting to 10 for months. The only thing she cant do yet is identify colors but she can say them."
C7O0U9OGHew,Skyler Albrecht she really don’t have to be 2 years old because my baby was doing all of that at 15months of age and everyone was telling me that’s a 2 year old development. And now she’s 17 months when I watch this video I felt so proud of my baby. My daughter was using a lot of words at the age of 1. She was drinking from a cup comfortably at 12 months with good control and no spills And she knew her body parts. She can tell you where is itching lol. We can’t underestimate these kids. They are like modern technology.
C7O0U9OGHew,My son don&#39;t know how drink self
C7O0U9OGHew,"Laxy 99 I don’t doubt it at all, both of my kids have had that size vocabulary at that age. All kids develop at different rates.  No need to call someone a liar."
C7O0U9OGHew,"My daughter is the same way.  Over 100 words, but using a spoon or a cup isn’t happening yet."
C7O0U9OGHew,"Yes definetly!but once they do they speak like a waterfall <a href=""http://lol.my/"">lol.My</a> daughter (18 m.o) used to say only Couple of words in English ,but nowadays she uses  german and in english in her 3 word sentences😊and always points things out in both languages  which pretty impressive to me because she always was such a quiet baby and preferred just to observe haha"
C7O0U9OGHew,I think so. My son only speaks a couple of words in English but he has picked up a word in Chinese. But he understands in both Chinese and English when we tell him to do things.
C7O0U9OGHew,@Jinabi Nij Who is tata then?  :D
C7O0U9OGHew,How is ur baby now? Im wondering . My baby can speak just mama papa tata like tha only
C7O0U9OGHew,Hi hws ur baby now... My baby also not speaking
C7O0U9OGHew,Orpa Nath you could always have them evaluated by a speech therapist if you are concerned.
C7O0U9OGHew,"My 18 month old has just finished her first novel, can pay the guitar and speak 3 languages. I&#39;m not at all smug or conceited like some of the other twats who have commented on here"
C7O0U9OGHew,"My son is 15 months and he does all of that, the only thing he can&#39;t do is saying 10 words, but only 6. I have 5 kids and all of them could do that at that age."
C7O0U9OGHew,Let&#39;s ignore the fact that a lot of parents (BOTH parents) have to work in order to take care of their family&#39;s basic needs... which means we leave our little ones in the hands of other people who may not care for our children the way we do.
C7O0U9OGHew,devilish cat I believe it has to do with parents going on their cell phones and not interacting as well as too much tv when we were children our parents didn&#39;t have smart phones and the only shows were on pbs a couple times a day . I refuse to let my son watch tv at all until he is 2 then he will be able to watch 30 mins a day and I put my phone away whenever I am with him . We also have a learning room that is separate from his room and toy room that we spend 2 hours learning new cognitive skills . I think people just don&#39;t realize the impact cell phones and television can have on their children
C7O0U9OGHew,i agree kids today are regressing i see a 2 year old toddler before asking what is a ballpen and now almost kid i know doesn’t talk much at 2 years old i wonder what happen to the new generation babies
C7O0U9OGHew,Urmila Allavarapu same
C7O0U9OGHew,Yeah. Pretty funny!
C7O0U9OGHew,What age did your baby eventually start talking?
C7O0U9OGHew,I won&#39;t worry much. I cared for boys at this age who are at the same level but all their siblings are normal. They also caught up gradually
C7O0U9OGHew,"My baby is 20 months old and she can  sing songs but her vocabulary consists of naming body parts and mommy, papa(grandpa), papi(dad), mema(grandma). She can not put sentences together and only say a few more words like duckies, ball, mine, baba(sippy cup)"
C7O0U9OGHew,"My baby can sing songs and make small sentences at 18 months. <br>Specially two words ,like its ok,not yet,bless you ,thank you ,oh no,love you"
C7O0U9OGHew,Mine too...and I know someone who&#39;s twins say more 15...I&#39;m a little bit worried
kXyrHLJxFhI,High chair!
kXyrHLJxFhI,My toddler already master all of these skills my the age 3 including finishing 120 pieces puzzles by himselve easily
kXyrHLJxFhI,"Nothing, other than that your child is on track in this area. These are things that children should master at 3, so if they are on track, they will have developed many or all of those skills before they reached the age of 3."
_6uN9egk1HY,instablaster
_6uN9egk1HY,"Excellent Video clip! Excuse me for chiming in, I would appreciate your thoughts. Have you considered - Trentvorty Kids Science Theorem (erm, check it on google should be there)? It is a great one of a kind guide for training your child for success without the headache. Ive heard some awesome things about it and my close friend Aubrey at last got astronomical success with it."
_6uN9egk1HY,"Are you serious? Lab rats are experimented on, not treated. Health sectors have long used the word treat to refer to evidenced based interventions addressing problems and disorders (yes, people have problems and disorders, ALL of us), as have psychologists. I wonder, do you people just sit around trying to find things to be offended about? Wonder what would happen if you used all that energy to actually learn something? 🤔"
_6uN9egk1HY,"You will need to set up a treatment plan with your pediatrician. If in the US, your son needs an IEP - ask the school. ADHD is a learning disability and under the Americans with Disabilities Act the school is legally required to make reasonabke accomodations, which may include measures like reduced homework. Valuable resources include ADDitude magazine and channels from ADHD youtubers like How to ADHD."
_6uN9egk1HY,"Hi Tinika, we are so glad this helped you! Share our video with someone else you think could benefit from this as well"
_6uN9egk1HY,"Thank you, much appreciated"
_6uN9egk1HY,thank you!

8nz2dtv--ok,@Seven Gilbert ditto
8nz2dtv--ok,"Same, but 2 hours before"
8nz2dtv--ok,a comment
8nz2dtv--ok,my teacher asked us to write an essay about this sentence :<br>devise situation that present useful problems and create disequilibrium in the child<br>plz what should i wriite help me 😭😭
8nz2dtv--ok,Kushite.puntite there’s no need to be insulting we’re all learning
8nz2dtv--ok,"Kushite.puntite if you get what I’m saying you don’t need to be so goddamn rude and sarcastic lol. It was very late when I wrote that comment, hit me up if you want to see my transcript"
8nz2dtv--ok,"@Chelsea Defaz I get what youre saying dont get me wrong, just think carefully about wording because even though your message was correct, the phrasing most certainly wasnt. The dude in the video didnt say it like that and I can bet you money your professor didnt say it like that aswell!"
8nz2dtv--ok,@Chelsea Defaz &quot;assuming that infants innately have abilities as 3 months old to know basic physics&quot;  are you sure you passed that class? Or did you misquote your teacher? Let him read that comment of yours
8nz2dtv--ok,"these are early signs of empathy and theory of mind :) it&#39;s incredible, isn&#39;t it? I went through same stuff. Now my daughter is smarter than me :)"
8nz2dtv--ok,Callie Sammeroff yes. His name is Hank Green
8nz2dtv--ok,from US history that is
8nz2dtv--ok,5% gang
8nz2dtv--ok,Don&#39;t be ridiculous the students training to be teachers are watching this too. Let me teach you inclusivity in your assumptions.
8nz2dtv--ok,"Exam in one and a half week, and you couldn&#39;t be more right xD"
8nz2dtv--ok,I&#39;m the 5% cause my school doesn&#39;t have psychology classes
8nz2dtv--ok,95% where y&#39;all at?
8nz2dtv--ok,Hina Jee this is a good speed that gets everything across efficiently
8nz2dtv--ok,There&#39;s an option to slow it down
8nz2dtv--ok,"GANGSTER Studios this is what the people from he journalism group do in school. when they show the bulletin school news, this is what they do. read."
8nz2dtv--ok,Cary how do u know?
8nz2dtv--ok,sephiroth he is reading
8nz2dtv--ok,that&#39;s a good question i&#39;m going to ask my professor this next class and i&#39;ll get back to you!
8nz2dtv--ok,It&#39;s also because the video teaches in a straightforward way. Most professors have to tell you more things and exceptions within each subject because it&#39;s their job to do that so you can understand it fully. I do think that these videos are important to help with a basic understanding but you still should rely on your teachers to get the full picture.
8nz2dtv--ok,Now imagine when this guy was studying there were no crash courses on internet... When I studied philosophy ages ago I did not have internet. And I also doodled and fell asleep sometimes :)
8nz2dtv--ok,Because we as humans learn more efficiently when the way the information is being presented is appealing to us. You&#39;d think schools would have figured that out by now. People would retain a lot more of what they learned about if they did.
8nz2dtv--ok,Because college is a scam.
8nz2dtv--ok,"Well, I&#39;d say it&#39;s because he does simplify it a lot (it is a CRASH COURSE after all), which probably helps. I&#39;m studying this stuff for my exam right now and we have to go into MUCH more detail than that (also I&#39;m a bit sad that Vygotsky is only barely mentioned, but I guess you can&#39;t have it all)."
8nz2dtv--ok,That part!!!
8nz2dtv--ok,Wait... so you mean other people have feelings too?
8nz2dtv--ok,Yupp Freud called it “Primary Narcissism”. also Otto Rank believed “Narcissism as a child.” The book “The Denial of Death.”
8nz2dtv--ok,Literally I was thinking the same thing.
8nz2dtv--ok,Dead on lol
8nz2dtv--ok,7
8nz2dtv--ok,i have nothing to do at 2 am

8nz2dtv--ok,"noni alqa you&#39;re supposed to read, you can&#39;t really learn from a 10 minute vid. His pace is great for recap"
8nz2dtv--ok,no i did too
8nz2dtv--ok,😂😂😂
8nz2dtv--ok,Facts! 🤣🤣🤣
8nz2dtv--ok,"It&#39;s called CrashCourse, not &quot;Thorough Review of the Course&quot;"
8nz2dtv--ok,"oh right, thank you! it bugged me why he looked like him so much."
8nz2dtv--ok,"Nope it&#39;s Hank green , john&#39;s brother"
8nz2dtv--ok,i listen to 1.25 speed btw you are too slow
8nz2dtv--ok,What is senitive period in psychology
8nz2dtv--ok,no it is not
8nz2dtv--ok,+Jenny Lopez good luck is bad to say .
8nz2dtv--ok,Still got 5 more days for IB psych. God I love crash course for cramming.
8nz2dtv--ok,oh
8nz2dtv--ok,@Carrie Press the little cogwheel blow the progress bar chose speed in the menu that shows up and then chose a number less than 1.
8nz2dtv--ok,How do I change the speed?
8nz2dtv--ok,his voice is kinda slow
8nz2dtv--ok,It sounds like he&#39;s drunk.
8nz2dtv--ok,+Richay Bikhari up you go
8nz2dtv--ok,I&#39;m going to call him Gregory
8nz2dtv--ok,"Yeah, tomorrow. Finished studying and now watching this to get the info in another way to cement it in my brain lol"
8nz2dtv--ok,in an hour
8nz2dtv--ok,research paper...kill me...NOW XD
8nz2dtv--ok,Still accurate lol
8nz2dtv--ok,3 years later and you are still right.
8nz2dtv--ok,lol
8nz2dtv--ok,Im now going to laugh while crying im my psych exam. Thank you

8nz2dtv--ok,lucky...
8nz2dtv--ok,+TheYambo121 Yes! EVERYTIME there is a quote on the screen! In every video so far! I don&#39;t know why they did this...

8nz2dtv--ok,Jorge IB exams
8nz2dtv--ok,Yes.
8nz2dtv--ok,"Crash Course is actually part of my personal study &quot;rhythm&quot; lol. I skim over a new chapter to get an idea of what it&#39;s going to be about, I hop over to Quizlet to use flash cards to get my toes wet in the subject (it&#39;s the easiest way for me to quickly understand a basic idea), then I bounce between reading the chapter and Crash Course to expand the basic ideas I learned from the flash cards. I&#39;ve gotten straight A&#39;s doing this, so I definitely  recommend trying it."
8nz2dtv--ok,"Yes, I do. I&#39;m taking some jottings"
8nz2dtv--ok,Literally RN hahaha
8nz2dtv--ok,"I feel ya there, I was the same way. I feel like I developed much faster than my peers, in fact, I don&#39;t even think I ever thought in those childish ways that he explained"
8nz2dtv--ok,Agreed.
8nz2dtv--ok,"Same, I understood things so much easier and quicker and earlier than any of my peers. I must&#39;ve done all my development before the average age for that stage"

8nz2dtv--ok,+Tyrion Lannister I used to think my name was &quot;yours&quot; since everyone always said &quot;this is yours&quot; etc. So then I went around and said &quot;this is yours&quot; when I meant it was mine :P
8nz2dtv--ok,+Tyrion Lannister I think this coming from Tyrion Lannister is very relevant bwahahahah XD
8nz2dtv--ok,@Tyrion Lannister how old were you XD?
8nz2dtv--ok,Uses computer to post angry comment about animisim. Many lulz
8nz2dtv--ok,HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA

8nz2dtv--ok,"@Amanda Marie Pingel Ramsay you&#39;re completely right,while the audio alone isnt all, i too, would enjoy doing mundane tasks whilst listening to these in as a podcast"
8nz2dtv--ok,"@***** +Melk I listen to these while I&#39;m at work, while looking at spreadsheets. When I go back and watch the visuals, I find that the Thought Cafe stuff is super-delightful, but I can testify that it is not necessary to get a lot of value from the videos. <br><br>I second the vote for podcasts; I would love to be able to listen to Crash Course while riding the train or driving across town. "
8nz2dtv--ok,"I know, my bad. "
8nz2dtv--ok,@stylz1<br>It&#39;s a joke jeesh

8nz2dtv--ok,"@URKillingme100 There, now don&#39;t you look silly. Gandhi was also a racist and believed in freedom only for Indians. He didn&#39;t like black people. And MLK misused funds for hooker orgies and occasionally beat them up and plagiarized most of his work.  George Washington&#39;s story about relinquishing his salary leaves out that he instead took an expense account and spent about four times his salary on booze, paid for by taxes. Abe Lincoln did not care about slaves only about keeping the union intact. The more you know."
8nz2dtv--ok,"look into attachment theory, you may be suprised. particularly if you int/ext behaviour is more specific to romantic partners. start with bowlby and work your way forward"
8nz2dtv--ok,"thank you, there is a plethora of research happening right now on everything from parenting to obesity reduction ( and in the one very interesting case a intervention that addresses both) there is no need to focus only on the findings of 1 person. "

8nz2dtv--ok,"Even when I dislike the method, I love crash course."
8nz2dtv--ok,"@IronXC There are a lot of people on YT that don&#39;t cut as much as Hank, though. Many play-throughs don&#39;t have any cuts at all."
8nz2dtv--ok,"He breaths, just tons of cut-scenes."
8nz2dtv--ok,not necessarily 
8nz2dtv--ok,@Ahsan Sayed  Everyone on youtube does this.
8nz2dtv--ok,"There was no jab, I didn&#39;t understand the context of his comment so I stated it. Maybe you were upset by your lack of understanding? "
8nz2dtv--ok,@Khary Robertson And he was just saying that environmental factors matter. :) No need for unnecessary jabs here at CrashCourse :P &lt;3
8nz2dtv--ok,"I am not sure where your statement is based, but environment always plays a huge roll in development, I am just stating that the theories might be understood a little more clearly with the additional knowledge of how neuro-plasticity is involved in the feedback loop that is the growth of knowledge. "
8nz2dtv--ok,"while that&#39;s true, focusing too much on neurological reactions to stimuli tends to ignore the stimuli themselves! understanding the dynamics of the environment and what&#39;s &quot;out there&quot; can also help discern what tools and resources children have available to them."
8nz2dtv--ok,I love there animation I think there cute :3
8nz2dtv--ok,well... at least they&#39;re dancing :D Lol 
8nz2dtv--ok,"the individual attention, eye contact, social interaction, and shared time between an adult (particularly an attachment figure) and a child will always be beneficial. there is some interesting research on eye contact activating the limbic system (stimulating emotional intelligence and empathy). But no you cant force a 2 year old to understand theory of mind, but interacting and exposing children to varied and interesting stimuli will always be a good idea. "
8nz2dtv--ok,"Cognitive development can be sped up, but only to a certain extent. Development isn&#39;t solely cognitive development, but also physical and emotional development, and each that play a role in the overall development in a child. Without the same level of development throughout all stages of development, some concepts may not be fully understood until the levels are in a type of equilibrium with each other."
8nz2dtv--ok,@GTHeavy Y Thanks for the elaborate answer :) It&#39;s intereting :)
8nz2dtv--ok,"The process may be sped up. Vygotsky&#39;s theory essentialy says that culture (and within that - a specific way to raise a child or specific environment) might speed up the stages. The problem is that there&#39;s a ton of variations and interpretations on how to speed it up and what the child actually needs.<br><br>There is no harm in trying to explain complex problems to a child, but you have to have in mind that they might just not get it. It&#39;s not about not trying or not wanting to learn, and even not about not understanding. They just understand things differently.<br><br>However, what might harm a child is unrealistic expectations. A parent is usually around when psychologists test their children (More example questions: what there is more of: roses or flowers/boys or children? Is a rope the same length when it is straight and when it is bent around a corner? ect.), and sometimes they freak out when their child &quot;fails to answer questions as simple as this&quot;. Everything comes at its time."
8nz2dtv--ok,"also adults still do this today, parents think if they explain why tommy hitting timmy hurts timmy&#39;s (which isnt very nice, how would tommy feel??) will make tommy act in a more considerate way. it doesnt. it&#39;s called the little adult assumption and it&#39;s the route cause of a lot of parental head ache"
8nz2dtv--ok,"Furthermore, such theories have allowed us to appreciate the development and natural inability of children to understand certain concepts. Also this allowed us to understand more or less at which stage child should have already developed skills such as theory of mind, so that developmental disorders like autism could be identified and child&#39;s life made easier (for example not punishing it too harshly for lack of empathy)"
8nz2dtv--ok,"It&#39;s not so much that people thought kids thought the same things as adults, but the specific differences between the adult and child types of thinking that was the discovery."
8nz2dtv--ok,Sorry lady but i got ADHD too and i understood it just fine the first time you got no excuse ;D
8nz2dtv--ok,"@Adam Linh, I became a better man not because of others but because of others who care for me and what I didn&#39;t forget, they told me many times, don&#39;t lose your faith and believe what you are fighting for. Only (you) can make a difference, only (you) can change the world to become a better place."
8nz2dtv--ok,"Word, brother. You came out of such a dark time and ultimately became a better person; everything happens for a reason. I feel absolutely sorry for those that can&#39;t even grasp their mind around coexisting with other humans of different backgrounds. Consider yourself far above those people, probably farther than you yourself could imagine."
8nz2dtv--ok,"In the end I reckon there will be no single framework for understanding the human mind that is even 70% &quot;correct&quot; or even quantifiably &quot;wrong.&quot; The standard deviation might be less for a single model for a specific case, but that&#39;s it. I&#39;d be happy to find a model that helps me understand just 50% of my kid&#39;s behaviour."
8nz2dtv--ok,"I have a Bachelor&#39;s degree in Linguistics and find lots of issues with Chomskyan definitions of grammar. He laid a good framework, but its far from being 100% correct. A decent linguistics program should have taught you that.<br><br>Also, Vygotsky was one of the early champions of a social constructivist theory to language which is DEFINITELY not one dimensional."
8nz2dtv--ok,"Okay, that makes sense. Thank you! "
8nz2dtv--ok,"You&#39;re comparing apples and oranges. Human language is far more complex than animal communication.<br><br>Children are not born with all the phonemes of the world in their head or we would all speak all the languages (or one super language, depending on how you look at it.) Some theorists believe we have the mechanisms to put it all together intrinsically inside of us, but we still need to hear the phonemes spoken aloud in order to know which are correct and how they are formed into words. As a baby goes from crying to trying to replicate these phonemes, it often comes across to us as just babbling, until they get the correct input and affirmation as to what sounds are correct sounds/words and what sounds are not correct sounds/words (correct in the sense of real, not proper)."
8nz2dtv--ok,also young children tend to look longer at things that they recognize than things that are ambiguous
8nz2dtv--ok,"my guess is that kids tend to get caught up with single specific traits when viewing something, like how in conservation tasks kids are distracted by length/height. So maybe each time they watch they notice something different than before?"

8nz2dtv--ok,"I&#39;ve seen people talk about the model of Bi-polar over reaction, that&#39;s cool. But theirs also an inhibition factor to this as well. People with bi-polar just experience all the same emotions we all do at a much higher and more frequent rate depending on their sub-type.  Now ADHD is commonly confused with Bi-polar simply because of the frequency of outbursts due to a lacking ability to inhibit behavior. They experience the same level of emotions we all do, however they act on them in their raw form with no inhibition."

zugBuwgLgcc,"Hi Daima,<br><br>What I normally do with my daughter who just turned 2, is to invite her to help me with the household work. I have a learning tower so she can see me when I am cooking while doing some activities. I know as mothers we can sometimes be focused on the tasks at hand. However, involving my daughter in the household has helped me tremendously. I hope this helps, but I know you are doing an amazing job!!"
zugBuwgLgcc,"Hey hi! I did the same unknowingly. And let me tell you it has been 15 days since no tv.. n he is a lot active. He is walking, playing puzzles and overall involved with us. I think it is working"

zugBuwgLgcc,I think this is fine. As it&#39;s familiar faces he knows. I think that personalization is great. My concern is more tv shows/cartoons this young that are not personalized to the child
zugBuwgLgcc,"Thank you so much for this feedback. This is a new venture for me, so I appreciate the encouragement"
zugBuwgLgcc,@PedsDocTalk TV Please share once u have it ..mine is 2 wks younger to Ryaan . :-)
zugBuwgLgcc,I will try to find a list of these. I want to compile a list of my favorite tv shows as Ryaan gets older!
zugBuwgLgcc,"Thanks for watching, Hemali!"
zugBuwgLgcc,"I also have the same concern. my 18 month old has become non verbal and even shows signs of autism. we believe this is also due to too much screen time. would you be able to show us ways on how to concretely help reverse the effects? the good news is that in just 5 days of pure (almost unrelenting) face to face contact with him, he is now more able to maintain eye contact and even less violent tendencies (he acts out when he gets frustrated). please, if you have any information on this, it would be a life saver! 🙏"
zugBuwgLgcc,"@runswiththecurls Youre so welcome! i had a convo with a parent today about this. Hes a physician and uses screens and he said exactly what I said, &quot;We enrich her in other ways and she is so busy at school learning that an extra hour isnt harmful.&quot; I agree, that it really depends on the QUALITY for interactions happening outside of screen time"
zugBuwgLgcc,Thank you for this reassurance! Love all the advice you give :).
zugBuwgLgcc,"I do! I talk about this in the video with balancing, especially in the pandemic. For example, you use screens so you can get something done but when screen time is over, there is quality time with your children. In my opinion, this can be protective in that the child is getting enrichment. I look at screens like containers (swings, activity centers, etc). We can use them, but they really should be in a balance with other activities. Also, in this pandemic, screen time is increasing due to lack of childcare help/parent working from home. I dont worry of life-long damage to kids. Just a conversation of how we can balance &quot;the rules&quot; with what works for our own individual situation."

3EyvaEk0K-k,@bluffgg 😂😂 &quot;good story&quot;.When I mention things that are happening in my life now to people they just look at me like I am crazy and ask me if I am joking.Even if it&#39;s norm stuff I told a girl at my school about my dad getting shot outside my window and how my friend got shot and she said&quot;is this a try story? Or...&quot; She mostly avoids me now.
3EyvaEk0K-k,"@xahsinor im sorry to hear that. Well im not sure what im supposed to say but there is hope, there is hope trust me things get better. Just believe in yourself that you can do it.

3EyvaEk0K-k,@docbansky im sorry to hear what you&#39;ve gone through. How are you right now?
3EyvaEk0K-k,Please tell me you’re out of that environment
3EyvaEk0K-k,With therapy and social workers for both parent and child traumas through the world
3EyvaEk0K-k,"Lauren Simon I agree, BUT without the ENVIRONMENT they are in to be as much nurture, feedom, normal as ANY child; it sends mixed messages, as does the environmental factors of psychotropics and non constant staff/drs coming in for their paid visits, not treating the child as a human value to give consistent love. ALL environmental variables need to be consistent refufe sanctuary that all other children have, to not isolate and demeanor the soul, mind, body dignity of the child.<br><br>Also, as I did provide refuge to abused children, WITH animals they were freely allowed to bond with, without me ever forcing my own interactions or making them talk; each child first went into a rage, that I did not reject not punish then; then fell into a infantile stage thru each development stage where I recreated the neuronal pathways by nurturing each to rebuild the pathways to their appropriate age development <br><br>Only when state system came in, did any re regress as all valuable trust bonds and environmental refufe sanctuary was taken away and destroyed, violating the child&#39;s sacred trust and dignity, yet again, by the big system of PAID peeps. All I did, I did for free."
3EyvaEk0K-k,"Abusive people usually know the consequences of their actions, but they don&#39;t give a frick, especially if they&#39;re narcisistics."
3EyvaEk0K-k,Abused children become abusive  parents.
3EyvaEk0K-k,Abusive parents usually know the consequences of abusing their children but they don’t care.
3EyvaEk0K-k,"Yes i can agree to that... My parents are pure heterosexuals.... Because of the physical abuse and trauma they did to me i resulted to become attracted to the same sex i think thats what happens to almost 60% of gay people before they knew their sexuality i mean i am not the bad type of gay... I can accept everyone whoever they are as long as they are kind people and because of the result of the abuse they gave me i have been pretty friendly with girl children because i grew up being secretly friends with girls and stuff because my parents would beat me if they knew i was a &quot;gay&quot;..... I hid my true personality from my whole family,relatives etc.... Because they all despised gay people and they would torment me for being gay because I am very weak and emotional......so i acted straight for 16+ years until i lived by my own......  I also had a rule stuck to my head to &quot;Whatever child I might have in the future or if i adopt one, I will never inflict the same pain my parents has done to me&quot; im scared i might become a bad parent i just hope i wont"
3EyvaEk0K-k,EVERY SINGLE HUMAN BEING SHOULD
3EyvaEk0K-k,"Perhaps everyone should. I&#39;ve seen people who can hardly take care of pets properly, considering them to be disposable toys. What would surprise me about their inability to care for their children? This from years of being a nurse and more years of being a HUMANE, compassionate person who understands that food, love, and shelter are the very basics to start with and then move along to more important issues that should be obvious but seem to be mentally missing from the minds of way too many folks with children. You have to have a license to hunt or fish but anyone can pop out a &quot;unit&quot; and treat it with disdain and sometimes not treat them appropriately at all! Yes, I heard a parent refer to her kids simply as useless units that she never wanted but she fed because she had to according to the law. She wouldn&#39;t allow them to be adopted into a family who wanted them but eventually, that&#39;s what did indeed happen. Yeah, not like that was much of a surprise, really!"
3EyvaEk0K-k,"Saul Andres  yes, as all these systemic staff get profit as put abused kids on psychotropics that imprison their mind and soul and label them for life, including in their electronic med records...the ABUSERS get off, with no label, often no public press that NAMES them....but a person with some pot or minor offense gets more costly punishments and charges. <br>IF, any that work in any area of these systems TRULY CARED, they would be lobbying for abusers to be locked up, put on psychotropics drugs and their lifestyle, names, reputations and freedoms destroyed, not the child. Such a ruthless farce..."
3EyvaEk0K-k,@anime addict yes please
3EyvaEk0K-k,"Maybe as they try to humiliate children with signs around neck walking in public areas they should do the same. Sadly the most sadistic abusers vare those we pay at the very top. Sometimes uta better to get those cool tree climbing shoes w spikes to help get up and rather cut from bottom w rope and yell TIMBER. slowly as s group of considerate kind nin violet screaninf beings slowly climb each group aka branch hmmm as needed and get to the top and just surprise them as hello sorry you gots to to and start cutting from the top. Then rhe rest if us whom possibly afraid of heights!! Can collect these dead branches and watch as we work our way down as now they are stuck cant go up as they are gone nor down as they pissed on those below then already. And can&#39;t swing left or right. Nice analogy I feel I will write down as never viewed it before as such. But I recently was talking about those cool spike shoes! God source whomever you choose to say. As long as it&#39;s one if love kindness compassion fairness as humans. Not speaking animals as one needs to kill or harm the other for survival of life as seems the general majority of us have known this and only when the true minority 1% has forced us as if we are their puppets some esp particular groups or communities which btw they (the minority ) created get back to fear and  survival mode bc as anyone of us xan easily be turned when we see iurbjuds cry drin hunger. Our loved ines shot and killed by eachother, or worse by those whom are here to protect and serve actually do the opposite as many hide behind their illusion of power regardless of the level where it is actually the worst crimes committed by the illusion of protection &amp;  power they thought they have and took but when we are shaken by the very beautiful earth who feeds and provides all of our needs( not them) and we re connect as once before such disgusting genocide occured and still is this very day. They will fear us. And they should B.C. the control power hungry narccistc beings whom we need cut down from the top will feel their true powerlessness and insecurities and esp vulnerability. That&#39;s their fear. I know it&#39;s hard for them to open their own door let alone sweat at work( not bx fear of being fired or jail) and grow own food and hope we do not decide to go to their shunned communities and say. Ok time to give us half and say it&#39;s for your safety we can&#39;t tell you what or whom we share ut with...in time we shall see major shifts ans changes which will result in benefiting those who it was indeed meant to! May peace and love be with us all!"

Either way I’m glad you resolved it and I hope you don’t get a drinking habit out of this, you have so much life to live free from stress and anxiety. You’ve finally been given the honour you deserve don’t let them still win by affecting your health in this way"
3EyvaEk0K-k,Did U have sesuires because of anxiety?
3EyvaEk0K-k,"My dad was abusive and a cop. When my mom finally had the courage to call the cops on him, he got arrested and I was relieved until he came out the next morning. It was worse after that. He started playing mind games after beating my siblings and mom. When I became an adult and finally had the courage to tell him how it made me feel witnessing all of that, he used his mind games again saying I was lying and I’m crazy and that he never did that. Social workers came to our house in the past and instead of questioning us in our home where my dad recorded everything, they should of just locked him up for good."
3EyvaEk0K-k,"I think, perhaps, she is referring to the US child protection system. This is based on the context in which she is commenting."
3EyvaEk0K-k,that may be true but keeping them in the house with the abusers will be the last option you can&#39;t put them back with the same thing that diagnose the problem
3EyvaEk0K-k,"And just who is &quot;The System&quot;?  So many people without the educational background to judge tend to get into that &#39;Trendsucking&#39; mentality of the fact that we live in a &quot;Society of Blame&quot;.  However, if you&#39;ve got the bones to back up your statements, please.....let us know.  Jozelle, LCSW, RN."
3EyvaEk0K-k,"Therapy can be really helpful, but also checking in with yourself about how you are feeling. Showing up for yourself when you are vulnerable, and sitting with the emotions can be helpful, it’s not easy, but it is possible. But sometimes being present with your trauma can be extremely triggering so having some professional support can be extremely helpful. Also something that has helped me is reconnecting with the parts of myself that I felt I lost because of the trauma. I’m really sorry you had to go through this, and I hope you’re feeling ok. You’re doing a great job with your healing."

BxORL0nYcOc,Hi Nessa. You are most welcome! 😊
BxORL0nYcOc,@Mister Simplify thank you so much .stay blessed ❤️
BxORL0nYcOc,Hi Bint. I will think about the topic you suggested for sure. Cheers!
BxORL0nYcOc,Cheers! :)
BxORL0nYcOc,"That&#39;s why developmental and epigenetic psychologists also recognize the value in Erik Erikson&#39;s Pysco-social Stages of Development.  There are recent and groundbreaking advances during the past decade in detecting certain genetic allelles that, in a complex manner, are activated depending on how adverse their environment is.  My opinion is that, while not perfect, Erikson&#39;s stages of Psycho-social development account for the variability in the cognitive-emotional development of a balanced spectrum of empathy vs. psychopathy/sociopathy. The environment provides a lot more to the equation than once thought.  The future of psychology, in my opinion, lies in the hybridization of disciplines, what I term as epigenetic neuropsychology."
BxORL0nYcOc,"Wow! That&#39;s a very interesting insight, Rod. Understanding child development and psychology made you play it smart. I won&#39;t be surprised if his progress is faster now."
BxORL0nYcOc,"Hi Romulan. I understand what you mean. This point has however been debated as a critique in a few studies I&#39;ve come across. So I used it as a popular criticism pointer. If you want to explore this further, here are a couple of papers quoting this criticism are as follows:<br>Schaffer, HR. (2004). Introduction to Child Psychology. Oxford, UK: Oxford University.<br>Smith, PK., Cowie, H., Blades, M. (2003). Understanding Children&#39;s development (4th Ed.). Oxford, UK: Blackwell Publishing Ltd."

BxORL0nYcOc,Hi Marieke. Yes Cognitive development is also referred to as Intellectual development
BxORL0nYcOc,Awesome! Thank you! :)
BxORL0nYcOc,Hi Moseleen. Yes it does. They understand that people can go out of sight or out of the house and later return. They realise from experience that people don&#39;t &#39;get deleted&#39; if they aren&#39;t around.
BxORL0nYcOc,Thank you! I hope you and your loved ones stay safe and healthy!

r6_nindqsTs,"That sucks. I’m so sorry your father treated you so badly, for something that you had no choice in. Some people can be so disgusting and so cruel. I hope you had the opportunity to receive help to be able to process your childhood trauma. My heart goes out to you, I’m glad to hear that you understand the reason for his unnecessary cruelty, I imagine that must be a small comfort to you to know that none of his behavior was your fault, but his own sick twisted way to feel better about himself and what he felt was your mother’s betrayal, and than apparently his insecurities involving his spouses marital infidelities. I also help your mother tried to defend you, but in my experiences coaching people through trauma (I am not a professional, just a passionate volunteer, who has lived through some traumas, and was fortunate enough to have a dedicated team of medical professionals and therapists who spent years treating my substance use problem as well as my thinking errors, (maladaptive thinking), and many emotional issues, I lived most of my life. I wish you the best, and I believe that people like us that have trauma, always have the ability to change their lives, since our brains have plasticity, meaning the ability to change, the more often we have certain healthy and unhealthy thoughts and behavior the easier it is for our brain to recreate those thoughts and behavior. I wanted to let you know that the more you learn about your self and your childhood trauma, and the more therapy and time you give your self will be so life changing, although in the beginning of treatment you may feel worse especially if you avoided many bad memories, thoughts, and feelings for so many years, but eventually you will find peace and be able to heal. It&#39;s what our brains and bodies are designed to do. Anyway, I&#39;ll stop rattling on, and I hope your get the opportunity to heal, and be able to love your self and make peace with your past. Not forgive for his benefit, but so you can stop hurting,  and one day you will be free of many of the negative feelings and emotions you have been made to feel for so many years. It will be a hard road, or at least is was for me, I still rock and cry for days, but I have hope and less suicidal incidents than I used to. I wish you the best. God bless you, take care of your self, learn about your conditions that we&#39;re the result of the abuse, and keep trying to find a person you feel 100% comfortable to talk to. Remember your worth it, and fuck shame cause none if it was your fault, even though our sick brains try to trick us into believing that."
r6_nindqsTs,I&#39;m not sure if you&#39;re a Christian but write a letter to Jesus - tell him all of it... how it made you feel - EVERYTHING... and see how He helps you
r6_nindqsTs,@ GyK G yeah yeah you got yelled at when you cost your poor overwhelmed broke mother what little money she had to feed you WaWa so it’s al mommy’s fault where was daddy and you do see that you are a grown as man right?

r6_nindqsTs,"@Mardi Shores how would you know that Jesus doesn&#39;t heal these issues if you&#39;ve never asked Him? <br>The way you disrespect the people who say that God has helped them,  by discounting their experience,  shows you as a selfish,  entitled person. Being abusive can&#39;t be blamed on others. It comes from a bad attitude. You could do with some soul searching instead of allowing yourself to behave badly."
r6_nindqsTs,@Jo Greene how did you get to this idea?
r6_nindqsTs,@Mardi Shores bless you friend
r6_nindqsTs,@Joy Always YOU ARE DELUSIONAL! LOL.
r6_nindqsTs,"@Mardi Shores and that&#39;s the beauty of it all Mardi, Jesus takes our mess and makes us His family. Please ask Him, He really does love us, deeply! And He loves making beauty from ashes, give Him those ashes!"

r6_nindqsTs,@Edward De La Detroit ‘living well is the best revenge’ - George Herbert
r6_nindqsTs,"@Neil 72                                    <br>It is a big reason yes. I would say its possibly the biggest problem. Not the only, but definitely a major one. One that really really needs more attention in all fields. But i just have to correct you. Adults don&#39;t grow up. Kids grow up, (Hopefully) many never do. many children walking around in adult bodies right now. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I think the child&#39;s spirit is always needed and should never be let go of. It&#39;s a very Layered matter. See because I see children as more honest, brave, loving, and intelligent than most adults I&#39;ve met. So I&#39;m not knocking kids, please believe me. But then there is another part to it,  which is that the human soul must evolve. Children must grow up to become adults, masters of their own destinies. But when you abuse someone, or are abused, you severely sever that connection between that person and the Divine(In my opinion) and hence force impact negatively their ability to grow mentally and spiritually. So yes, adults &#39;should&#39; just be children who have grown up into their maturity and independence as a self sufficient individual who has not left behind the love, imagination and potential of the child&#39;s soul, spirit, and mind.... But have included and integrated it into their newfound adulthood. But sadly this happens rarely in today&#39;s world. We need to change this. Yes WE!!!!Evil is not Born. Its made. Its a figment of our collective imagination. A Figment that hurts our men women and children but a figment non the less. Because it can be defeated. we created it and we can control it."
r6_nindqsTs,"not only children, every person who experienced abuse"
r6_nindqsTs,"@Lori Miller I suffered this my whole life, I always felt like a Burden to my family, my mom was abusive verbally and physically my dad too, my mom never hugged me or asked me if I was okay or how my school was or my day, never."

r6_nindqsTs,Presence doesn&#39;t mean present.
r6_nindqsTs,"Fedora, I love your comments and know you&#39;d be a great mom... one thing I don&#39;t agree with though...my mom always stayed at home, never had an outside job and the abuse was horrible"

r6_nindqsTs,"It&#39;s not in the best interest of the pharmaceutical companies to have people well.  Pharmaceutical companies donate lots of money to politicians.

r6_nindqsTs,Who do you think fights in those wars
r6_nindqsTs,Our government want this to happen to us. The evidence is all around us. They know exactly how to completely destroy the human spirit. And then pretend to care about us. It&#39;s an EPIDEMIC. Don&#39;t think it&#39;s not planned.

I cry a lot too, most think I am just soft or weak, but even if I told anyone, why, it really is just a waste time. I can understand some of your pain, but certainly you had it extra rough than most."
r6_nindqsTs,"Your family and parents were sources of pain and suffering. Wanting to stay away from them is a normal reaction, and you are, maybe without fully realizing it, protecting yourself. May I suggest the book &quot;Dianetics :The Modern Science of Mental Health&quot;?<br>Dianetics allowed me to get over the death of my mother in about 3 to 4 hours, after suffering for about 3 years. There may be a Dianeticist close to where you live."

r6_nindqsTs,"+Hannah Gao They can be undone in most cases, in my opinion. Brain plasticity, self awareness and treatment play an important part of healing from ACE&#39;s. I was abused as a child by narcissistic parents and for the past two years have been making steady progress in healing myself from PTSD/C-PTSD. There is hope."
xTra-yePY_A,I wouldn&#39;t use the words child abuse ipn this context. You obviously weren&#39;t taught discipline in your childhood
xTra-yePY_A,"austin schuchmann there may not be a study, however it’s common sense. People who’re smart and work hard make money (bonus if you’re a creative risk taker who makes a business). People who’re ignorant and lazy may job bounce, fail to progress in a company, or live off the welfare state. <br>Your maximum intelligence capacity is determined by genetics. However, your ability to reach this maximize capacity is determined by your environment and I will grant that that does add some nuance to this situation, however it most certainly is possible to raise a child in a lower class area that goes on to be very intelligent, or the other way around. As for personality, some of it may be genetic, but for the most part personality is shaped by experiences. It could turn out just like the parent, the opposite, or in the middle"
xTra-yePY_A,"What is your source for that data. It as no backing, therefore is false"
xTra-yePY_A,YES. Human connections have a far greater positive impact.
xTra-yePY_A,"Ever watch what passes for children&#39;s entertainment these day?  Some programs have no words at all.  Sponge Bob is horrible.  Everyone has super powers.  Incredibly stupid.  Kids have already sat through thousands of hours of this drivel by the time they are 5, and those lost years were the years their brains were developing the fastest in their entire lives.  Think of how much more they would know and how much better their emotional stability would be if instead someone read stories or played with them instead.  Notice so many child prodigies come from the orient?  It&#39;s because families over there really invest in their children."
xTra-yePY_A,"Another TED talk showed that only real human conversation or talk to babies who can&#39;t yet talk have an effect in stimulating the brain growth, not merely watching TV.  But of course, if it&#39;s a child of a certain age, say 5 (who we assume can understand podcast) that might be a different story.  That&#39;s the idea of a social brain."
xTra-yePY_A,"She`s not only scientist, she`s a woman"
xTra-yePY_A,"Didn&#39;t we try this already?  IT&#39;s called welfare.  LBJ&#39;s blight on minorities.  Made generations of otherwise hard working black families (there was no difference of single motherhood pre-LBJ btwn black and white families) into gov&#39;t dependent single mother families.  I&#39;m for free education, college included for under privileged kids, but not for just handing out money.  Free job training?  Yes, but not free money.  I don&#39;t think they do this even in Nordic countries.  Welfare on steroids; incentivizing dysfunction."
xTra-yePY_A,"@Kappa Kappa Yep, it would be great if money could buy stability and proper cognitive development, but I&#39;m pretty sure you said it right with regards to supporting factors.  I think those &quot;other&quot; factors will, in the end, be just as important as the direct effective influence of money alone.  I know one thing, it is refreshing to have an intelligent dialogue with someone in the comments section."
xTra-yePY_A,"coco isk take everything you hear with a grain of salt. She said it doesn’t always have to be the case. Just have conversations with your baby as if they were talking back. If income is a problem, try to get government assistance, or try to diversify your income in a few different ways."
xTra-yePY_A,"@Kappa Kappa my point is this: children growing up in poverty/social housing will inevitably encounter more negative experiences than that of their wealthier counterpart simply because of the environment they grow up in. I don&#39;t think giving away more money is a viable solution but maybe more strict guidelines around the types of social housing/demograpic poverty stricken children are being allowed to grow up in. Designate some buildings for families and single parents with children only and if theyre caught doing drugs or abusing alcohol or their children, or bringing inappropriate people around they&#39;re reprimanded or evicted. I&#39;m not trying to down play the astronomical effects solving poverty would have, but having family friendly housing available for those financially struggling families would go a long way in helping people solve their own poverty problems."
xTra-yePY_A,"@Kappa Kappa My point is that they didn&#39;t provide the mothers with financial stability, so they cannot study the effects of financial stability."
xTra-yePY_A,"How many ipads per month did she need? Easy peasy, give moms an ipad AND this money."
xTra-yePY_A,"That&#39;s not something they&#39;re attempting to control with this study.  But there&#39;s reason to believe that most mothers, given extra income, would spend some of that income on their kids, or be able to spend more time with their kids, or be under less stress, and that would benefit their kids. <br><br>Also, it&#39;s worth noting that a variety of social programs are designed to make sure that money is spend on very particular things. Medicaid money has to be spent on healthcare. SNAP and WIC must be spent on food, sometimes particular foods. Housing assistance goes directly to landlords. It has to be spend putting a roof over your (and your kids&#39;) head."
xTra-yePY_A,Interesting and children aren&#39;t benefiting sad.
xTra-yePY_A,"The money can be used in any way; mothers could buy what they want and spend no money for their children. This study does not investigate what will happen if money for children is given to poor families, I am guessing. Previous studies suggest that parents&#39; emotional states can affect their children&#39;s cognitive abilities, so if mothers are just happy, their children would get better abilities in the process of development."
xTra-yePY_A,The randomness  probably gives the study more credibility  because I&#39;m sure that not every middle class household that they are being compered to  puts there kids first  either .
xTra-yePY_A,"Rich people pay more in taxes than anyone else, ever heard of the pareto principle? Or even LOOKED it up? Capitalism is why we are all living on more than $1 a day, and obesity is a bigger problem than starvation."
xTra-yePY_A,@Kappa Kappa : We all want the best for these folks and their children.  We&#39;ll see what the results of the study brings. I was just surprised that usually TED talks of this kind mentions the results of a finished study.
xTra-yePY_A,"@Kappa Kappa : You can &quot;intend&quot; all day till the cows come home, but without any restrictions put on the money, and no way to enforce said restriction,s if there were to be any, it&#39;s just wishful thinking.  This is a scientific study, right?  Not some quasi &quot;social&quot; science study?  You may intend to cure cancer, but without results, all you have are intentions which means squat."
xTra-yePY_A,"@Kappa Kappa : Does it matter whether the study &quot;intends&quot; the money for children or not?  The money is given &quot;to parents&quot; right?  Does the study put any restriction on how the money should be spent?  No.  Just lots of wishes and intentions at this point, and &quot;logical assumptions&quot; which you claim are important, but also claim not to make any.  We&#39;ll see."
xTra-yePY_A,"@Kappa Kappa : I did see all of the video just to see if there were any conditions put on the free money, like job training, addiction counseling etc. but there were none.  Your &quot;common sense&quot; is obviously not my common sense.  My belief that the study will come out badly is that they are basically incentivizing dysfunction.  I&#39;m for free college education for underprivileged kids and free job training, free addiction programs, but NOT just handing out money.  If you are poor in the US, there is a significant dysfunction existing, and the way to fix that is education and job training, and counseling, and telling ppl to not have kids before finishing  college or vocational training, a guarantee route to life time of poverty for you and your kids."
xTra-yePY_A,"@Kappa Kappa :  Yes, it&#39;s a proposed study the results of which have yet to come out.  Never ASSUME.  If you ASSUME you make an A$$ out of U and ME, the great sage Benny Hill once said."
xTra-yePY_A,@AAA James Bond can be measured close enough.

xTra-yePY_A,"Yeah, your observation based on a stereotype that doesn&#39;t take into account other factors where you didn&#39;t even bother to collect any actual data just destroys well-controlled scientific research. Here&#39;s your Nobel Prize. There&#39;s more things wrong with this argument than I care to count."

xTra-yePY_A,"I work in a warehouse and the Polish are by far the hardest workers there, it makes my wonder what cultural differences from the UK make them such a strong working force."
xTra-yePY_A,that&#39;s just anecdotal thought. looking at the data shows how Poverty/Income relates in the bigger picture.
xTra-yePY_A,@Ben Briggs <br>that&#39;s just your Prejudicial thinking saying that though. you still need to be Financially safe to be able to do those type of things with some success. the reason Money is being proposed is because it gives them more opportunities to focus on other things that can improve their lives rather than just always worrying about have enough of it for basic needs.
xTra-yePY_A,"@NATURAL LAW I understand quite well.  I do not think that money is the best solution or even in the top ten.  How about a program that addresses nutrition or education or financial advisors to help with budgeting.  Those are just 3 ideas of the top of my head in 20 secs. that would be better ideas than the idea she is proposing.<br><br>Edit:  I have always been poor and I used to have a gambling problem.  Guess what I&#39;d do with that money, 5 yrs ago, if an agency just handed me $300 a month.... nothing useful."
xTra-yePY_A,@Ben Briggs <br>I think you&#39;re misunderstanding things a bit. it&#39;s not about the end game per se. but just about improving their situation and giving them better chances at succeeding.
xTra-yePY_A,@Ben Briggs <br>Exactly my thoughts.
xTra-yePY_A,@Osiran rebel  it&#39;s almost as if one factor cant explain people and the way there life turns out.  That&#39;s why this talk is garbage and over simplistic.
xTra-yePY_A,you&#39;re right it&#39;s not set in stone but it&#39;s still a major factor in the grand scheme of things.
xTra-yePY_A,"Very interesting to hear that this study worked well. It does make sense though. More money = more educational opportunities for said children, more books to read etc."
xTra-yePY_A,Vernice Thompson People praise Reagan. They loved his personality and speeches. They don’t realize what his policies were or how they damaged us. 😢
xTra-yePY_A,Stupid people tend to be poor and tend to have stupid kids. How strange.
xTra-yePY_A,​@NietzscheanMan Also calling people &quot;stupid&quot; when you can&#39;t even put proper sentences together or capitalize properly makes you look like a hypocrite.
xTra-yePY_A,@NietzscheanMan You don&#39;t have any proof of that and stereotypes are rarely true. Anyone who says &quot;It&#39;s a stereotype because it&#39;s true&quot; doesn&#39;t know how the world works. Also most the taxes don&#39;t come from people who worked hard for their money. They come from rich people who were born into money and make money just by existing. This woman has actual proof based on science and you have conjecture. Plus your username suggests you&#39;re a fan of Nietzsche. I honestly can&#39;t take anyone who likes his load of trash seriously.
xTra-yePY_A,"If your family needs financial support, does that not make them poor? Then should you not give your family money as they will gamble it away?"
xTra-yePY_A,"@MrThatGuyYouForgot poor people waste money, it&#39;s a stereotype because it is true even though you may have individual outliers. Who cares are the people who get stolen from to give their hard earned savings to people who will waste it, instead of helping their own family with it. The experiment has beenndone with decades, welfare makes people dependent voting cattle and that is the point of the whole program. Don&#39;t feed the animals the signs say, and it is the same for people for the same reasons."
xTra-yePY_A,@Quagom. I&#39;ve been through comments and can&#39;t find your links. Was it in reply to someone else?
xTra-yePY_A,Charlotte Scott I posted two links in one of my previous comments.
xTra-yePY_A,@Quagom That is interesting- can you point me to that research?
xTra-yePY_A,@Quagom <br>why did they &quot;disappear&quot;?
xTra-yePY_A,"The thing is that the IQ advantage they gained because of increased income and/or education tends to dissipate as they become adults. By the time they are fully grown up, those extra IQ points have totally disappeared."
xTra-yePY_A,"URTISK : opulence can offer peace of mind but it doesn’t determine achievement ,if the rich go looking for the pleasures in life and the poor who stay up all night studying by the candlelight,who’s going to be more successful?

xTra-yePY_A,"This is about poverty affecting physical characteristics of children&#39;s brains, not about their admittance to an Ivy League school."
xTra-yePY_A,"It&#39;s neither of those.  All children, including middle-class children can suffer impaired brain development too, if their early years don&#39;t feature an abundance of love, attention, talking-to, show-and-tell, question-and-answer.  Human interaction in a safe, supportive, loving environment.  The work on this has largely been done by Early Child Development researchers, and their findings are solid and credible."
xTra-yePY_A,Systemic Environmental components are indeed the biggest influences in all of this.
xTra-yePY_A,because it still takes a Healthy Environment to be able to develop those things.
xTra-yePY_A,That does not fit the communist narrative.

xTra-yePY_A,@MrWombatty Great point!
xTra-yePY_A,"Totally agree! One important factor not mentioned is how poverty is detrimental to good nutrition, &amp; although Kimberly Noble did mention a couple of environmental factors like exposure to lead &amp; passive smoking , generally poor people can only afford to rent housing in areas that more likely to be affected by air-pollution on a daily basis (ie; close to major roads &amp; industry), which are proven factors in slow development in children!"
xTra-yePY_A,"@noredcr Most UBI proposals are $6k - $12k per year for every adult. Would you really quit your job and live on that? And even if you did, people who still work will have a much better standard of living than you."

xTra-yePY_A,@NietzscheanMan  😀😁
xTra-yePY_A,"@krishnan srinivasan intimidation has nothing to do with it, what are you talking about. Shows why you want ubi, perhaps the feelings of inadequacy are justified. Don&#39;t be a begger and get your act together, for your own good."
xTra-yePY_A,@NietzscheanMan  ooooooo... Intimidated 😂😂😂😂😂
xTra-yePY_A,"@NietzscheanMan OMG, been waiting for your approval."
xTra-yePY_A,"@fiona fiona Oh, yeah I see what you sayin&#39;  Yes that makes sense, for overall cognitive average can be higher. I am not against to that. Actually I agree that yes, because there are brilliant people in poor conditions,yes; but they are minority and others are quite dumb. So, that makes sense then."
xTra-yePY_A,"... and still expected outcomes profit of higher financial means and invested time (including any word directed at a child), not because geniuses don&#39;t occur otherwise but because that will show more of the potential in most children."
xTra-yePY_A,"@fiona fiona Well I can&#39;t say anything about Britain or US actually. But I can talk about middle east, since it&#39;s where I grown up. There are very poor families as you might expect, although their children became more successful and much smarter then rich ones. &#39;cuz of they wanna get out from their dumpster. I even had an example about a scientist named Aziz Sancar, which earned a Chemistry Nobel prize about &quot;DNA repair&quot; couple of years ago. He was born, raised and studied under these poverty conditions. Yet he ended up with doing a fascinating research in US, when he immigrated after college. Also there are lots of examples like so as well. May be, this stimulation can be relevant with certain places in world. It might vary depending on location. Symptoms could be opposite. Because as I mentioned, it is quite the opposite here, in Turkey I mean.(No not ham, ba dum tss)"
xTra-yePY_A,"It&#39;s a cause, children who grow up in poverty are stimulated less and the British NHS has tested intervention that raised school scores even 10 years later!"
xTra-yePY_A,"@André Blackaller Yes, you&#39;re right. It goes either way."
xTra-yePY_A,MBA 4 LIFE but if you where actually very intelligent you would choose to raise a child in poverty so that’s debatable
xTra-yePY_A,Stupid people tend to be poor and have stupid kids. What a revelation.
xTra-yePY_A,"​@HitmannDDD Choice is not a factor when you can choose between watching your family starve and going to class for high school, where you will fail to graduate anyway because you are nearly starving and are suffering the effects of poverty talked about in this video.<br><br><br>Poverty is the result of uneven, and some would say unfair or irresponsibly chosen, distribution of resources. It is not a character flaw in those that are poor. Why don&#39;t they save their money? Because they don&#39;t have any. What you list as unneeded expenses, typically vice items like alcohol or just basic entertainment, are actually either needed for maintaining some semblance of sanity while living under constant stress and despair cause by poverty.<br><br><br>The ones that distribute the resources have chosen to have poverty remain. There is more than enough food, shelter, and opportunities for every human on the planet. Inefficiencies aside, people that make arguments against this would rather see dead babies, dead children, and horrible suffering than everyone living stable lives and everyone benefiting from society having more active members."
xTra-yePY_A,"Poverty in the US is the result of personal choices.  Studies from the Brookings Institute show that If you graduate high school, wait until you&#39;re 21 to get married and have children and hold a full time job, your chance of being below the poverty line drops to 2%.   <br><br>To &quot;fix the problem&quot; outside of individual responsibility is to institute totalitarian policies that infringe upon individual choice."
xTra-yePY_A,you need to notice how Poverty also affects the ability of Parents to raise their children properly.
xTra-yePY_A,@NietzscheanMan <br>why you keep describing your life. 😁
xTra-yePY_A,"Stupid people tend to be poor and tend to get stupid kids, imagine that."
xTra-yePY_A,"Anecdotal evidence from your own experiences does not invalidate any of the points that Dr. Noble made. People that grew up more privileged than you or I are gifted the things that you said you had to fight for. I believe that we should all have the same chance and we shouldn&#39;t have to go through hardship if we don&#39;t have to. Growing up poor, but with assistance and investment into the community you live in, as well as the people raising you can produce so much more than simple hardship and the need to survive."
xTra-yePY_A,@austin schuchmann LOL the Netherlands has more then 300 different nationalities. America was partly created by Dutch!  Size does not matter despite what Americans think. Just your motivation. If you want the American dream you need to work for it..
xTra-yePY_A,"@Virtual IT Boy The Netherlands is not as culturally diverse as America, nor does it have 300,000,000+/-  people across nearly an entire continent. Look at the big picture next time"
xTra-yePY_A,"+Your Favorite Lifecoach I think you missed the whole point of the presentation. The study is focused on whether providing financial aid from childbirth to first 40 months of the child&#39;s life affect child&#39;s brain development/structures.<br><br>So literally for 2.5 Years. These kids will still grow up in poverty don&#39;t worry. <br><br>The experiment is to study whether this extra sum will affect the child&#39;s brain development. The Hypothesis is/was that child&#39;s brain structures was already taking shape with less surface area in the poorer infants BEFORE kindergarden.<br><br>If the study is conclusive, they we can potentially give children is poverty a much better shot at a brighter future. <br><br>(This was all in the presentation, listen and process before responding)"
xTra-yePY_A,"@Virtual IT Boy <br>because in Murikkka. we are taught the false notions of Egoism, Self Centeredness...  and everything is 100% our fault and external Systemic factors hardly matter as witnessed by some of the responses here."
xTra-yePY_A,She does mention interventions in speech and language acquiring have reliable favourable effects.
xTra-yePY_A,Considering who we have as a president I say it doesnt
xTra-yePY_A,@Ozymandias<br>do we even know if he&#39;s a Billionaire?  he seems scared to show his Tax returns... .  🤔
xTra-yePY_A,"NATURAL LAW yeah he was millionaire, but then he became billionaire. He is dumb in the rest imo, but he’s very good at businesses."
xTra-yePY_A,@Ozymandias <br>hardly... he&#39;s just taken advantage of all the Financial help/support he has received throughout his life beginning at Birth. i&#39;ts basically just Wealth Protecting Wealth. happens all the time in these Wealthy/Elitist Families.
xTra-yePY_A,"NATURAL LAW in business yes, totally."
xTra-yePY_A,You are using the word <i>causation</i> incorrectly. I think you mean <i>effects.</i>
xTra-yePY_A,Epigenetics you can have the genetic components for intelligence but they never get turned on.
xTra-yePY_A,"Telling the neuroscientist experts about genetics, lol. Moreover, did you got the point that the brain is manipulable to experiences apart from their backgrounds (aka the genetics)?"
xTra-yePY_A,"@Hirmuinen Trolli IQ is okay, but what to do with the brain size  buddy..?"
xTra-yePY_A,What matters is brain size and IQ.
xTra-yePY_A,nice Ideological Rant bro&#39;.  🙄
xTra-yePY_A,"Maybe. But then the data will show that. In the end, all we — or she — can do is wait and see."
xTra-yePY_A,Well spoken and on point👆👌
xTra-yePY_A,😥
xTra-yePY_A,@NATURAL LAW Why you so POOR?
xTra-yePY_A,"I see you need brain development urgently as the speaker suggested, but you are not gonna get my money to do it. Letting stupid people run out of smart people&#39;s money will lead to extinction!!"
xTra-yePY_A,@Hirmuinen Trolli <br>before you can have any of those things at Healthy levels you Need effective Social factors at play to help grow them.
xTra-yePY_A,and what do you think is hurting that family structure? it rhymes with honey.. 🤨
xTra-yePY_A,Brain size and IQ is the most important factor.
xTra-yePY_A,@mhtinla <br>dude why you keep bringing up IQ and making Asinine comments at the same time. 😄
xTra-yePY_A,Einstein had a different pursuit that&#39;s beyond your IQ.
xTra-yePY_A,Why wasn&#39;t Einstein a billionaire then? Aducation is important give a child the tolls to learn and it will grow up to be a smart adult. Success doesn&#39;t eqaul IQ and IQ doesn&#39;t equal Money.
xTra-yePY_A,"Stupid people can&#39;t produce smart genes, no matter how much money you give them."
xTra-yePY_A,Глупость
xTra-yePY_A,olli tuovinen yes. Mostly inherited from the well nourished parents
xTra-yePY_A,Bigger brain is mostly inherited.
xTra-yePY_A,"J Briggs true. But health awareness comes from a wealthy population. You think the people of Venezuela or Syria are choosing to eat healthy, or just eat in general?"
xTra-yePY_A,"@John Dough23 I love brocolli.  Damn where do you live.  I buy it both frozen for cheap and fresh.  Either way there&#39;s lots of healthy food that isn&#39;t expensive at all.  example: fried rice.  a big bowl of fried rice costs like 25 cents.  All you need to do is fry an egg, some rice and some frozen mixxed veggies.  I know countless cheap recipes like that."
xTra-yePY_A,@J Briggs Clearly you are not eating Broccoli. I spent almost $8 yesterday for like 3 stalks of the crap. Imagine how many ramens I could have bought.
xTra-yePY_A,@SH which country is greater?  I&#39;m curious your opinion
xTra-yePY_A,@Nick Chambernator that would be income affecting brain development. Yes
xTra-yePY_A,Oh are you comparing 200 year old living standards to todays world? @Rich
xTra-yePY_A,@Nick Chambernator  non of that was a thing during the industrial revolution and the rise of the greatest god damn country on the face of the planet..... take a lap.
xTra-yePY_A,"Americans have access to all of that no matter what, even if they are homeless. Street lights are always on, they can drink cold water from water fountains and get hot water from public restrooms  and use the restroom with indoor plumbing. Also free access to a microwave at any 711.<br>@Rich"
xTra-yePY_A,@Kurt E. Clothier all probability indeed
xTra-yePY_A,"@Liberalism is cancer i dont think money determines success either. Money just suppresses exposure to problems, stress or perspectives that have a 50/50 chance of having a positive impact or negative. I believe it is important to how you&#39;re raised  and be able to process problems but there are children in the world that aren&#39;t being raised. I am still growing up a low income home. Thank you for supporting your community.👍"
xTra-yePY_A,Did you miss the analogy on the height of kids? &quot;Most boys are taller girls....etc&quot;
xTra-yePY_A,@pimp I don&#39;t think money determines success. It&#39;s about skills education and luck too. I run a charity for talented poor kids and they make it big in life.
xTra-yePY_A,I think what she&#39;s trying to figure out is why low income familes are more susceptible to failing ect overall.
xTra-yePY_A,"@BKF But it can&#39;t be quickly and easily put in place.  There is a difference between your own earned money, and a welfare handout.  It affects your self esteem.  We&#39;ve tried handing people money for decades now.  It&#39;s called welfare.  Since LBJ&#39;s Great Society we have been doing that, and it does not work.  The experiment has been done, and it failed."
xTra-yePY_A,@Jeremiah Bayles You&#39;re not hearing the  whole message. She simply says that money is a piece of the puzzle that can quickly and easily be put in place.  The rest will follow as our understanding and support interventions mature.
xTra-yePY_A,@Osiran rebel What is the effect of alcohol on politics?
xTra-yePY_A,"It also sounds like you know of the effects alcohol has on your politics.<br>This is too obvious , yet a CONservative doesn&#39;t seem to comprehend something so obvious."
xTra-yePY_A,"@Laurel I have no problem with aiding low income families, as I do so yearly through charitable donations and volunteerism, what I have a problem with is government mandated &quot;charity&quot; which I may be wrong but I assume Kimberly was implying in her little talk."
xTra-yePY_A,@Juliana Silva Edit: feel free to test your hypothesis with your and the other&quot;Democratic socialist&quot; money<br><br>Better?
xTra-yePY_A,@Juliana Silva agreed!!
xTra-yePY_A,Some low income familes can pull it off and provide the basics of it all. Even single parents. Maybe she was raised like that and never noticed? Don&#39;t know just trying to understand
xTra-yePY_A,lol  yes good point
xTra-yePY_A,@NietzscheanMan iq and genetics are malleable at a young age
xTra-yePY_A,Let&#39;s just ignore genetics and iq.
xTra-yePY_A,LOL... triggered by imaginary right wing Jesus.
xTra-yePY_A,The..&quot;your poor? Pull your self up by your bootstraps&quot; are the same people 😑 and they are already commenting...
xTra-yePY_A,"@Brenda Rua No breeder makes a decision, kinda the point. The system does not allow for such things to crossover. Hormones run the show."
xTra-yePY_A,I think you assume they make an actual decision.
xTra-yePY_A,@D Moreno-Guzman Sure bro go listen to your 26 &quot;twerk songs&quot; playlist lmfao anyone with those kind of songs needs to go back to sleep. 🙊👎
xTra-yePY_A,@DømiNğø🛻 Anyone who thinks being woke is an end result needs to keep waking up. 🙈✌
xTra-yePY_A,"@D Moreno-Guzman Apparently I know more than one language fluently, can speak read and write without a problem thanks lol. Runs just fine thanks for asking. What does it matter unless you are native american don&#39;t matter what your opinion is. I don&#39;t depend on you do I? Your another straw man my birth certificate isn&#39;t in all caps. Im woke and know what your trying to say chill out."
xTra-yePY_A,@DømiNğø🛻 Apparently you cant read..lol. 👌 how does your business run? Who owns the land your house is on? You depend on somone...get over yourself.
xTra-yePY_A,"@D Moreno-Guzman It does for me, im not indoctrinated with this false schooling system self-employed since I was a teen work for myself. Speak for yourself buddy."
xTra-yePY_A,@Amanda Anderson I agree with you too  😂
xTra-yePY_A,I agree. Especially those who are hardwired to stay in the same place with their primitive methods of living life in general. Those type of people can&#39;t lead their kids properly. Their kids are prone to develop insecurities. Eventually those kids are vulnerable to emotional problems and even depression. Some of those kids spend most of their time thinking about their insecurities &amp; feeling pity of their and their parents lifestyle instead of focusing properly on their future. I know a family who are facing the same problem and has a terrible head of the family. They don&#39;t live together now.
xTra-yePY_A,Yeah you should have 1 kid atleast not multiple.
xTra-yePY_A,"You may have a great understanding of climbing trees to chop firewood, but your market value will depend on language skills."
xTra-yePY_A,@Virtual IT Boy ohh
xTra-yePY_A,@Dhiraj in the Netherlands all schools are of the same quality and all of them are government owned. The government also provides loans with very low interest rates so you can go there no matter your income.
xTra-yePY_A,"@Virtual IT Boy ohh, congrats for your new job. But i hate that in capitalist countries rich people can send their kids to best schools providing very high and good quality of education while the poor people get bad quality of education and lesser opportunities. I am from a middle class family and i would have been so intelligent today if i was studying in a better school till 10 th std. In india, poor people send their kids to government school (very very bad quality of education), lower middle class can afford to send their kids to state board, middle class to state board and cbse schools, higher middle class can go to ICSE schools and rich people can go to the best schools in the world."
xTra-yePY_A,@Hirmuinen Trolli that’s a lie Lolol I dropped out of school at 16 never got my GED and I make 1500$ a week. So that statement is bs
xTra-yePY_A,Stephen Brown who hurt you?
xTra-yePY_A,Sumdee Rumlee no one said that lol
xTra-yePY_A,"Life Progress - Health, Wealth, &amp; Happiness Channel I disagree ,poverty is a start of revolution and change!not every child of poverty is a criminal."
xTra-yePY_A,Stephen Brown crime as a mass statistic genius. Not gangs of organized crime. Those are much rarer than huge populations of street criminals. Who do you think populates most of our prisons?
xTra-yePY_A,@Unknown Error So in the USA if the Left got into &quot;guns&quot; we would have a Revolution? But the Right is perfectly satisfied (other than Rush and Hannity) with the way things are? but were a little put-off with 8 yrs of Obama? but not that put-off? &quot;hey it ain&#39;t my kid ending up in the trash can&quot;.
xTra-yePY_A,It&#39;s the iq. Stupid people tend to be poor and have stupid kids. How unexpected.
xTra-yePY_A,@Paul Googol k
xTra-yePY_A,@J Briggs That&#39;s fine. It pretty much falls in line with what she is sayi.  You just needed to  make the connection.  But you know when I see a statement such as &quot;more likely&quot; I want to know the details lol
xTra-yePY_A,"@John Dough23 that&#39;s what i mean. You sort of proved my point. Im not saying children are brain dead. Im saying the are extremely maluable at a young age. Some perspectives are more powerful than others. In your case you followed your grandparents footsteps and not your parents for whatever reason that is your own. As you get older your sense of judgment heights and you pick and choose what matters most. I&#39;m not saying you&#39;re wrong there&#39;s plenty of theories in child development. For example, that if your grandfather was actually not your grandfather and you not find out till you are a fully developed adult. He would have had the same impact without being aware."
xTra-yePY_A,@Brenda Rua lol.  the biological children of the parents.   If a parent is intelligent with a high income obviously their children are more likely to be intelligent.  Same goes for the children of low income parents with lower intelligence.
xTra-yePY_A,"@pimp No in fact there is mounting evidence most of us are continuing the work of grandparents. Their traits are manifest as our own. I can absolutely attest to this in my case. Most of my core values, mannerism etc are almost exact copies of my Grandfather. None of this says you cannot have massive empty memory at birth, but you are no more able to change your skin color than you are deep seated personality traits. I have even seen pictures of the most famous Malthusian of all-time , ideas I hold to the extreme I am told, I look almost exactly like him...Thomas Robert Malthus. I seriously do not see this as some bizarre coincidence. I don&#39;t believe in such things."

o0TGczdbiV4,@For Games how is that relevant?
o0TGczdbiV4,Wow 👏
o0TGczdbiV4,What are they addicted to?
o0TGczdbiV4,Hope this is not too personal. Your child sounds very smart along with the other kids in his class based on your comment. Has he been vaccinated? I&#39;m sorry if the question is too personal. I appreciate any replies.
o0TGczdbiV4,Oh nice my child hit all these when they were 18 months.
o0TGczdbiV4,Same here. Well done!!!!
o0TGczdbiV4,🎯💯🆗🗣

o0TGczdbiV4,Right here🙋‍♀️😂
o0TGczdbiV4,Don&#39;t take too much notice if 3 years later you&#39;re still writing 😆 my 3 Yr old is a lot more advanced than is depicted here
o0TGczdbiV4,@Caitlyn Rice Same.
o0TGczdbiV4,"no, i commend you for throughout research!"
o0TGczdbiV4,"No, but it&#39;s weird that you would tell us about it."
o0TGczdbiV4,"you should, and you&#39;re doing absolutely the right thing! the reason I&#39;m watching this video is to point out a poorly written character who&#39;s impossible to be aged 4."
o0TGczdbiV4,"Stop taking life so seriously. Kids see the world as a silly place of nonsense. Keep that in your mind at all times and they will love it. Be as ridiculous as possible, they hold no judgement."
o0TGczdbiV4,Brittany Powers lol I have the same problem it’s like they know when you leave the bed. Mine can be snoring and all of sudden I leave and go in the kitchen and I turn around she’s staring at me lol
o0TGczdbiV4,"Yessss if I move he moves, if I try sneaking out of bed when I&#39;m putting him into his he will wake up and follow, I can&#39;t get him off my hip unless he&#39;s playing toys and even then most of the time he wants me to play with him 😂"
o0TGczdbiV4,Melissa Sherriff omg so is mine she won’t sleep alone she wants me to hug her lol
o0TGczdbiV4,@Michael Macillicutti My kid is older now.. I&#39;m over that pride. lol
o0TGczdbiV4,This video makes me feel even better than you cause my child is much more advanced than even yours is.  😜
o0TGczdbiV4,Was looking for this comment. This seems very modest as my 3 Yr old is more advanced lol
o0TGczdbiV4,"Exactly. My son was at this point at 2, early 3. He&#39;s already writing letters, coloring within lines, does 20-30 piece puzzles right away, is highly imaginative, and very intuitive about things like space and electricity. It&#39;s pretty wild. He will be 4 in 3 months."
o0TGczdbiV4,I&#39;m 21 now but honestly 8 year olds are often going to go on youtube. Been here since I was a second grader going on og youtube looking for high school musical videos in 2007😂
o0TGczdbiV4,Артем Алексинцев yes
o0TGczdbiV4,@Lucy The Horse Girl I&#39;m 11 and I can&#39;t use yt now??
o0TGczdbiV4,@Lucy The Horse Girl why can&#39;t 8 year olds be on YouTube?
o0TGczdbiV4,East coast Thrilla then why are you on youtube

bQpaMoq-x88,"I&#39;m in the same boat, and with COVID happening she hasn&#39;t been around other kids, so was thinking we just think she&#39;s ahead because we are her parents, but then talking with other parents they are surprised at what she does. <br>And you can&#39;t outright talk about it online as parents don&#39;t seem to likenit, it&#39;s fine for parents to celebrate kids doing things when it&#39;s around normal time, but if you have a kid that&#39;s ahead all of a sudden you are showing off. My daughter will be 2 at the end of the month, she speaks quite clearly, in sentences, can count to 10 organize things by colour, shape or size, she knows abc and the phonics sounds that corresponds with each one, even able to name some words starting with letters, my partner sits her at his PC he tells her what letters to press, space bar and enter and she does it without needing help now.<br>She does stuff that shocks me and my partner all the time, yesterday she read the word dad with zero help, 2 days ago she had 3 toys 2 next to each other 1 apart with a gap, she pointed and said 2 and 1 that&#39;s 3, our jaws are still on the floor lol. The throwing a ball always makes me laugh, she could throw a ball and hit me with it before she was even walking 🤣"
bQpaMoq-x88,Thank you so very much! 🙏🏾🤍🤍🤍
bQpaMoq-x88,You&#39;re welcome!
bQpaMoq-x88,Thank you!! 🤍
bQpaMoq-x88,Yes!! Does anyone in the family that has kids already say she is smart? My son is almost two and these skills all seem old to me. My dad says he’s really smart but I just thought it was normal. The talking skills only get better and it’s crazy how much they learn in a day! My son says things that I didn’t even know he knew. 3-4 word sentences and many of them lol
bQpaMoq-x88,Glad to hear it!
bQpaMoq-x88,Hi there! Yes!  I have an playlist dedicated to the sensory system / sensory processing. Hit the playlist tab on my channel and you will see it pop up. 💗
bQpaMoq-x88,This video was made in 2018.
bQpaMoq-x88,Update?
bQpaMoq-x88,Update?
bQpaMoq-x88,"I\&#39;m not sure but ,if anyone else trying to find out toddlers and tantrums  try Loctavan Teaching Toddler  Strategy (do a search on google ) ? Ive heard some unbelievable things about it and my partner got amazing results with it."
bQpaMoq-x88,"@Cici Thank you for the reassuring message. It was something that scared me a lot and I didn&#39;t know how to respond to it initially. I almost went into a depression, but after spending some time alone writing down my thoughts and feelings, I was able to respond to her anxiety in more selfless, caring way. You are absolutely right that all children need love and affection, that is how you nurture a well adapted , self aware and prosperous child. You son is lucky to have such a caring mother."
bQpaMoq-x88,My son is also 22mos and he has had a few anxious moments resulting in shaking.  (I am not an expert just a mom who has raised 4 kids). I have noticed that the second I pick him up and kiss him he calms down. I Think he is looking for reassurance that he is ok and that mommy is always going to be there. He is going through separation anxiety again with me only (not his dad). I have been told by outsiders that I am making a “mamas boy”. I hate that term!!! All babies need a bond with someone and usually that<br>Someone is mom.   <br>I think your child is normal and just is looking for reassurance. Likely she will outgrow this. It may be an early sign of an anxious personality which isn’t so bad just keep in communication with the pediatrician.
bQpaMoq-x88,Harvinder Parhar   Don’t worry. Your child is a wonderful person anyway. Here is a book to help you understand him or her: Uniquely Human by Dr. Barry Prizant. It gives so many examples of things that can baffle parents and others who know a child with autism. It stresses trying to determine WHY a child does certain things. It’s like being a behavior detective. This book has helped me as a Special Ed aide.  Your child is an important being who wants to communicate.
bQpaMoq-x88,"Mine as well, hard work aren&#39;t they!"
bQpaMoq-x88,Don&#39;t worry if your boy follow your instructions . N you must keep talking to your baby repeat same words again n again cause babies learn with repetation . Do watch videos on my channel playlist there are videos where m showing how to teach baby talk
bQpaMoq-x88,"Nothing tonworry dear if your baby following your instructions , some kind de do some availability bit late"
bQpaMoq-x88,"Hahah mine too, everytime i lay down, he either stand on my chest or on my head... I don’t know why they loving doing it but its not cute"
bQpaMoq-x88,things changed quickly after this lol
bQpaMoq-x88,"Hahaha! Yes, it sure is! Love it - especially living in CA with the fires and dry weather!"
bQpaMoq-x88,Same 😂😂
bQpaMoq-x88,Talk talk talk to him.  Put down the phone and talk to him.
bQpaMoq-x88,"Kate C. My son too he says a few words but not sentences, he just turn 3 🤦🏻‍♀️"
bQpaMoq-x88,I hope your daughter is doing well 👍🐎
bQpaMoq-x88,"Maybe it&#39;s nothing but to be shure check this boxes: Does he point with finger? Does he respond to his name? Does he look you in the eyes? Does he folow simple commands like sit down, give me that, come here? Does he play with toys? Is he playing with others? Does he ignore people? If you point with your finger in a direction of a thing you want him to see, does he look where you are pointing? Also have you noticed repetetive behaviour or strange body  movements, hyperactivity and <br>attantion deficit? If your child doesn&#39;t  do most of the first 5 things and has short attantion spann and repetitive things going on, get him evaluated so you can get him help. Early intervantion is the key!"
bQpaMoq-x88,Strength to you and your baby boy o/
bQpaMoq-x88,Good for you.
bQpaMoq-x88,Is he vegan ?
bQpaMoq-x88,"Go mama, go! 💜"
bQpaMoq-x88,Ryu Oreo hes 2 years and 8 months to be exact
bQpaMoq-x88,Kids OT Help of course!
bQpaMoq-x88,Lol!! Maybe Kai and her can be friends? He looovvveess that song too! 🤣🤣🤣
bQpaMoq-x88,Me too
bQpaMoq-x88,Ditto. I&#39;m in exactly the same position.
bQpaMoq-x88,That’s so interesting....
bQpaMoq-x88,Thank you!! Xx
bQpaMoq-x88,Talk to your doc about it. My little guy wasn&#39;t talking either and now he&#39;s doing AWESOME in speech therapy :) Your child sounds like a bright kid and working on the speech while he&#39;s still young will help him a lot. Having lots of things to say and no way to say it can get very frustrating for kids as they get older and they often act out as a result.
bQpaMoq-x88,I think some kids develop on their own time. My husband was valedictorian of his high school class and his speech was delayed.   I hope he or she catches up soon 👍
bQpaMoq-x88,LivingDead Demon Are they special needs?
bQpaMoq-x88,@JACOB BAKER she isn&#39;t talking about a specific age. She&#39;s giving us a guideline on what to expect between ages 2-3. Also a lot of toddlers develop at a different pace so if she did say months it wouldn&#39;t really matter unless you are teaching them these things in a specific order vs at their own pace.
bQpaMoq-x88,yea...that ruins the entire video. always say months
bQpaMoq-x88,Yasssssss
bQpaMoq-x88,This is a generalization of what a two year old on average should be doing
bQpaMoq-x88,Same question
bQpaMoq-x88,"Mine too, washing hands for 20 seconds that&#39;s how she leaned 😁"
bQpaMoq-x88,Yes! It’s exciting 🥰
bQpaMoq-x88,Mine is too
bQpaMoq-x88,"@Marina Julien  also, im unsure how YouTube works I&#39;ll message you my private information. Im an older mom who friends kiddos are all teens or late elementary. I sure could use the mom toddler talk as well!!"
bQpaMoq-x88,@Marina Julien  it&#39;s okay momma. You&#39;re doing what moms do- worry.  But all 4 of my kids different things at different ages. It&#39;s impossible to say a kid must do this or that at this age on the nose. Trust me just when you get discourage she will do what u are concerned she isn&#39;t doing. And you&#39;ll feel silly 😂. Good luck momma!   Enjoy this age it&#39;s so cute and fun! Trust me a 14 year old girl is the opposite of both those things 😅😅😅
bQpaMoq-x88,Thank you so much! That just made my night. I honestly do worry because I see the kids at church or the park...I wonder why she isn’t doing what their doing. I’m a first time mom. Short story I’m adopted and have very little family. So I’m not fortunate to have seen other kids grow up in the family. I have no reference but learning with her but thank you for your kind words. I really appreciate it 😊.
bQpaMoq-x88,"Hello! I&#39;m not the person you are asking questions to but I&#39;m a mom of 4 with a lil guy who just turned 2 two days ago.  Unlike my other kids my 2 year has very little contact with kids his own age. His siblings are significantly older. And I will say not being around kids his age significantly shows. So I wouldn&#39;t be to stressed about it:)  My son says words, knows his colors, and numbers. Yet he cannot speak simple sentences.  For example he cannot communicate phrases such as &quot; go fast.&quot;   Every child has their strength and weaknesses.  Albeit screen time should be limited nursery ryhmes and educational videos youtube has helped my son learn colors, numbers, the alphabet as well at learn the sounds of the alphabet.  Flash cards are great! I made some with index card tailored to fit his learning style.  I always say what I&#39;m doing or what I&#39;m handing him. I try to get him to say it as well. &quot; Thank You&quot; and &quot;please&quot; ...so forth.    Unless your child seems absolutely confused as to what you are saying don&#39;t lose sleep...stop watching videos and DON&#39;T compare your child. I have fallen down that rabbit hole one to many times.  I promise one day it clicks for them. We just have to let them do it on their own terms."
bQpaMoq-x88,"I&#39;m a music therapy student and I agree! Preparing a session right now and this is SO helpful, thanks!"

bQpaMoq-x88,"Mrs. Kingpin it’s hard to tell and kids develop so differently. Kids who may seem advanced as toddlers can be struggling later on or be at an average level by the time they’re in middle school. Or they may continue to be advanced from the toddler stage to adulthood or up to some lower age. <br>If a child struggle to do these standard things that’s something to pay attention to but the idea that a child has to be able to do the same things as the kids around them is unfair to do to a child because kids are individuals just like us adults and they are better at some things and need to practice at some or have reached their potential in some areas for that level of their age. So much comes in to play because one kid may be born early in a year and another late in the year (and we all know so much happens even in just one or two months for a child), so that’s another aspect why it’s important to not compare kids (even if they are born in the same month). <br>If one looks at children growing up in abusive homes they can physically be ok but psychologically seem to struggle with basic things because they didn’t have adults to invest time with them so they didn’t develop different skills and their language level will often be at a lower level. Often these kids from abusive homes will be very timid or very ”energetic” (due to low self-esteem or trying to cope with big emotions no one taught them how to handle etc).<br><br>It’s lovely to see videos such as this with a toddler who is happy and engaging and whose boundaries is respected (asking if they want to do different things and not having the child be met with disappointment if they say ”no”. <br><br>Please don’t compare your child with other kids, but if you, like other parents may notice things meet them there so they can excel to the best of their ability. <br>As a kid, adults considered me advanced and I started school one year early and skipped one grade, but around high school (even if I was he higher end at my class) I had reached a point where I had to work hard for my grades like all the other students at the higher end. The whole advanced is putting too much stress on parents and kids. <br>💛<br><br>Ps. I apologize in advance for any potential grammar/spelling errors, but English is my 3rd language."
bQpaMoq-x88,Hahaha! I did make a video on potty training (you can search “potty training”  on my channel). I had a long a road with it and we are just crossing over to completion 😂 I will have to make an updated video to share the entire journey.
bQpaMoq-x88,Thank you!! 💜💜
bQpaMoq-x88,"+Andres Brambila good point! This would be for 24 months. However, development happens at different rates! So while these are skills that a lot of 24 month olds will demonstrate. Some will take longer to meet these milestones while others may have already met them before 24 months."
bQpaMoq-x88,Yes I was thinking that too. Is this like 24 month old expectations.. I think so maybe?
bQpaMoq-x88,"Thanks, Ebony! Xx"
bQpaMoq-x88,"I disagree because this is the bare minimum. Either there is an issue or maybe there has been no active development of those skills. GRANTED, I have only a meagee 2yrs 1 Month of experience lol!"
bQpaMoq-x88,Exactly!
bQpaMoq-x88,Well said. Thank you
bQpaMoq-x88,"True my baby sister steals my trumpet and plays it some times  and  can say what Color  and objects is, and If she sees,you sweeping she will try to help If you let her and she can organise tiny castles yellow, blue, and pink in color order<br><br>Edit she is 2 and a half"
bQpaMoq-x88,I have noticed this some milestones are met and exceeded while others take longer to happen. For instance our son was born with club feet and he was delayed when it came to walking and did not start until 16 months then just absolutely exploded in progression. Then it seemed like he was having difficulty learning names of different objects but again all of sudden whatever had to click clicked and I can teach him any new object and he will learn the name of it within 10 seconds and remember it. Speech is the one right now that is taking him longer than anything else he does say quite a few words but for whatever reason it always seems to be when he feels like it I am sure this is normal so I just encourage him to speak. You can&#39;t force a child to speak if they don&#39;t want to in fact I don&#39;t believe in forcing a child to do anything my philosophy is if something isn&#39;t working do something else or do it another way that always seems to work.
bQpaMoq-x88,lovehope3753 so happy you found it helpful! Thank you for your feedback. 💜😊
bQpaMoq-x88,Thank you!!
bQpaMoq-x88,"@Nekole Amber it was a quite useful and amazing video, thank you ❤️"
bQpaMoq-x88,+thesefourguyz hahaha! That’s awesome!! 👏🏾
bQpaMoq-x88,Its normal I learned to talk really early by age 3 I was talking fluently   .
bQpaMoq-x88,Mine too! He&#39;s 26 months old and he&#39;ll stay stuff like &quot;I just want some broccoli but Daddy shut the door and said no&quot;
bQpaMoq-x88,I&#39;m sorry to hear this. I&#39;d imagine it is very tough to be in that position. They are lucky to have an aunt who is so aware of their needs!
bQpaMoq-x88,Pick one language. He&#39;s confused he may understand but he needs a MAIN language and stay in that lane with him...once he starts speaking the MAIN then go back to teaching whatever other language you want him to speak...
bQpaMoq-x88,@Yulia Shapira  ASD is a cluster of symptoms in different avenues that one shows. The main thing is &quot;regression&quot; where your DD losses the skill they once mastered. If you keep looking up ASD and its symptoms youll start focusing on the negative signs and start ticking boxes in your head(it drove me nuts for weeks)...try to see what your DD actually does good and if theyre progressing at all it can be slow but thats ok. Not all kids reach milestones on the dot. If you still have uneasy feeling. Get the hearing tested and definitely see a paediatrician.last thing you want is a false diagnosis and a stigma towards your little one. 🧡
bQpaMoq-x88,"@Maria Galicia Same with my DD. We are billingual, she is 19 months and I had concerns for ASD."
bQpaMoq-x88,My son is bilingual too filipino/ english he is 18 months old he communicates with shaking his head and nodding and a lot of babbling. I even looked up ASD and it just got me scared. In saying that i went to a paediatrician and he said my son doesnt have it. Its good to be concern by that age but i wouldnt stress out too much.
bQpaMoq-x88,Fay L very advanced you are beyond lucky
bQpaMoq-x88,my 2y/o can write his name at 2 .. is that normal 🤔
bQpaMoq-x88,It’s impressive I was not this smart but my mother was not this engaged
bQpaMoq-x88,Amber C Mine too she can also read some sight words
bQpaMoq-x88,​@Nekole Amber  Oh Oky Thank YOu
bQpaMoq-x88,"Hi there! That sounds pretty typical. They will likely still fall or lose their balance from time to time; sometimes until closer to the age of 3. You can always double check with your pediatrician if you are really concerned, but that sounds typical of a 2 year old&#39;s gross motor development. :)"
bQpaMoq-x88,Leave it for the parent to worry about
bQpaMoq-x88,Hey Ryan! Keep in mind that there is a range of &quot;typical&quot; development. Some kiddos may lag a little to develop a skill but can still be considered typically developing. If you think the delay is significant you can always suggest he/she check with their pediatrician.
bQpaMoq-x88,Nusrat Zaman same my baby will be 2 next month 🥴
bQpaMoq-x88,"kevin kevin same <a href=""http://here.my/"">here.my</a> baby just turns 24 months this February and he only say “dada”..Some of my relative said it’s not good sign that my baby can’t talk yet..I told to my family physician 2months ago that he can’t say more words..Doctor told me not to show tv and talk with him all time..But he is very active he don’t want to sit a place he just want to see tv and keep running and playing all time..I don’t feel any problem accepting speech delay..He is very healthy and active baby..what I can do ??"
bQpaMoq-x88,"Adam Khan theres a speech delay class its free paid by ur insurance if not the state pay for it if u dont have insurance. But let me assure u my child is 25th months now and he only say 1 word. That 1 word is daddy :). Anyway I struggle to teach him to say more because hes very moving, he won’t sit still, so i just let him watch TV. Sometimes it takes time, im sure they will be really good at talking around 3 years of age. Just be patience."
bQpaMoq-x88,My baby too but he just started Speech Therapy..He comprehends commands and stuff . He not talking or saying as much. I think he will be a late talker! Just keep at it and take whatever steps needed to help your baby.
bQpaMoq-x88,My three years old is now hitting these 2 year old milestones
bQpaMoq-x88,"@Team Queen’ s Fearn Tucker and Bentley Forever Like I said keep your eyes on them, ALSO they have the trampolines you can purchase that include the safety net around them..."
bQpaMoq-x88,"@Team Queen’ s Fearn Tucker and Bentley Forever Well with that type of mentality no wonder she&#39;s not jumping lol. Trampolines are fine especially if your watching them! Like I said he was 8 months when I put him on there..just sitting down, lightly make him go up and down that&#39;s all...holds hands and jump with them, LIGHTLY....but okay. Just trying to help..."
bQpaMoq-x88,"Try a trampoline, trust me I was putting my son on there at 8 months and he loves jumping now at 2,  improved his balance etc..."
bQpaMoq-x88,@Team Queen’ s Fearn Tucker and Bentley Forever She walks and runs just fine.  Last time we saw her pediatrician she wasn&#39;t concerned but as we approach three I&#39;m a little worried. She does try to jump but she keeps one foot on the ground. I just keep crossing my fingers that she&#39;ll figure it out soon.
bQpaMoq-x88,eatnet <br>How is she now?? Please let me know
bQpaMoq-x88,"Also, I must say my girl knows at least 150 words if not more but never speaks! I mean never ever engage with us using words. Always take my or missus hand to what she wants. As I said she knows every animal on her books, almost all the cards - letters and number with examples (over 100)  and play with toys like NT no problem. Eye contacts and hearing, and motor skills are fine."
bQpaMoq-x88,Haha I think it is more impressive than anything else! Girls seem to pick up language quicker than boys in many cases. She is just a rockstar!
bQpaMoq-x88,"Thank you so much, Tash! Xx"
bQpaMoq-x88,"@Fearn and Tucker’s Angel Forever if you know so much and you&#39;re so smart, what are you even doing here? What is your problem? Coming here and hurting others saying their children are &quot;behind&quot; ? How dare you"
bQpaMoq-x88,"​@Team Queen’ s Fearn Tucker and Bentley Forever No, he&#39;s not. I&#39;ve seen 3 of your comments so far and I can&#39;t imagine what child care course would teach you that children should be speaking in full sentences by 14 months. That&#39;s so far from the AAP guidelines and contrary to the vast majority of experts in the field. If your 14 month old niece is having adult conversations at 14 months (which seems doubtful) then kudos to her, but that&#39;s not the norm. Not even close."
bQpaMoq-x88,That&#39;s amazing!! So fun to watch them grow. :)
bQpaMoq-x88,Point and Perspective <br>How is he doing now?
bQpaMoq-x88,Point and Perspective how is your son doing now
bQpaMoq-x88,"Same,my son just turned 3 and say mama dada,car,cheese,that&#39;s it,he understands everything etc but won&#39;t talk"
bQpaMoq-x88,"@Nekole Amber I have been referred to a speech therapist but the appointment is far off, next January."
bQpaMoq-x88,Thank you so much!! :) Is your son receiving any speech therapy to help progress speech?
bQpaMoq-x88,"Thank you, Natasha! :)"
bQpaMoq-x88,"Thank you, Jayda!! Haha I believe they are from target! The Cat &amp; Jack line has adorable clothes, so we have a lot of their clothes. :)"
bQpaMoq-x88,"my 16 months baby know head, shoulder, knees, toes, nose, mouth, teeth, hair, feet..she pointed all when i asked her..and she can say few words mama dada nana bird duck car ball flower , n can make couple of animal noise..looking forward to watch for more n more new skills every single day.."
bQpaMoq-x88,I know right? It blew my mind too
bQpaMoq-x88,@Andres Brambila I started teaching my child sign language at 6 months (once she held her bottle on her own) and by 7 months she was signing without me asking her to. By 2 years old she was counting to 10 because the daycare she attends would recite the ABCs with her and count 1-10 daily. All toddlers develop at a different pace. You just haven&#39;t been around many toddlers.
bQpaMoq-x88,My daughter is 2 yrs 4 months and can sing the entire alphabet song ! Even the ending lol I cried and was left speechless   she can also count to 10 . <br>I had the DVD &quot;your baby can read&quot; playing since she was 6 months old and before a year old could read some  sight words
bQpaMoq-x88,"Yeah my daughter just did it perfectly today as well, 2 years 2 months old"
bQpaMoq-x88,Thank you so much!! :)
bQpaMoq-x88,Thank you!! :)
bQpaMoq-x88,@Rachel Mabey my son got diagnosed with autism mild to moderate so I guess my worrying was justified
bQpaMoq-x88,@Jennifer cruz update?
bQpaMoq-x88,Omg my son too my son only says hi airplane and like 3 more words he does everything else...this is worrying me
bQpaMoq-x88,"Team Queen’ s Fearn Tucker and Bentley Forever actually you’re wrong. Every kid is different and develops at their own pace, saying that, it’s HIGHLY unlikely a 14 month old will be having “adult conversations”."
bQpaMoq-x88,Sounds pretty typical of kids to do things only when they are motivated to do it. ;)
bQpaMoq-x88,Salma K y
bQpaMoq-x88,Salma K my daughter did the same thing to my partner. I started to take my child to big new social settings.
bQpaMoq-x88,"Hi Salma! So there is a range of normal, of course. It is hard to say one way or another without having more information about your daughter. If you are concerned, and want an OTs perspective I am taking clients for OT consultation sessions. Or you can always mention it to your daughter&#39;s pediatrician. Usually, kids will grow out of that phase; but again, hard to assess without more information."
bQpaMoq-x88,"Awesome!! Keep up the good work, mama!"
bQpaMoq-x88,Thank you!!
bQpaMoq-x88,@Leena Goundar Kai is 26 months in this video 🤍
bQpaMoq-x88,@Nekole Amber pls specify how old is ur son in this video?u don&#39;t seem to answer this specific question everyone is asking.
bQpaMoq-x88,"Hi Brittani! These are the milestones that MOST toddlers are able to do by the age of two. There is a bell curve, so some kids will meet it before two years old and others will meet it after two years old. From my experience with this age, I&#39;ve seen around 3ish months on either side. Hope that helps!"
bQpaMoq-x88,Nathan Medina children in special education have the option to remain in school until 21.
bQpaMoq-x88,I don&#39;t want to sound like a troll but you said children 0-21 but never knew people around 21 were children.
bQpaMoq-x88,"Hi there! I am a pediatric occupational therapist. A large portion of the occupational therapy program is dedicated to child development. I have also been working with this population for about 5 years ranging from treating premature infants in the NICU to children 0-21 years old with typical and atypical development. And of course, I continue to keep up on the latest research and evidence based practices by constantly taking continuing education courses. :)"

kNRxxXA1jtc,Milan Micci 👏👏👏
kNRxxXA1jtc,What about if a toddler regressed in words little and not as responsive as they were Milan? Would you get a therapist or let them ride it out?
kNRxxXA1jtc,"Milan Micci  👏👏👏👏 well said. Let kids be kids, it&#39;ll happen when it happens"
kNRxxXA1jtc,"Milan Micci I understand that part. But the thing about Autism is real. The moderate to severe ones will highly impaired those children&#39;s lives. I think they meant well with early intervention. It gave good prognosis. But yeah, I understand. Sometimes half of them don&#39;t really need it. Mothers became paranoids, and push their children unnecessarily. They&#39;re just late bloomer, and will bloom at their own pace. But others don&#39;t. And when it&#39;s late, it&#39;ll certainly be too late. It&#39;ll forever be a difficult situation."
kNRxxXA1jtc,Thank you!
kNRxxXA1jtc,Jesus Christ I hope you&#39;re right Milan. I truly truly do.

0xS11aTULow,"@Mix Lee I learned and realized that changes in the brain during childhood enable not only the cognitive development but also in the physical &amp; emotional and contributes greater flexibility of thought. Factors including school, peers and family play a big role in their cognitive and socio-emotional development. There are also different rates of growth in different stages of learning. For me it shouldn&#39;t matter how slowly the child learns as long as we are encouraging them not to stop learning 😊"

ndOB-vXwXxM,"I used to spend a lot of time on YouTube as a child too. I was homeschooled and it felt like there wasn&#39;t much else to do, though now i realize that I was wrong about that. There were other things I could have done, I just didnt know about them at the time. I would wake up, get on the computer, and watch youtube until it was time for bed. I regret spending so much time on youtube. I think about all the memories I could have made, the places I could have gone, the things I could have done, the times when I could have connected with my siblings, but didnt. I wish my parents had done something about it because now I&#39;m having to deal with multiple mental health issues. It wasn&#39;t watching the videos themselves that caused these issues, but it was all the things that I <b>didnt</b> do that made me unhappy in the end."
ndOB-vXwXxM,"@Random Human Can you like, not reply? This comment is two months old. Plus you can still have social interaction even if you okay video games 8 hours a day. Also, these kinds of arguments are said for all kinds of things, but if it&#39;s so bad..Why isn&#39;t anyone doing anything about it?"
ndOB-vXwXxM,"@ColBob With the amount of screen time that little girl is getting, that can set back her development. It can stunt both her social development and language skills because she&#39;s so used to just being online and not having to talk to people or practice those skills.<br><br>It&#39;s not good for a very young child to have that much screen time because it can also lower her attention span GREATLY because of the instant gratification that technology gives us.<br><br>It doesn&#39;t matter how educational a game is, there has to be limits at some point because there&#39;s so much development that happens at that girl&#39;s age that she&#39;s not practicing."
ndOB-vXwXxM,@Random Human Wha- how does Minecraft Education edition and COOL MATH GAMES harms a child&#39;s brain...These are educational games. You&#39;re gonna have to try harder than that.
ndOB-vXwXxM,@ColBob Did you watch the video? The games you&#39;re talking about can harm the child&#39;s brain development at such a young age.
ndOB-vXwXxM,@Metal Rockstarizer Yeah the internet turned into a rabbit hole.
ndOB-vXwXxM,"@Metal Rockstarizer I definitely agree with you there, things are worse than ever before, but it&#39;s just that it&#39;s been heading that direction for generations now. We can&#39;t imagine how much of our social lives we lost when television became standard in every house, and I myself lived through the first generation that wanted to play videogames instead of playing outside. Now we have social media, which I agree is worse and more consuming, but I&#39;m alarmed that this has been the general direction for the last many generations. Imagine how much worse the future will be for our children."
ndOB-vXwXxM,"@Shiftless Lazycrat I don’t think you guys had it worse than we did. I’m pretty sure back in the 90s there wasn’t the fear of missing out, people acting fake on social media, influencer status, tik tok, fake people, fake friends etc. I don’t think  the video games and television back then are as toxic as the social media influencer age that we live in. I personally think social media is far worse than video games and television."
ndOB-vXwXxM,"@Metal Rockstarizer I&#39;m Gen Y, and this has been a problem since before I was born. I was born with a Nintendo controller in my hand and a television on in every room. Even the generation before me was born with constant television in their lives. Television was the coffin, and the internet was the nail in the coffin. We are becoming more and more enslaved to the corporate profit machine, there&#39;s no way to stop it. We&#39;re not just consumers, we&#39;re the product itself."

ndOB-vXwXxM,Star Butterfly I think it’s only harmful if you get a lot of screen time during the “critical period” of 0-3 years old
ndOB-vXwXxM,"@Shqipe tv tbh I&#39;m 14, most times I go for 6-8 hours straight. Right now, I&#39;ve been going for 8.5 hours and I&#39;m still going"
ndOB-vXwXxM,"@Metal Rockstarizer Look man, I&#39;m not gonna try and waste your time, all I&#39;m saying is everyone has a bias when it comes to something, but you should at least try and understand another&#39;s perspective. You might understand a little more and come up with a conclusion of your own."
ndOB-vXwXxM,@Metal Rockstarizer It&#39;s not the social media that&#39;s the problem. It&#39;s the people that use it. Does regulating screen time reduce the toxicity on social media? No. There are still people spouting toxic nonsense on the internet. That still exposes children to these toxic environments.
ndOB-vXwXxM,"@ColBob video games don’t judge you, video games don’t tell your missing out video games don’t tell you you gossip. Social media is bad period. It  needs regulation. Everyone knows social media is worse than video games correct? Because it is indeed."
ndOB-vXwXxM,"@Metal Rockstarizer You&#39;re like the internet incarnate. You&#39;re trying to judge people based on their hobbies, if they&#39;re mature, they can moderate their time themselves. Plus, why are you so dead-set that video games are bad for your health when you stated you grew up without technology? How would you know without trying it out yourself?"

ndOB-vXwXxM,"@Shiftless Lazycrat Due to online school, just to even talk to our friends sadly we have to use screens, and there’s no way to avoid it."
ndOB-vXwXxM,"@Shiftless Lazycrat thank you, and I just use screens more due to online school."
ndOB-vXwXxM,"@Chill pill 201 I totally agree with you, and you&#39;re definitely one of the smartest 10 year olds I&#39;ve ever spoken to. Most adults I&#39;ve met aren&#39;t as bright as you are, so keep up what you&#39;re doing. My only advice is to stay disciplined and don&#39;t use screens when you don&#39;t have to, excessive screen use is the most common habit these days and it&#39;s harmful to the brain and body."
ndOB-vXwXxM,"@Shiftless Lazycrat Well I agree, but in rare cases, it is alright. I use screens a lot and I’m 10. I do 8th and 7th grade math (I’m in grade 5) 7th and 8th grade english, and 7th to 8th grade humanities. I am much above my class. And people in my class use screens, but they have the same mindset as you. And they fall behind. Those who use extra screens are ahead.<br><br><br>Just to make it clear, I am against using screens for non-productive things. I use them mostly for information, and that’s why I’m ahead. So depending on how you use screens, it can be good or bad."
ndOB-vXwXxM,"@Chill pill 201 I don&#39;t think it&#39;s good for anybody at any age, I think that&#39;s been well established. I&#39;d go with the WHO and avoid most screens until a child is five. Personally I&#39;d discourage screen use as much as possible after that, these days a healthy and well-balanced young person will be far ahead of their peers."
ndOB-vXwXxM,He will outgrows in future stop his screen time
ndOB-vXwXxM,because of genetics or screens

u49uLLCUlEk,@Lelwani Dingir how do u do tht ? <br><br>Am a trilingual and sometimes i dunno which language should i speak to my child !<br>Mainly i speak english but i would love for her to speak other languages like me !
u49uLLCUlEk,"Raising a bilingual too! Almost two now, but it&#39;s incredible how much they learn. She knows exactly which language to speak to whom and sometimes correctly translates words for me."
u49uLLCUlEk,My wife has been doing this with our 18 month old since he was born and says people look at her like she&#39;s crazy 🤣. Now he has a vocab of hundreds of words and often speaks in sentences 😁
u49uLLCUlEk,I was thinking the same thing. It couldn&#39;t have been the first time he encountered a situation that generated an impulse to talk. I tend to think he struggled with properly constructing proper sentences and wouldn&#39;t speak because of it.
u49uLLCUlEk,It’s to make a point
u49uLLCUlEk,P
u49uLLCUlEk,P
u49uLLCUlEk,Ok. Will try to do better going forward
u49uLLCUlEk,It’s not! First 5 years are the best!
u49uLLCUlEk,"It&#39;s not a myth, is a generalization because IN THE MAJORITY of the cases it works this way. What you are talking is about exceptions: they confirm the rule. I believe I have a large vocabulary of english words and I live outside my native country for over 20 years, but compared with my own native language and it&#39;s nuances my understanding of english is quite limited. People should stop thinking that exceptions change a rule."
u49uLLCUlEk,"I  wonder if the child with Filipina Nanny lives alone in a secluded area, without the parents, and heard no other language, then the professor might have a point. If they are all living together, even the parents are not speaking with the child,  still exposed to the parents&#39; language, the professor misses the significant point of the linguistic theory on acquiring language. The story of the professor is hyperbole."
u49uLLCUlEk,"English is an official language of the Philippines, most Filipinos speak English extremely well and often mix English into their speech... this tale seems like a hyperbole."
u49uLLCUlEk,Oh my god
u49uLLCUlEk,Why? Do you look down of people who’s culture include working on rice patties? I don’t get it
u49uLLCUlEk,"@Youssra cherik my daughter is now 20 months old and she understands very well all 4 languages. I don&#39;t mix the languages, i speak each languages 2 days and change them every two days. So we have 2 days of English, 2 days of french, 2 days of kazakh and 2 days of russian. It&#39;s very important not to mix. She is now repeating small words in all 4 languages. Understands all the commands."
u49uLLCUlEk,"@Kazakh Girl in Africa <br>I speak 4 languages too (Arabic , English , French and Spanish) ..and my daughter is 1 year 3 months too .. but i only speak to her in english coz am afraid she will not catch up with me if i keep on mixing languages"
u49uLLCUlEk,"I speak to my baby in 4 languages, she is 1 year and 3 months she perfectly understands each command in all languages, French English Russian Kazakh. She loves books so much that she will chase you until you start to read or describe."
u49uLLCUlEk,"As someone who speaks 4 languages and lives in the european continent i can guarantee you, your daughter will be fine, she will be ahead of most children in the future and most important, if the logic of this video was a rule, most europeans would not also speak 4 languages fluently and europe would not be ahead of the US education system in milestones. Rest assured if you follow the correct pedagogy and education process your daughter will be fine."
u49uLLCUlEk,"I’m guessing she will learn English in school.  Assure she takes formal lessons in her second language.  For now, encourage her to express herself in both languages.  <br><br>My son grew up in mostly English speaking house and Spanish speaking extended family.  His English is impeccable (thanks to me).  Once had started formally studying Spanish he found he was better than me in one semester, and better than his dad (Spanish is mother tongue) after the first year.<br><br>He studied foreign languages in university and is now also fluent in Mandarin, Japanese, and Portuguese."
u49uLLCUlEk,"Sounds like my story. I quit my job and I stay home with my 3 and 4 year old. We used to do flash cards and lessons, they both caught on quick. Now we talk and go places. I like to see them interact with other kids and learn fro<br>Them too."
u49uLLCUlEk,I can totally relate with you
u49uLLCUlEk,I am so sorry.  All children deserve better.  Sucks we&#39;re stuck with the parents we come from with no choice when we&#39;re young.
u49uLLCUlEk,"Yeah, really distasteful, I agree. Totally unnecessary."
u49uLLCUlEk,"Yeah, I would have shared it if it weren&#39;t for that!"
u49uLLCUlEk,"I believe the purpose was to emphasize on a foriegner, by the means of an obvious image. Stereotyping is important in communication even though it might be politically incorrect. I&#39;m sorry it made you uncomfortable."
u49uLLCUlEk,"Yes! I wanted to use this video for my Child Development undergraduate course, but can not due to the racial stereotypes used. Ugh!"
u49uLLCUlEk,Absolutely Agree
u49uLLCUlEk,Noted. We’ll review this. Thanks for your comment
u49uLLCUlEk,My daughter didnt speak at 5 and at 9 years old is fluent in 4 languages. Kids are weird and very hard to judge. Dont use this video to come to any conclusions. My daughter&#39;s nannies were all foreign and spoke English as a second language yet still they were able to transfer the language enough to give her a base with which she could expand and learn English from tv and youtube etc. Language and kids are very complicated and hard to judge.
u49uLLCUlEk,She might know tons of words but simply doesn’t show that yet.
u49uLLCUlEk,"Pete’s parents wanted his nanny to ONLY speak English, which for her, was broken. She didn’t speak her native language to him. So he never learned it."
u49uLLCUlEk,But did he learn another (form of) language properly in childhood?
u49uLLCUlEk,"@K W not everyone is going to survive, sadly. Kids learn from us. Have you ever explained your feelings to a child? That’s how they learn. They learn to express themselves through the circle their born into."
u49uLLCUlEk,It’s difficult to fully enjoy how much extra there is to language under a mask. I worry about this generation of kids.
u49uLLCUlEk,"You’re right - if the kids spend a lot of time with their parents and other adults who are fluent in English/German, they’ll be okay. Your lack of fluency won’t ruin their future. It’s only a problem if the parents aren’t involved in the kids’ lives and expect the nanny to do everything with the kids."
u49uLLCUlEk,@plate of pasta Thank you for taking the time to clarify it!
u49uLLCUlEk,"No, because most multilingual kids grew up being surrounded by native speakers of different languages. Those native speakers will give them the words to describe the world around them, and the kids can convert those words to other languages. Like they may learn “apple” from one person and later learn it’s “la pomme” from another person, but either way their brain is recognizing the concept of that red fruit. And they’ll learn “Okay, this red fruit here is called either apple or la pomme depending on who I’m speaking to.” Pete’s situation is that the nanny doesn’t know the word for many concepts in English, which is depriving Pete of the chance to learn the words to describe them. And this wouldn’t happen if the nanny could speak her native language."
u49uLLCUlEk,Usually not. But it’s good if they have one language that’s spoken a lot to them by a native speaker
u49uLLCUlEk,The channel is created by some foreign nanny... 😂😂😂
u49uLLCUlEk,:)
u49uLLCUlEk,"Actually research shows that kids can learn from TV at around age 2 and older, but if they’re younger than that it isn’t beneficial."
u49uLLCUlEk,"They completely missed the point of learning and acquiring a language, whoever made this video did not take a further look into these basic differences."
u49uLLCUlEk,What is your native language? Speak to your kids in that language.
u49uLLCUlEk,@K W what did you read about the formula? pls share. i love reading about researches
u49uLLCUlEk,"I had found a study indicating infant boys in high fluoride areas had a lower IQ at age 4 than other boys. This same study found no difference in girls. Another study I found on formula fed babies found differences in boys and not girls. So, yes, I do think, as you pointed out, there are gender differences. I think boys are more likely to be language delayed as well. I have been very careful what my boy has been exposed to in the water. So far, he has been very good with language. I think most forms of air pollution would probably effect both genders but it seems like boys are always at higher risk of delay."
u49uLLCUlEk,Stereotype hahahaha
u49uLLCUlEk,@K W Unfortunately some people hire others to raise their children instead of just help out. The biggest problem here was that the parents forbid the nanny from speaking in her native language. They should not have left language development up to her in that case. It had to have been obvious that she was not as fluent in English. They could easily have handled their son&#39;s English development and let the nanny speak in her native language. Then Pete would enter school speaking two languages. Then again that would require them to parent and actually interact beyond the bare minimum with their child. This is a sad story as it sounds like Pete is being neglected by his parents.
u49uLLCUlEk,@plate of pasta Pete never had parents who spoke to him? Were his parents famous movie stars or something?
u49uLLCUlEk,"Did your family speak another language with you before age 6? If they did, then your brain already built the neural pathways for languages, and that makes it easier to convert that to English. Your situation is different than Pete’s. The video is saying that Pete’s brain is forming differently than Lucy’s (and yours) because he had a childhood deprived of enriching language experiences. If the nanny spoke to Pete entirely in her native language, he may have been on the same level as Lucy when he goes to school and begins learning English words to replace the foreign language words he already knew."
u49uLLCUlEk,"@David Wright I suspect you may not be giving your wife enough credit. Though even native speakers may struggle with the children’s story. I’m not sure about the emotions for a dragon eating tacos. However, I can say ow or ouch, with emotion, in languages I can’t even speak. You can also express excitement, fear, sadness, joy without language. Still I standby speaking other languages to my child and I would encourage rather than discourage people to do the same.  As far as cognitive load goes, if that’s an issue, there are ways to reduce it if reading a children’s story as per your example.  The one real advantage a native speaker has is not emotion, but rather the phonetics of the language. If that is a concern, YouTube is a great resource for children songs by native speakers to aid in creating phonemic awareness at an early age."
u49uLLCUlEk,"@K W adding emotional context to a story by using your voice to express excitement, fear, sadness, joy etc is skill that needs spare cognitive capacity for contemporaneous interpretation and a nuanced understanding of the language used. This is something that someone with a basic conversational English as a second language would struggle with doing when reading a story to a child. While a native speaker will do this automatically. <br><br>My wife is a second language English speaker at ILETs 6.5-7 standard (much better than the nanny here who is probably a 4-4.5) and has completed a master’s degree in English (so functionally better than the mother in this example) is much less able to put emotional expression into a story when reading to our daughter than I am, as a native speaker, even with a familiar text."
u49uLLCUlEk,At a very young age before year one is over.
u49uLLCUlEk,"@Samickill well, you are right, the comment does imply that. However, it starts with “the moral of the story”, and the story was only about learning English. There was child A, a girl, who learned English from her Native English speaking mom. Then child B, a boy, who apparently had no parents and only learned English from the non-Native English speaking Asian Nanny who could not read a story with emotion. My interpretation was the commenter was saying the nanny of the boy should speak her native language to him instead of English. There’s a lot wrong with this story and I agree the boy would benefit from exposure to a foreign language especially since I believe that our ability to produce and distinguish foreign language sounds (phonemic comprehension) occurs early and then is much more difficult later in life. However, the moral should not be that you cannot read a book to your child in non-Native language. I have spoken English, Japanese, and a few other languages to my child. He benefited from it for several reasons in my opinion and I can express emotion in the languages. You don’t lose a capacity to speak with emotion when speaking another language. I do not know where people seem to get that from?"
u49uLLCUlEk,"@K W Oh, I thought the original comment was addressing the fact that children can learn multiple languages at the same time."
u49uLLCUlEk,"It’s possible to speak from the heart in a second language. Kids in multi-lingual houses will often appear to have less language to the outside world, but, in truth, will have more total language because they are learning vocabulary in more languages. Eventually, the multi-lingual kid will catch up and exceed the monolingual kid in total language ability and knowledge.  The multi-lingual kid will have a broader world and advantages beyond what the mono-lingual kid may ever have the capacity for even as an adult. In which case, it won’t matter what their kindergarten teacher thought at 4 years of age. BTW, It’s fine if the nanny spoke English to the kid. I don’t know where the creator got their information from but it wasn’t a linguist."
u49uLLCUlEk,It&#39;s an oversimplification. How would you represent a foreigner?
u49uLLCUlEk,"Quick, let&#39;s cancel everything!!"
u49uLLCUlEk,"If you take out the rice hat I think it would actually be a sort of classical scenario. The rice hat was a great visual aid tho. Not all the people in the world dress the same, you know?"
u49uLLCUlEk,"Hi Amal AlKibsi! Thank you for the comment. We are currently working with our community to translate our videos. Please stay tuned!"
u49uLLCUlEk,He won&#39;t be bilingual because the nanny is not allowed to speak to him in her mother tongue. Such a shame.
u49uLLCUlEk,"He won’t be bilingual, the language needs to be shared with the child in a meaningful way, clearly in this scenario the nanny only communicate with the child in broken English. What does stereotypes have to do with the subject at hand, stop trying to interject your cult into important conversations. It’s not about your cults beliefs it’s about creating better futures for our children."
u49uLLCUlEk,its not true

u49uLLCUlEk,@Sara Mohammad A 3 year old close to my friend spoke three languages at the age of three. The French Father only spoke to her in French. The German mother only spoke to her in German. The maid just spoke English.
u49uLLCUlEk,"MWSARSCA thanks for replying! My family is a little concerned bc my brother who is almost three isnt speaking as much as he should for his age. That combined with the issue of learning multiple languages is a little stressful, so i really appreciate your response."
u49uLLCUlEk,"I don&#39;t think its difficult or would necessarily lead to confusion. I learnt not two, but three, languages as a child. What is decisive is that children grow in an environment where both languages are not just formally taught but are also spoken routinely. What this video stresses on is that there are limits on what can be learned through formal teaching. It is important, in order for a language to be learnt by a kid properly, that the kid grows up hearing the language in normal social settings. <br><br>In your kid&#39;s case, he or she should have no difficulty learning English cuz all the kids around him or her in school would be speaking in English. For learning Arabic, as it is unlikely that many kids would be speaking Arabic in school, it is necessary that Arabic is spoken by the kid&#39;s parents at home. If that happens, I don&#39;t see why your kid should have problems learning both languages. <br><br>But don&#39;t expect your kid to learn Arabic very well if the parents aren&#39;t usually conversing in Arabic. Even if you hire a tutor, the gains will be limited."

u49uLLCUlEk,"Hi Basma, there is really no problem with raising a kid bilingual if both parents speak their native tongue! It is only important that you will speak your native language and your husband his, when communicating with the child. In many families this even leads to tri-lingual upbringing because kids are exposed to the native tongue of each parent plus the language the parents use to communicate with each other / or the language spoken at school.  Negative effects may come from the good will of many parents to speak in a language to their child that is not their own native one, hence using poor vocabulary and grammar. All the best to you and your family!"
u49uLLCUlEk,"Cool, explain the european continent then, actually please explain us in the UK, officially we speak english, but people in wales will speak welsh and people in the north of scotland scotish gaelic, they will also speak english as bilinguals to a native level. The entire european continent is bilingual and they are milestones ahead in education and development than the US. This video showed nothing than stereotypes and a terrible explanation on learning and acquisition with no scientific support, not even a theory of pedagogy whatsoever to explain bilingual development and change the stereotype of multicultural and multilingual peoples, which for us in europe is the common to have both ways in our lives. I used to enjoy this channel, until this video happened...a child development is based on correct pedagogy procedures and acquisition, obviously they should have offered a better example to show how your child can be proper bilingual."

Which could make sense considering my older brother had dyslexia. <br>Im going to research it and find out more about it. I wonder if dyslexia also creates behavioral problems??? <br>But thanks anyway and looking forward to your next video. <br>Might i suggest a video on how to push and reprimand children that have low self esteem... toddler that arent too sure in themselves"
u49uLLCUlEk,"Many children know much more than what they show. So I’m not sure. Nobody can. But if your kids are being loved and have a positive sense of self, you for sure didn’t mess them up. If there father was not around much to speak in French and your French isn’t strong, English could have been a good alternative. But maybe it’s not even too late to switch, if everyone around them speaks French and you can express yourself better using English. One other possibility is that your children might experience dyslexia. Unlike many think, it’s not a spelling but a speaking problem and usually rubs in genes. Richard Brandson has it. And the founder of IKEA had it as well. <br><br>Regardless. The best you can do is to speak, or have your husband speak to your children as much as possible. Again, direct speech is what counts."
u49uLLCUlEk,Sprouts will they learn in school the same amount of words they learned from their parents?
u49uLLCUlEk,"I don’t think it does. Maybe in the first 6 month of grade one, but not after."
u49uLLCUlEk,@Tony Broman  I wish more people could read your comment in relation to the above statements. This response is quite mature and well composed. This mind set is perfect for teaching on all levels.. cheers to minds such as ours!  @Carrie Bennett  it’s just perspective! See how everyone agrees not with your perspective… try to get the message and less of the attachment issues
u49uLLCUlEk,Agree. I am Vietnamese and found that part very distasteful.
u49uLLCUlEk,@Carrie Bennett all that is done solely for an example
u49uLLCUlEk,"@Carrie Bennett  first of all, they were not trying to blame everything on the nani, it was only an example! Second, I have a neighbor that have a foreign nani and they tell her to talk to their kid only in English, it’s more common than you think!"
u49uLLCUlEk,"Blah, blah, blah… if there’s nothing to distinguish the lady people would think… she could be an Asian American or any other potential combination of ethnicity… England has a lot of Asia looking native speakers for instance"
u49uLLCUlEk,you should utilize your library more . atleast you know its your fault. just set an alarm and read and directly talk to them all day long.
u49uLLCUlEk,I really 😁 appreciate you with your comment.. (◠‿◕)
u49uLLCUlEk,"Thank you for your honesty. And yes there still is time. I wish you all the strength and energy to do what you know is right. It’s not always possible, but we can try. And if we fail, let’s try again tomorrow. I wish you well! Jonas"
u49uLLCUlEk,You are getting there.
u49uLLCUlEk,@K W This is a very good point and demonstrates perfectly why the people that children socialize with actually matter.
u49uLLCUlEk,Lucy may not keep any advantage if she slows down her learning to better fit in with her peer group.
u49uLLCUlEk,Try not to pressure your future kids to be geniuses. Just provide the environment for them to flourish.
u49uLLCUlEk,"Take me instead, I will treat u a billion times better than your own child i swear"
u49uLLCUlEk,@kooky croon be MY sugar daddy
u49uLLCUlEk,@kooky croon wth
u49uLLCUlEk,"Yes. He&#39;ll learn something. Hopefully, not just how to manipulate with his words, to get away w/ and lying,* about his BULLYING behavior.<br>And worse behaviors as he never matures throughout his Adulthood."
u49uLLCUlEk,Thank you Zachary for sharing your view!
u49uLLCUlEk,M M that’s true but I would like to have kids and I no longer would like them to say potato or anime hahaha✨
u49uLLCUlEk,Not everyone needs to have kids.
u49uLLCUlEk,Of course a gacha user would say this
u49uLLCUlEk,YES !!!
u49uLLCUlEk,I think we are already seeing the fruit of that.
u49uLLCUlEk,"A collection of unrefined minds in a world that demands more creativity than it ever has. <br>Just look at today&#39;s world and how the average person and the general public can so easily do stupid things while thinking themselves as geniuses. This two part combination is how conspiracies built on nothing but lies and conjecture are created. Take the idea that masks will kill you in seconds or minutes after putting them on. Those who are properly educated know that this idea is totally wrong. <br><br>But what about the adults of today that were neglected as children? They had to learn the world with proverbial scraps of knowledge. Learning in this manner will create gaps in understanding and frustration because those gaps exist. This frustration can then cause the person to lash out at ideas they do not understand which in turn means they can hardly ever, if ever at all learn what they missed out on in early life. Thus the neglected child turned unrefined adult has a mountain to climb with no tools in trying to live their life.<br><br><br>if humanity doesn&#39;t break this cycle knowledge will have a split similar to wealth in that the top 1% of people have 99% of the knowledge."
u49uLLCUlEk,I would also like to see a video on schemas as well.
u49uLLCUlEk,"I think Pete will actually be ahead in the long run, because he had a bilingual nanny. If or not she spoke directly to him in her native tongue or not, he spent his earliest years hearing it. No doubt she spoke on her phone, spoke to others outside, and most likely substituted words she didnt know with words she did. His chances of being a successful bilingual speaker are going to be much higher than a child not exposed to other language groups."
u49uLLCUlEk,"@Warlock Paladin I&#39;ve been actively improving my written and spoken English for around 8 years now. I still make sure I research a words definition of its new to me or if I kind of forget it because of lack of use (can&#39;t tell you how many times I looked up &quot;bipolar&quot; and &quot;gaslighting&quot; after every time I hear it in a video every few weeks). I try to put most of my thoughts to typed words in comments, reread old comments if I get a notification or watch an older video, read comments by other people and sometimes create scripts that never see the light of day. I also work for an American animation studio, so I get to practice my spoken English a lot too which isn&#39;t yet up to par with my written one simply due to comparatively lacking in practice (only around 3-4 years).<br><br>It&#39;s not easy and there are of course some downsides. My local language (Hebrew) suffers quite a bit because I don&#39;t interact with it except when talking to my dad and sister and I also lost a bit of fluency in Russian because I only practice it when speaking to my mom or grandma and sometimes if I put a show in Russian in the background while I work just to retain it a little better due to lack of practice. I prefer English to both Russian and Hebrew. I find it more pleasant to listen to and it&#39;s extremely rich in its ability to express oneself in detail and adding context to your ideas and thoughts.<br><br>tl;dr<br>8 years. Hope this was what you were looking for 😅"
u49uLLCUlEk,"Out of curiosity, how long have you been working on your English? (it seems quite natural as well as educated)"
u49uLLCUlEk,@NathZ ?
u49uLLCUlEk,Thanks for helping me with my homework
u49uLLCUlEk,"@Martin Swift P.S. If I&#39;m jumping to conclusions, what are you doing in your original comment? Hypocritical much? ;)"
u49uLLCUlEk,@Martin Swift I do not want to engage further with you - unless you can support your own case with reason and without ad hominems. :)
u49uLLCUlEk,"​@Martin Swift I&#39;d love if you could just answer my first question and not get philosophical with me about objectivity/subjectivity; without giving me new examples about flags; without having to ask me three questions back before you&#39;re able to answer mine. <br>In your very first comment, you suggested that this video is racist. You should be able to explain why without dodging endlessly. If you can&#39;t, you must be virtue signalling."
u49uLLCUlEk,"@Martin Swift Notice how you&#39;ve still not answered how the hat is racist. Instead you&#39;re asking me questions back as well as accusing me. Yes, I completely agree with you - context matters, which is why I&#39;m certain the nanny in this particular video is wearing that hat merely to emphasize having a different accent, not to somehow be racist. But hey, as long as you can&#39;t say what&#39;s racist about it, I&#39;ll have to assume that you&#39;re only here to gain a sense of importance by calling others racist (and me blinded and biased when I disagree with you)."
u49uLLCUlEk,"@Mikkel Søefeldt Also, that (condescending?) comment that “Asian people exist too you know” all while seemingly unfamiliar with the context seems a little Dunning-Kruger to me. Again: The context is the whole point. Just because you don&#39;t see it, doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s not there."
u49uLLCUlEk,"@Jordan Lane-Miller thanks for your support, if you one day come to Egypt I can help you to visit pyramids:-)"
u49uLLCUlEk,@Sayed Salah keep at it... You will amaze yourself with what you will eventually do!!!
u49uLLCUlEk,I have been learning English for 5years but unfortunately I can&#39;t to reach to fluency 😕
u49uLLCUlEk,We get what we pay for or work for. Nobody is handing out a free education.
u49uLLCUlEk,You sound very well spoken! Keep reading books and surround yourself with people that speak well and don’t use slang! I was raised well but later surrounded myself with people who used CA slang and it really hindered my speaking ability I believe. Too many “dudes!” And “totallyy’s” that still come out. Hard habit to break!
u49uLLCUlEk,"Reading what you&#39;ve written, you seem to me to be pretty intelligent mate. The more important thing is that you are able to identify the things that you lack - realization is the important first step."
u49uLLCUlEk,;)
u49uLLCUlEk,kim warburton you are very welcome and thanks again for your response. I appreciate all constructive feedback.
u49uLLCUlEk,@Bonka Hermit aka INTJudge thankyou :)
u49uLLCUlEk,Kim warburton Thank very much for your response and adding the information that you presented. It is really refreshing to see others actually being vocal about such important issues and I agree with you 💯 percent and salute you for your involvement. Once again I thank you for your response and appreciate it.
u49uLLCUlEk,Thanks for the thumbs up 👍 as I appreciate all constructive feedback.
u49uLLCUlEk,"I agree with you, but it&#39;s a new language besides the mother tongue. Children need a native language to establish their mental capabilities and to understand the world and them selves. In most cases, it&#39;s too late if a child has been poorly educated for a long time."
u49uLLCUlEk,"It is easier when young though ! :)<br>But it&#39;s never too late to learn indeed, it&#39;s really good for the brain to be stimulated as we grow older as it reduces memory troubles later or other intellectual deficiency that can come with age."
u49uLLCUlEk,"Thanks aymane for the good feedback! For a new language its definitely never too late, as long as you learned any language (can be also sign language) properly before age 12."
u49uLLCUlEk,@Sprouts i learned 2 language as my mother language turkish and kurdish
u49uLLCUlEk,Did you learn one language as a child that is your parents mother tongue?
u49uLLCUlEk,It is indeed naturally enticing.
u49uLLCUlEk,yup
u49uLLCUlEk,"Sprouts thank you for your good wishes and advice! I appreciate your work and find it very interesting and helpful. Of course, I’m going to maintain his mother tongue and give him as much comfort and confidence as I could. Arguably the most reasonable strategy at the situation would be to speak with him his native language at home and at the same time let him take in the new language from the outside world. Otherwise we would be like Pete’s nanny, since our mastery of the foreign language is still far from good."
u49uLLCUlEk,"Hi Nata P, I agree, of course this will be a challenge for him and for you as parents, but as long as you are strong and able to be there for him he will be fine! I think what is important, is that you will carry on to talk your mother tongue with your child, so he will feel that he can communicate well with you and he can know you understand him.  Good luck and a very good new start to you and your family!"
u49uLLCUlEk,Sezgin Özcan thank you so much!
u49uLLCUlEk,@Nata P i wish i could emigrate to a better country too good luck with your emmigration process :)
u49uLLCUlEk,Sezgin Özcan thank you for support! I’m just a typical mother who is worried about mental health and wellness of her child. 😊 But you’re right. Difficulties make us stronger. And ultimately we gain more thanks to more complicated experiences.
u49uLLCUlEk,Or we could be sarcastic jerks
u49uLLCUlEk,And someone had to say this now i&#39;ll close the video
u49uLLCUlEk,Thanks Heavy T!
u49uLLCUlEk,Thank you Sagar!

evw0h1kg-j4,Congratulations on the journey! Keep going though!!
evw0h1kg-j4,"gratulation for that. but again - this is no talk about circumstances or wealth or knowledge. it is about internal development - so that you would be exactly the same person (inner person) as you are today, despite of where you grew up. that&#39;s the study about."
evw0h1kg-j4,Hello Cathy how are you doing hope you’re doing okay ✅
evw0h1kg-j4,"I&#39;m sorry to hear that.  You&#39;re responsible for the choices that you make in your life, no one else makes your choices.  I can only hope that you will make positive choices that will improve your life, and choices that help you grow as a person.  I hope you are able to find help, and I hope that both your father and you learn how to talk to people, and more importantly each other.

evw0h1kg-j4,"it is about character, not BEHAVIOR. behavior is &quot;taught&quot;. character is not."
evw0h1kg-j4,"Agree. Each time she mentioned &quot;success&quot;, I thought: stop, I don&#39;t care about that, I wish my children feel fulfilled. She didn&#39;t make this important distinguishment."

evw0h1kg-j4,@Billy Gauthier merci :)
evw0h1kg-j4,"@konjo konjit it is a shame you haven&#39;t received more likes for your &quot;truthful comment&quot;. I&#39;m positive there are parents that purposely degrade their children out of dislike, however I think your views on why you were treated the way you were hold true much more often in society. Your words could help many people heal and give understanding to their upbringings. Thank you :)"
evw0h1kg-j4,"I think a lots of parent tend to do that ;praising someone else just to make you work harder, I think your mom might not have done that to cause you this lack of confidence,  I think its the lack of knowledge about the psychological impact that she can cause by saying those things to you. My mother also  use compare to others, saying there doing better why can’t you be like him or her . I  know it didn’t help me to get better except to cause  me low self esteem. I have kids on of my own now and I caught myself saying those things to my daughter and I try to stop it whenever I realize it. At lease it can do more damage then good. We have to reevaluate our parenting skills and interventions  to do better ."
evw0h1kg-j4,And that is not the parents fault either.
evw0h1kg-j4,"Some of us can actually DO it, lol."
evw0h1kg-j4,Lots of parents to be should go to classes 1 thé children are not yours 2 children learn from large social environment 3 children need to know you care and hear them 4 children should not be made to believe they are entitled to everything material.
evw0h1kg-j4,"Yeah but child development can also be affected by numerous aspects such as environment or gen, jumping to conclusion that those theories are fake is just unfair. I remember having read one in a reliable articles before ://"
evw0h1kg-j4,Hello Helena how are you doing hope you’re doing okay ✅
evw0h1kg-j4,"@Billy Gauthier well said! <br>It&#39;s such a pity and so unfortunate that so many so-called parents who really destroyed their children&#39;s childhoods, adult lives, and so on don&#39;t even acknowledge the mistakes they did.<br>they don&#39;t even think or feel the normal feeling of regret and they&#39;re incapable of expressing any kind of remorse or actual accountability even later in life. They feel nothing and more than &#39;I did my best&#39; a child doesn&#39;t usually hear. <br>It&#39;s just so destructive and dangerous from many points of view."
evw0h1kg-j4,"This is what many parents who made poor choices often say! It&#39;s not their fault right?... How many people who have extremely obese children that develop type 2 diabetes say &quot;I wonder how this happened, some people just get it right? &quot;? Maybe the sugar filled poptarts for breakfast, the peanut butter and jelly sandwiches for lunch and the kraft dinner for supper (I&#39;m Canadian, we don&#39;t generally say dinner) most days has something to do with it? Feed your child these poor excuses for food and their brains most likely won&#39;t fully develop and their hormones will often be imbalanced to the point where they often make poor decisions. Give your child complete freedom to watch whatever they choose on YouTube for hours on end and what morals they learn. Only people who don&#39;t blame themselves when they make mistakes in child raising because it&#39;s uncomfortable tend to believe this unsupported nonsense!"

evw0h1kg-j4,Hello Kylie how are you doing hope you’re doing okay ✅
evw0h1kg-j4,"The crux of her argument regarding how to parent was: Don&#39;t treat all your kids the same, even if they&#39;re twins. They&#39;ll still experience things differently from each-other and from you, so you need to account for that. Environment (By which I assume you mean the place and community your kid grows up in) is completely out of the scope of this talk, just parenting."

evw0h1kg-j4,Good start.
evw0h1kg-j4,"it is about child development - not experience, not knowledge, not feats - just development. sadly most people don&#39;t get that here - they set experience identical with development and knowledge. this talk here is about general development. and the study weights in the 90th percentile - not extreme situations like abuse, wealth, poorness etc."

evw0h1kg-j4,Hello Susan how are you doing hope you’re doing okay ✅
evw0h1kg-j4,"Kids tend to teach you how to parent. Genetics IS a big deal. I found my daughter I was forced to relinquish. So many similarities in interests! My daughter&#39;s first words were &quot;Star Trek&quot;,<br>my favorite show. Her adopted parents were nightmares who looked wrong from the start, but were pressed on her father and I. At one point, I asked to get her back and was refused. I&#39;m convinced $$$ was involved as the Adoptive female was 11 years older than her 19 yr. old husband! Looking back, I should have fought even harder than I already had! The abuse I had to put up with was soul-searing! <br>At our first meeting, I surprised her at college. Instead of calling, I showed up at her door!<br> She ran into my arms. I could tell by her smell that she was my child! <br>The adoptive people had wanted to be present for that first meeting, but I was finished with the desires of others who caused me so much pain. I needed privacy. That was in 1989. <br> Sorry for the rant."
evw0h1kg-j4,"&quot;And when you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by men. ... But when you pray, go into your room, close the door and pray to your Father, who is unseen. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.&quot; I&#39;m not even religious and I know this."
evw0h1kg-j4,"You definitely missed the whole point.  Her point is you can&#39;t control how the child turns out, parents can influence but not control.  Parent&#39;s are part of the environment.  Child development is complex, there are lots of things in life that will influence/affect how a child turns out such as culture, genes, the child&#39;s personality, how the child perceives an event and how the event affects the child, what the child wants, etc.  There&#39;s way too many things, that is why her video is so vague.  There is NO one answer or advice on how to make your child successful.  Her only advice to you is to live the moment with your child right now because you cannot know the future and while you can influence the child, what you do does not directly affect the outcome.  And that is the point to this video."
evw0h1kg-j4,Kids have their own minds. I don&#39;t think this lady has raised a child to adulthood.

evw0h1kg-j4,@陳郁承 maybe she does have a good point to make about something (and which is science / data based) but this speech doesn’t achieve that. Maybe she takes feedback onboard and changes her delivery to remove the obvious flaws and doubts it raises.
evw0h1kg-j4,"@NZL50505 I didn’t mention educational system at all. Actually, I said her focus was on educational style, which in essence means how parents teach their children. So her actual point is that parents are not fully in control of the development of children, yet I admit there are obvious flaws in her speech."
evw0h1kg-j4,@陳郁承 sorry but I don’t agree with you. Her lecture was not focused on the effects of the ‘education system’ but it was focused specifically on the effects of ‘parents’. Just look at the title of the lecture itself!
evw0h1kg-j4,"It&#39;s always both, never one of the two"
evw0h1kg-j4,"@Jenzo metanalyses often are difficult to draw conclusions from because they analyze so many different experiments with varying conditions. They are not science’s strongest means of experimenting, randomized controlled trials that accurately represent the sample it is studying are best. I agree with John, I found the video title misleading for the content but I sympathize with the speaker"
evw0h1kg-j4,"Finally a negative comment that has deconstructive value. Not sure though, if I would call a meta-analysis flimsy."
evw0h1kg-j4,come on you can do better than that
evw0h1kg-j4,Thanks captain obvious.
evw0h1kg-j4,Bruh so true
evw0h1kg-j4,"@Jenzo ...true, but live is what we are designed to do. So it IS the only answer.<br><br>Romans 12:10: “Be devoted to one another in love. Honor one another above yourselves. “<br><br>We’ve already been told how it all works. Why ppl constantly think they hv to keep searching for answers is mind blowing to me."
evw0h1kg-j4,"@Da Baum I assume love wasn&#39;t mentioned as a solution, because earlier in the talk she explained that the meta-analysis has suggested, that loving your child doesn&#39;t have the great effect on the development as you may think. That love can&#39;t be scientifically measured, makes this point even more intangible. Not loving your child is definitely bad for the development, everybody with a little common sense knows this. meaning, we can all assume that this women is cable of loving her remaining child and knows how important it is, as she clearly explained that she lost a child and didn&#39;t appear to be particularly thrilled."
evw0h1kg-j4,@Jenzo ...she was quoting another woman by the name of Emily Rapp. Love wasn’t mentioned as a solution in this talk at all.

evw0h1kg-j4,You shouldnt doubt that question ever.. and always doubt a parerent who dosnt understand that...
evw0h1kg-j4,Hello Danielle how are you doing hope you’re doing okay ✅
evw0h1kg-j4,I do too
evw0h1kg-j4,@Manginder Singh this is true and I can&#39;t agree more. My point was only the &quot;I really feel&quot; doesn&#39;t really count as science...
evw0h1kg-j4,@Tzadik exactly. That is how the world evolves. If you have to be a subject matter expert on everything then there is nkt enough time in the world to understand anything. This is a very important part of living in a modern world. We must have scientists to research subjects so that we can collectively learn.
evw0h1kg-j4,"I sorta know how bicycles work, but I would be lost in repairing them. I&#39;ve been cycling for 18 years. I can pump up the tires, adjust the saddle, handlebar, and I guess I can fix a chain to the cogs if I have to, but only if it&#39;s just slightly out of place. That&#39;s about it, I wouldn&#39;t know how to replace a tire or patch a puncture, for example. To add the parental perspective: My dad always rather fixed my bike for me instead of having me do it, because that was easier than teaching me. This is where the side of the child comes in though, I suppose, because I was never interested in learning about bikes. If I don&#39;t care, I usually won&#39;t remember."
evw0h1kg-j4,have scientist finally figured them out? Afaik people still don&#39;t quite know why a bicycle stays up.
evw0h1kg-j4,"Many people have excruciatingly difficult, or even abusive, family lives. I&#39;m glad you have a great family, but the idea that you have an unbreakable bond with family members is too idealistic and harmful to those in abusive situations. Sending a message that everyone should love their family can be equally harmful. I&#39;m completely aware this may not be your intention at all but it does sort of come across like that, and whilst I&#39;m not getting pissy with you I think it&#39;s a damaging notion that needs to be better, and more holistically understood. Apologies if I&#39;ve misjudged this"
evw0h1kg-j4,Are you a professional pediatrician or have you only read Thomas Boyce book?
evw0h1kg-j4,"are you citing from any research or your experience? If research, plz cite it. We&#39;ll see if they&#39;ve disentangled genes and parenting"
evw0h1kg-j4,@hani you took control of your life because it only belongs to you. You are a powerful human being.
evw0h1kg-j4,@洪家興 or you&#39;re just projecting yours on her.
evw0h1kg-j4,Everyone has some kind of trauma some of us just do the work to heal ourselves rather than make excuses to remain the same.
evw0h1kg-j4,"She is not talking about that parents can&#39;t affect their children, is about that parents can&#39;t perfectly lead thier children to success.<br>She always says that parents have to do best theirselves, but must not be obsessed with perfect parents lead to success 100%.<br>She doesn&#39;t say environment doesn&#39;t matter."
evw0h1kg-j4,"@Zack Fair what???? We don&#39;t do that in Vietnam. I remember it only happened once, just once as the case on newspaper lol, but it is really abnormal here tho 🤣"

evw0h1kg-j4,@Zack Fair Are you crazy? we don&#39;t have it in our country dude!
evw0h1kg-j4,@Zack Fair No?
evw0h1kg-j4,@Jax Turner Bro ... taking wincest too far mate ... too far
evw0h1kg-j4,Don’t do that!<br>That’s exactly how I got my kid and my crazy X.
evw0h1kg-j4,👍🏻👍🏻 her calm narrative voice started to grind my gears a bit.
evw0h1kg-j4,"It sounds like a normal person talking at 1.25 speed, and it&#39;s not terribly garbled at 2."
evw0h1kg-j4,"Yeah, you mind summerizing it?"
evw0h1kg-j4,@goji There was a movie made about the incident and it was widely publicized
evw0h1kg-j4,Sounds very anecdotal though
evw0h1kg-j4,@Jaded Monkyeah that&#39;s it 👌
evw0h1kg-j4,@Themba Mahlangu I think you might be referring to epigenetics and you&#39;re💯
evw0h1kg-j4,From that &quot;study&quot; I came away with a conclusion that it&#39;s 50/50 nurture vs nature. Which is somewhat my belief as well.
evw0h1kg-j4,"17 or 18 is just a number for legalities. Adulthood comes much later, usually.<br>If you&#39;re a confident, responsible, and independent person, you don&#39;t need to worry about the label &quot;adult&quot; anyway, people should respect you for who you are."
evw0h1kg-j4,Agreed.
evw0h1kg-j4,You can do it
evw0h1kg-j4,All the best
evw0h1kg-j4,@punk kid they are the standard at first
evw0h1kg-j4,"@punk kid ...lol! Well your sign on screams that u r a Punk Kid<br>🤷🏼‍♀️<br>Idk my friend, some parents are good &amp; some parents are bad. We humans are all doing our best to get thru this life. Nothing can be perfect in this world of outside of Jesus, so we just do our best. <br>I had narcissistically abusive parents, so I married a narcissistically abusive man (now divorced). Yet my 2 daughters and I are very close. I am a very good mom, but am in no stretch perfect. Some of us grow up, others grow into adulthood victims &amp; then victimize their own kids. <br>You get to decide who you are, and his you treat the people you love in life (kids or not). So don’t blame your parents, put them behind you &amp; strive to be better. <br>Much love! ❤️"
evw0h1kg-j4,This quote screams &quot;girlboss&quot;. Litteraly my mom says this kind of things and is just profoundly abusing under the disguise of &quot;doing her best&quot;. Parents have to be held to a certain standard in raising their kids
evw0h1kg-j4,"Yep! Just show up! Listen, watch their sports, give em hugs. Just “show up”!"
evw0h1kg-j4,Just be there and help them
evw0h1kg-j4,"Yes!  Thank you for pointing that out!  I’m a child of multiple abuse (my adoptive mother has Narcissistic Personality Disorder - how many times have I heard her call me her biggest disappointment!, for example - , my father is irresponsible and emotionally negligent - when I was 14 and told him, while crying my eyes out, that I wanted to die, his response was to ask me what I wanted for dinner, to give you an idea -, and my then-step-mother was bipolar - she poured boiling water on my arm when I was 4 years old, it was not an accident, and terrorized me for 7 years).<br><br>Oh yes, I can make direct links to why my life is where it’s at today and the struggles still present, despite my resilience (thank my genes?) and the work I’ve done.  Oh yes, I f-ing blame my parents.  Very much.<br><br>That, of course, does not mean I have to sit in a corner and wallow in self pity.  That’s not going to serve anyone.<br><br>Here’s the good news: even a stunted tree reaches for the light."
evw0h1kg-j4,@Beech Hill Labradors I’m so sorry that happened to your nephew. I see too many times people jest about how they were beaten as a child. It’s abuse and many don’t know it or refuse to see it like that but if an adult was to do that to another adult most would change their tune
evw0h1kg-j4,My nephew was punished with a belt. He hates his father wonder why?? Not!
evw0h1kg-j4,She didn&#39;t mention abusers coz she knows they can&#39;t be changed 🥲😅
evw0h1kg-j4,"@Bughuggr i cant go into your private life because i dont know anything about that, but from what you are saying you were physically punished, not abused. those are very different things. not that i am believer in physical punishment."
evw0h1kg-j4,Truee
evw0h1kg-j4,What does faith mean in the context of your sentence?
evw0h1kg-j4,@Sellintothebid what’s wrong with that though? as long as the kid enjoys it i don’t see a problem.
evw0h1kg-j4,The opposite of &quot;progressive&quot; is &quot;regressive&quot;: becoming less advanced; returning to a former or less developed state. You&#39;re not as smart as you think you are. 🤭
evw0h1kg-j4,"@Sellintothebid What&#39;s the problem with a boy who enjoys wearing dresses? Are the parents forcing him to wear them or does he have the autonomy to decide for himself? Clothes and toys should not be gendered. The only issue would be for the parents to assume he may be a girl just because he enjoys &quot;girl things&quot;, including wearing dresses. That&#39;s actually regressive."
evw0h1kg-j4,@Nun Ya I know 1. The boy is only 3 and his parents dress him up in girls dresses.... there really is crazy out there.  I live in communist California btw

6jUv3gDAM1E,There shouldn’t be a “cure.” Let people be who they are. Autistic people aren’t abominations.
6jUv3gDAM1E,No
6jUv3gDAM1E,"There&#39;s no healing, lmao."
6jUv3gDAM1E,@Blitz_1337 Should I be concerned that you wanted to watch a YouTube video of an autopsy?
6jUv3gDAM1E,"I&#39;m  an autistic male and I still embrace my family so, it&#39;s just you with the &quot;physical interaction bad&quot; thing."
6jUv3gDAM1E,I came here because I misspelled Autopsy
6jUv3gDAM1E,Also thats how I was/am im 20 I wish it went away it just got better were kinda drivers of our own boats and we don&#39;t like people trying to take the wheel. Doesn&#39;t mean we&#39;re good ones
6jUv3gDAM1E,If its adhd thats a genetic condition and it&#39;s likely the father was born with it or you have it and are coping either really well or discretely though it can develop on its own maybe I dunno i just know its mostly genetic
6jUv3gDAM1E,This video is very interesting you should check it out
6jUv3gDAM1E,Dude getting therapy isn’t ableist what’s wrong with you?
6jUv3gDAM1E,Wdym?
6jUv3gDAM1E,"Hey! Don’t worry so much. ❤️the Autism is a gift, a pure heart. <br>1-Don’t let things overwhelmed you. <br>2-Provide therapies for your child will help her to be more conscious and provide a diet without gluten and healthy. (I recommend to watch videos regarding the diet for kids with autism, it really helps).<br><br>✨You have a gift to take care of!"
6jUv3gDAM1E,You shouldn’t tho
6jUv3gDAM1E,"If another member of their family has it then it does slightly increase the chance that your friend has it too, but i wouldn&#39;t assume or diagnose from your perspective."
6jUv3gDAM1E,This reminds me of this girl I know wouldnt stop calling me autistic and doesnt understand that cats know how to fly so I accidentally threw my hands at my wifes face to prove her wrong
6jUv3gDAM1E,🙋
6jUv3gDAM1E,"Nope, not alone. Not bad either."
6jUv3gDAM1E,Nope
6jUv3gDAM1E,Well I think of myself being a Maker of an Animated Web series since 2001 to 2013. And is born in Jan 9th 1973
6jUv3gDAM1E,No 💕
6jUv3gDAM1E,@DesiredFears Same
6jUv3gDAM1E,@An Angry Juicebox Thanks.
6jUv3gDAM1E,Opinion Respected
6jUv3gDAM1E,"everyone&#39;s situation is different, but it is common that autism can be improve throughout your son&#39;s life . It also depends if the person as severe autism of less severe autism. You just have to be the best parent that you could be for your son and have lots of  patience. I&#39;m sure it&#39;s hard on him too. It&#39;s not his fault that he has autism. Please continue to love and support your son. He needs you the most.. This is coming from a person who has PDD-NOS."
6jUv3gDAM1E,I read it! You are welcome!
6jUv3gDAM1E,"@Ethereal_Angelz❤️ I&#39;m only 14. Everyone is telling me what I can and can&#39;t do with my life. I&#39;m the same person, just with a diagnosis."
6jUv3gDAM1E,"@i couldn&#39;t think of anything Uhh? I&#39;m sorry but, I&#39;m only 15 and how do I know any tips. I think anyone can have a baby, even autistic girls (as long as they are capable enough for them to look after) ."
6jUv3gDAM1E,"Hey, I&#39;m on the spectrum and my teachers are now telling me I won&#39;t be able to have kids or find love because of it. I&#39;m the same person just with a diagnosis. Any tips?"
6jUv3gDAM1E,"I have autism and I am NOT hindered by it, it makes me less socially aware and unable to read people due to their brimming social masking but it makes me more logical and  actually mildly improves my intelligence."
6jUv3gDAM1E,What?
6jUv3gDAM1E,@i couldn&#39;t think of anything true that
6jUv3gDAM1E,"@kittygamer45_tv Those who mind don&#39;t matter, those who matter don&#39;t mind."
6jUv3gDAM1E,"@i couldn&#39;t think of anything couldn&#39;t agree more. I&#39;m 16 and I&#39;m still trying to come to terms with it also. I&#39;ve been doing a lot of research and I think I&#39;m close to understanding it. I&#39;m just glad that I&#39;m not alone. My classmates don&#39;t understand why it takes me longer to do something right. But the best thing about all of this is that, we don&#39;t care about what others think of us. I&#39;m happy with myself. Other people don&#39;t see that because deep down; we all are human. I feel as if everyone should be aware of autism. To fully understand it. <br><br>I&#39;m glad I made your day better! Remember this: the strongest people get the most toughest challenges. Meaning; we face the world head on. And that&#39;s a good thing. It may not be seen as of right now. But, everyone is different. This society we live in just doesn&#39;t see it yet. Keep moving forward. <br><br>Have a great night/day!!!"
6jUv3gDAM1E,@kittygamer45_tv You are preaching to the choir my friend! I had trouble coming to terms with my ASD until I realized that more people are on the spectrum than people think. Vaccines don&#39;t magically make someone who was Neurotypical not with a needle. Drives me insane!
6jUv3gDAM1E,"@i couldn&#39;t think of anything haha. No problem. I&#39;m just tired of the whole vaccine conspiracies. I don&#39;t understand why people think autism is a disease. I hate when people try to say ASD is contagious. Even though I have it; I still have no idea what it is or how to explain it to someone.<br><br> I also have ADHD. The two combined is harder for me to understand and concentrate on instructions and stuff like that. I&#39;m just trying to make everyone aware and call them out about the whole vaccine thing. <br><br>Again, your welcome!!! 😉"
6jUv3gDAM1E,Awesome!
6jUv3gDAM1E,I have ASD and I&#39;ve only gotten like few Vaccines when i was born.
6jUv3gDAM1E,Autism isn&#39;t something you can grow out of. It&#39;s a neurological condition that literally effects brain structure. So to get over autism would be the same as restructuring the neurological processes in your head
6jUv3gDAM1E,@Hi that’s what they all say babe ;) ok i&#39;m just joking but yeah that is not autism at all.
6jUv3gDAM1E,"@VanillaSky yeah, I always smile a lot but I don’t have autism."
6jUv3gDAM1E,"I don&#39;t think that&#39;s autism at all lol. Many girls are like this, smiling a lot and feeling a lot of emotions when they like someone. I think it&#39;s a wonderful thing to feel good emotions just by someone sitting next to you. I mean who the fuck doesn&#39;t? That&#39;s not autism bro."
6jUv3gDAM1E,we live in a society
6jUv3gDAM1E,"That is true, although society is composed of people.<br><br>&quot;Think of how stupid the average person is, and realize that half of them are stupider than that.&quot; -George Carlin"
6jUv3gDAM1E,"Please don’t go around diagnosing people, it’s not productive and it is not accurate"
6jUv3gDAM1E,"That&#39;s impossible, because it is immense. You can not like social situations, you can find lights insanely bright. You can not be able to tune out a single sound so everything is deafening. You can not be able to speak properly, or you can be ridiculously smart. You can get overly anxious, or really angry. Sometimes too many things build up and you reach a meltdown. It ranges massively and is different for everyone. Some people who have it are almost completely normal, and you may never think they have it."
6jUv3gDAM1E,@Golden Angel Ahhh...I don&#39;t know...just stop talking to me okay? It&#39;s getting on my nerves
6jUv3gDAM1E,@Golden Angel I Have Autism...and yes...that <b>sometimes</b> happens!
6jUv3gDAM1E,@PAPPA RAPPA! may I ask am I behave and act differently due to stress?
6jUv3gDAM1E,Yes
6jUv3gDAM1E,Sounds like a typical thought of a child that’s not matured into a man yet
6jUv3gDAM1E,@dzhellek that’s what I do
6jUv3gDAM1E,Please let me know if you figured the answer 🙄
6jUv3gDAM1E,"You’ve messed me up, and I greatly appreciate it."
6jUv3gDAM1E,"@Az cardinalds23 Hi, iam an healer n dealing with this kind of cases been long do let me know if u need my help <br>Thanku"
6jUv3gDAM1E,Meditation
6jUv3gDAM1E,"I am not diagnosed with ADHD but I&#39;m pretty sure i do have and one of the things that really affect me is getting angry easily. I would recommend maybe like punching a pillow, or punching your bed, screaming into a pillow, or ripping paper apart. I can&#39;t get my anger out unless I do it physically, maybe u might wanna join sport&#39;s like boxing."
6jUv3gDAM1E,"A lot of shy and insecure people don&#39;t look in the  eyes a lot. It requires practice. Some don&#39;t have the willpower to watch directly in the eyes or just watch for 2 seconds and then stare away. I have no autism and i have no problem share a conversation and make a good eye contact, but we all have bad days and when i&#39;m not feeling my best i tend to look in the eyes but  turn away every 2-3 seconds. I don&#39;t think this eye contact thing has anything to do with autism, most autistic kids don&#39;t literally ever look into the eyes or just stare 5% in the eyes and 95% stare something else i guess. Also many people have social anxiety, shyness ( especially cute girls i have met ) and aren&#39;t very confident. It&#39;s normal. What is not normal when you&#39;re a fucking weirdo creep dude who has no boundaries of others, is basically an idiotic robot who has literally no social skills at  all who has problems with learning and everything else."
6jUv3gDAM1E,Me too!   I am glad you brought that up!I Would love to look people in the eye!  More to that......
6jUv3gDAM1E,Albert einstein was also on the spectrum

6jUv3gDAM1E,@Jack fay yes
6jUv3gDAM1E,@Max Screw wth WHY? What did they ever do to you
6jUv3gDAM1E,So how did it go away? My son is 2.5 he do this
6jUv3gDAM1E,@Max Screw uh- nobody asked but thanks i guess??? Uhhmn- yeah-
6jUv3gDAM1E,@Sonu kumar wtf you beat her????
6jUv3gDAM1E,@Some person I am sry but this may seem dumb..my sis yes you can see her in the profile pic has autism..she is 12..turning teen ..I know normally all kids go through puberty..me being teen myself but she has more anger issues and repeats stuff loves sticky stuff gets super hyper..and cant seem to be under control..how should I help her..of course therapy she gets it..but honestly when I get frustrated I beat her..I don&#39;t want to do that but
6jUv3gDAM1E,@BOOTY JOOSE literally screamed!! 23 and yes.
6jUv3gDAM1E,I feel like it can when caught at an early age. If the brain is still developing why can’t autism be faded away with training and helping that child with those problem area’s
6jUv3gDAM1E,@Ananya damn 😭
6jUv3gDAM1E,@Max Screw right back at ya bby
6jUv3gDAM1E,@damn oh that&#39;s great to hear
6jUv3gDAM1E,I’m autistic and I don’t go to a special needs school but it’s hard my parents have to help me all the time because I have a hard time learning listening and reading so I always need extra help
6jUv3gDAM1E,@Jack fay 😊😊😊😊
6jUv3gDAM1E,@Max Screw Why? Thats really mean.  Just bc ur online it doesn&#39;t mean u get to say whatever u want. I bet you wouldn&#39;t say that out loud in public or to someone. Its not the their fault for having autism. They are still human. Go educate yourself on accepting others disabilities.
6jUv3gDAM1E,Every autistic child gets special needs I have special needs too but my I rarely need my sna but I do need it since I&#39;m autistic and my sna is not alone I have special needs with another boy which I&#39;m happy about so it&#39;s not only me in my class :D
6jUv3gDAM1E,He very well could be right my friend.
6jUv3gDAM1E,He isn&#39;t necessarily wrong. Just because the experts or enough people believe something doesn&#39;t make it true. Science proves itself wrong all the time.
6jUv3gDAM1E,Its like the dad version of the water boys mom.
6jUv3gDAM1E,Lol
6jUv3gDAM1E,I do to and I do not want to be 62 million that’s to low I want to be like the 20393 billion people

6jUv3gDAM1E,@lou I dont particularly care as it really isn&#39;t an insult in my opinion.
6jUv3gDAM1E,That’s incredibly ableist and offensive
6jUv3gDAM1E,@decomposingfrogs Oh I did alright! He always gpt so extremely defensive.
6jUv3gDAM1E,"@ZX15 No way, I despise Trump. Even if someone comes from a family of doctors, it takes a lot of tests to diagnose someone, and it&#39;s usually by a psychiatrist. Always argue using facts and general sense to back yourself up."
6jUv3gDAM1E,"@decomposingfrogs Well I did have someone who claimed he came from a family of doctors, who supposedly told people I had ADHD, only to find he was homeless, and a registered sex offender.  Same personality as Trump, only he&#39;s a bum. Sorry if you&#39;re a supporter."
6jUv3gDAM1E,Oh. Dw they’re young in the grand scheme of things
6jUv3gDAM1E,"@Coco Don&#39;t worry about them, they&#39;re just a spammer"
6jUv3gDAM1E,@Max Screw Um.. Why?
6jUv3gDAM1E,@Skelly Cat Yes! I was diagnosed with autism recently! I took longer than I expected but now I know that I do in fact have ASD! :D
6jUv3gDAM1E,I have autism too we found out when I was 4 years old
6jUv3gDAM1E,Have you gotten any diagnosis yet? 🙃I didn’t have a diagnosis assessment I found out in my neurology and the guy told us it was in my files since like 2017 (it was 2019 when we found out) that was fun. Just remember even if your undiagnosed your ASD is still valid 😄
6jUv3gDAM1E,What&#39;s your point?
6jUv3gDAM1E,@Koki Seiso dym this comment section or in general?
6jUv3gDAM1E,@Koki Seiso no were not???
6jUv3gDAM1E,If somebody ask me something I freeze even if the question is “do you want this <i>__</i> food”
6jUv3gDAM1E,If you have autism I understand bit if you don’t have autism that comment is not funny at all
6jUv3gDAM1E,He didn&#39;t type this it&#39;s a bot giving false info. Don&#39;t believe it someone else said this exact same thing!
6jUv3gDAM1E,"i can’t believe you actually typed this out and then posted it,, like dude. gluten doesnt cause autism and this whole post is just so ableist i cant,,"
6jUv3gDAM1E,@JoelTT <br>I am going to try it with my son I know two people that the situation happened to and due to them being allergic to gluten cause them to have brain fog and not be themselves it’s worth a try before having my two year old evaluated and diagnosed having to pay a lot of money if it can just be an allergic reaction to gluten! <br>It may work for some but not for everyone it depends on your child’s circumstances he’s just giving his story on what happened to his child!
6jUv3gDAM1E,"@Joy Herring Whether you’re autistic or not will not change based on your diet. However if your child struggles because of gluten, cut it out of their diet, that is not an advice specific to parents with an autistic child, it’s an advice to ALL parents!"
6jUv3gDAM1E,"@Joy Herring It could be false information, you know."
6jUv3gDAM1E,@disa how do you know did you try it??? It makes sense unhealthy food makes for an unhealthy body you are what you eat I say it’s worth a try.
6jUv3gDAM1E,"@Coco Even if they did have autism it still shouldn’t be used as an excuse. An explanation yes, but not an excuse."
6jUv3gDAM1E,"@The iSheep It is a condition, nonetheless."
6jUv3gDAM1E,"@Coco don&#39;t listen to him, his mama raised a disappointment."
6jUv3gDAM1E,"@Coco <b>haha, i&#39;m in danger</b>"
6jUv3gDAM1E,Eggs are fine. It&#39;s people I can&#39;t stand.
6jUv3gDAM1E,no wonder im underweight
6jUv3gDAM1E,Feel ya man. I absolutely hate any egg that isn’t a creme egg
6jUv3gDAM1E,"@ninja doge It&#39;s the smell that does it for me, and the texture, I literally can&#39;t be near an egg without feeling like gagging"
6jUv3gDAM1E,"Ikr! I they just feel and look wierd, I like them sometimes but they disgust me"
6jUv3gDAM1E,Based
6jUv3gDAM1E,@Tena Defiant what’s that other reason?🤔
6jUv3gDAM1E,Totally not where I thought the comment was going after the first half 😂
6jUv3gDAM1E,@adrian ortiz That user is a liar. Ignore.
6jUv3gDAM1E,@Shr00mBean I’m not trolling I’m being deadly serious
6jUv3gDAM1E,@MynameisTMP-0134 Maybe you should practice your social skills because telling people to kill themselves is not okay.
6jUv3gDAM1E,I need context. What does this guy mean?
6jUv3gDAM1E,@DR DOOMER What do you mean?
6jUv3gDAM1E,we&#39;re not robots
6jUv3gDAM1E,"Dude, autistic people are emotional oceans. I&#39;m not exactly sure what you are referring but if you are saying that autistic people have no emotions that&#39;s only what it looks like on the outside. Complete opposite on the inside."
6jUv3gDAM1E,@filipeflowerTrue
6jUv3gDAM1E,"This doesn&#39;t happen to everybody, you know."
6jUv3gDAM1E,@Poopy poopy Butt yeah?
6jUv3gDAM1E,Sorry I dont know if ladder part of sentense was clear;         Takes place of the word.......AND and the word....OR.
6jUv3gDAM1E,@Sadnessboi 2 commas can be used as a pause.  Also take place of  and  or  .
6jUv3gDAM1E,@69 A sad  and lonely person!Very sorry! more to say .......If you want...ball is in your court.
6jUv3gDAM1E,I always think I might accidently swallow one ect I am scared of bones in fowl or fish.
6jUv3gDAM1E,"@69 If you want to know the definition of Ad Hominem, you have Google to figure that out"
6jUv3gDAM1E,same
6jUv3gDAM1E,Ms. Smith I hope you and your kid is ok and better than before.
6jUv3gDAM1E,Same lol
6jUv3gDAM1E,Hope everything’s okay🥺 my prayers out to you
6jUv3gDAM1E,"@HalfAssRanch Adhd and Autism have a 60% comorbidity rate, so it’s very likely. When doctors say they have a lot of overlapping symptoms it’s normally them saying “your kid is autistic but we don’t want to diagnose him so here’s an adhd diagnosis”. I’ve seen it time and time again."
6jUv3gDAM1E,"@HalfAssRanch I agree, you want to raise your kids to be strong and resilient, no matter what. Everyone has something going on with them, but that is only a limitation if we think of it in that way."
6jUv3gDAM1E,"Right??? Like- &quot;Food Preference&quot;. I don&#39;t have a food preference- I have a severe sensory reaction to some foods. It&#39;s not, &quot;oh, I don&#39;t like this food&quot;, it&#39;s more like... if you put a whole live bee in your mouth. It&#39;s a deeply distracting, unpleasant, and frustrating experience. But nobody would say they&#39;d &quot;prefer not to&quot; put a bee in their mouth- they just couldn&#39;t handle doing that."
6jUv3gDAM1E,kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkjkkk
6jUv3gDAM1E,Feel bad how
6jUv3gDAM1E,@Tracey Mixon your response is why we feel bad 😂
6jUv3gDAM1E,@Tracey Mixon woah woah woah no need to be mad <br><br><br>I am also autism but i am fine with it because i use it as a excuse
y8qc8Aa3weE,Completely agree.
y8qc8Aa3weE,What&#39;s called that Book? Plz
y8qc8Aa3weE,Same here. It really slapped my face will definitely be more with my kids
y8qc8Aa3weE,Also autism delays language and it occurs at the same rate across the socio-economic scale.
y8qc8Aa3weE,"Agree. I know professionals that are more interested in chasing more money than their child. Although to the outside world, they have the perfect little family. I feel sorry for the child."
y8qc8Aa3weE,@Valquiria Pereira a Little too much.
y8qc8Aa3weE,The nanny probably interacted well with the children
y8qc8Aa3weE,This point came to my mind and I wondered
y8qc8Aa3weE,"Altough the syntax of a lecture can indeed shape social conventions and beliefs the meaingfulness of retroactivly correcting the aforementioned can and should be discussed. The main risk in this bevavior one has to consider is alienating the audience unsure of either side. The propability of someone still unsure whether the role of the father is truly equal changing his/her mind will not be affected to your side by reading your comment (given the best case). I recon it might actually have the opposite effect which is especially a pity because you try to advocate for a very important issue. So going into the future I only ask of you to try to building your reasoning more soloution oriented. Try to convince the people that don&#39;t agree with your position, not those that already do ;) Best regards and excuse me if I made a few mistakes in my syntax as well, english is not my native language :)"
y8qc8Aa3weE,Father&#39;s role is equal
y8qc8Aa3weE,7-8 years old.
y8qc8Aa3weE,I am an Audiologist. I agree👍
y8qc8Aa3weE,Wow🌷🌷⚘⚘
y8qc8Aa3weE,JAMES GRIFFIN
y8qc8Aa3weE,University really is messing up a lot of good people.
y8qc8Aa3weE,"Start talking, it is NOT too late! Two is very young. Children pick up language easily until at least 6. You have time, so begin now. You will both be happier for a new project to work on together."
y8qc8Aa3weE,"Silly, you were born smart. Not everyone is."
y8qc8Aa3weE,"You go, girl! Keep up the love and good work!"
y8qc8Aa3weE,Hahaha nope! But u could use this in ur studies and reference them
y8qc8Aa3weE,"This misses an important factor - many parents living in poverty are working full time or working two jobs. They are home long enough to sleep, when their babies are also sleeping. If they take time off to spend quality time with their kids, they lose wages, sometimes enough to lose food on the table or not be able to pay the electric bill. When you live pay check to pay check, losing wages is going to cost more than just a few hours of time off. It could mean the difference between buying a can of baby formula that will feed your child for a few more days or your child can starve for those few days. Tough choices - starving babies or a day off work?  And in case you haven&#39;t seen it lately, formula is now over $30 a can. For a person making minimum wage, that is a full half a day or more of wages."
y8qc8Aa3weE,Tell us more about your experience please...Thanks a lot for sharing. I am thinking about homeschooling my son.
y8qc8Aa3weE,S
y8qc8Aa3weE,"You&#39;re an exception, what she&#39;s saying is interaction with a baby is crucial more words the better."
y8qc8Aa3weE,How did you obtain a doctorate degree without an understanding of statistics?
y8qc8Aa3weE,"Don&#39;t forget that it was &quot;only&quot; 42 families, so the accuracy of the experiment is somewhat lacking imo. And ofc there are exceptions :)"
y8qc8Aa3weE,That is how it is at that age. My kids rarely let me read to them ever but they loved hearing my childhood fables from my native country and I talked to them plant as kids. Both graduated from prestigious universities with highest honors.
y8qc8Aa3weE,"I think poverty plays a role when the parent becomes more preoccupied with other things than being with their child. When you don&#39;t have money, you need to work more meaning most of the time you are away. In addition to that, I have seen that most of these families depend on screentime to keep their children entertained when it is the opposite of what these kids need to develop. Interaction with the child seems less, and basically the values of each family can vary depending on the financial stability of each family. It&#39;s sad but true that most of the time, the least privileged families are the ones who invest more in buying play stations, subscriptions for television, give their children access to tablets and phones.....hence this technology discouraging interaction. On the other hand, you might find that richer families invest more on travel and holidays creating more interaction time with the kids, encourage more outdoor activities,.....I don&#39;t know, but I think I quite get the correlation."
y8qc8Aa3weE,FruitCakeReaper  children are not bricks.
y8qc8Aa3weE,Did you have the same emphasis on music?
y8qc8Aa3weE,@FruitCakeReaper g
y8qc8Aa3weE,✔️✔️✔️✔️✔️✔️✔️✔️✔️✔️✔️🔥🔥✔️
y8qc8Aa3weE,👍👍👍🔥👍🔥👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
y8qc8Aa3weE,I think it is often how they were raised.  That&#39;s why parent education is so important.  It&#39;s also important to work toward removing racial and cultural biases.
y8qc8Aa3weE,You&#39;re right about the laziness of the parent thing
y8qc8Aa3weE,"I agree.  The hospital or pediatrician there should give this kind of info to the new parents.  Babies don&#39;t come with instructions, but a pamphlet about the importance of talking to your baby would be helpful to everyone.  Good luck with your baby&#39;s progress!"
y8qc8Aa3weE,lol
y8qc8Aa3weE,"action instead of speaking of course is another language, children watching their caregivers cooking, cleaning, decorating, mowing, raking, playing musical instruments, basketball/sports, etc. is quality/impressionable tagging/imprinting on a child&#39;s memory in my view these tasks etc. are more important than empty words."
y8qc8Aa3weE,"It would have made more sense if they kept to the measurement of interactions with children. Not sure why &#39;class&#39; was brought into it. Some people with money might spend all their time trying to make more, and the children are with nannies. On the other hand, a family with less money could also spend alot of interactive time with their child."
y8qc8Aa3weE,Imagine there was a certain group in the population that had 3 out of 4 children out of wedlock. A single parent cannot spend the same time with their children as non-divorced couples that raise their children together. <br><br>We can&#39;t ignore the elephant in the room
y8qc8Aa3weE,Welfare families should refrain from giving birth to more than 1 kids. In that way they can utilise the resources they have in proper way.
y8qc8Aa3weE,"Nothing to do with money, everything to do with education. You can give a million dollars to an uneducated person and they&#39;ll be broke in a month."
y8qc8Aa3weE,"There also might be a correlation between professional parents/ planned familys vs welfare parents/ unplanned family. So maybe professionals have spent time reflecting on the choices and what their goals as parents vs welfare parents just trying to get through? <br>I donno, just a thought and also obviously a large generalization."
y8qc8Aa3weE,"I am a Montessori trained guide 0-3 and all I can say is AMEN to everything you just said, I am also a huge promoter  to introduce a sign language to babies and toddlers, just to give them another tool to express themselves, when they do understand the language, but cannot speak yet"
y8qc8Aa3weE,What exactly is it that you don’t agree with?
y8qc8Aa3weE,Maybe do an IQ test. Maybe thats just low. How do u know how much was spoken to you before 3 yrs old?
y8qc8Aa3weE,Is his speech delayed? It’s a common problem with multicultural families
y8qc8Aa3weE,I was planning to speak to my child 4 languages. I ruled out one before he&#39;s one year old and continue to speak 3 languages. I am still thinking about speaking that language back.
y8qc8Aa3weE,"@M Didavi we speak Russian, English and German. Children picked it up very easily. While Russian and English is the mother tongue English is taught in school in Germany."
y8qc8Aa3weE,"@Rayzen_ONI Language learning works best when each person speaking a different language, speaks that language exclusively.  As long as the child is interacting and the conversation is relevant to the child, he or she will learn."
y8qc8Aa3weE,"@andrade anita, how did you manage to do that? Was there a language per day?"
y8qc8Aa3weE,"My FIL is a great blessing to my now 22 months twins that way. My son has been listening to his stories since he was three months! My daughter loves to sit with him and talk.<br><br>In addition, our neighbours spend time regularly just interacting with them.<br><br>Extended family is a great blessing for children&#39;s development."
y8qc8Aa3weE,"And the more (healthy) family members the better!<br><br><br>I actually just learned the other day that when parents move back with their families (grandparents, aunts/uncles, etc) with their troubled kid, behavioral problems go down. I think family&#39;s really important not just for language development, but for everything really!"
y8qc8Aa3weE,"doula2010 Yea I noticed that too. I think every family member is important especially dad (or the partner)!  Mom and baby have a special bond, but any caregiver can help support language development"
y8qc8Aa3weE,"Irina Sp just up your focus on reading singing word games second language, make efforts to talk all the time explain and such . If you are aware of your own ‘need to improve “ areas, just work on them."
y8qc8Aa3weE,"I hated the classism side of this. I am low income, I spent time with my son<br>While he was in the womb playing classical music, talking to him and massaging my tummy lots like he was already born. We have had a tough time emotionally and financially, he has autism and other things. He’s amazing and his vocabulary is outstanding for his age. Lower income families have less opportunities for learning, everything costs extra. How can they reach full potential without access to the same opportunities, such as tutors, extra curricular activities, stage schools, learning programmes. All cost money that professional busy parents drop their kids off to."
y8qc8Aa3weE,👏👏👏👏🙌
y8qc8Aa3weE,This sounds like a whole system overhaul and it needs money to do it.
y8qc8Aa3weE,"This is so spot on, thank you for sharing this."
y8qc8Aa3weE,@Crystal Burnham Yes because doctors and lawyers arent tired either after a 14 hour day but you at Walmart sitting at a register are EXHAUSTED loooool
y8qc8Aa3weE,"@Buggy Sure thing, Skippy."
y8qc8Aa3weE,@megamillionfreak It is not. She is correct.
y8qc8Aa3weE,Vanessa Seck You’re asking for Negative Proof?? 😂😂😂
y8qc8Aa3weE,@megamillionfreak Where is the evidence to the contrary?
y8qc8Aa3weE,Urška Yeah. She simply decided herself it’s not “race related.”
y8qc8Aa3weE,Definitely!!!
y8qc8Aa3weE,But reading at early age to kids was known even prior to the study
y8qc8Aa3weE,"@Lasini Latu it’s not a first world problem if language can solve poverty, it should be a priority if you have morals."
y8qc8Aa3weE,"Although I love this video and her wise lesson, I too thought this is more of first world problems as the poverty have something more serious to engage in."
y8qc8Aa3weE,Let her difine poor.  Do rich pple even have time to spend with their kids.  Scientist always think they know all. Every spirit is different.
y8qc8Aa3weE,Einstein is the one and only. Not many are like him.
y8qc8Aa3weE,"Absolutely Andrea, and it&#39;s this very empty rhetoric that has states building prisons based on 3rd grade testing scores. smh"
y8qc8Aa3weE,Mrs Newbhero In my state we have different programs in our health department some of wich any family can use regardless of income standards. I get to see a nurse throughout my pregnancy and after as well as getting home visits. They allow wic to focus on nutritional education and and fill in the gap with development education.
y8qc8Aa3weE,That&#39;s awesome lol!
y8qc8Aa3weE,Donna Worthy 100% agreed. But milestones can be flexible and not a casting stone for life.
y8qc8Aa3weE,almaz78 that&#39;s so true
y8qc8Aa3weE,almaz78 100% agree with you. Child care workers are the ones caring for children for long days. Although most child care workers are well versed on how to encourage child development it is a very underpaid undervalued job. Many child care workers need professional development big time!
y8qc8Aa3weE,Didn&#39;t read at the acceptable grade level?
y8qc8Aa3weE,Brandy Miller I agree.
y8qc8Aa3weE,raheelabbas84 and you need 👊 to edit your mind .
y8qc8Aa3weE,I wondered how your daughter is doing 4 yrs later. Did you choose intervention like early intervention or anything else or did it work out in the end? I hope you are all doing well.
y8qc8Aa3weE,"This is something to bring to the attention of your pediatrician if she&#39;s truly not speaking several words. It also might seem like she&#39;s not talking a whole lot, but she might use other forms of communication (gestures, body language, etc.) The key is to encourage the use of WORDS to communicate. You would need a referral to a speech/language pathologist for recommendations for your child specifically."
y8qc8Aa3weE,Kerri Willis how many words a child has at 18 months is no casting stone! It&#39;s more about how they use the sounds they have and how they communicate. If you need a boost please watch my video about milestones and if you have any questions please reach out to me. I am a child development consultant wanting to help parents and caregivers out there 💖
y8qc8Aa3weE,"Kerri Willis maybe she doesn&#39;t talk because you know what she needs and have a higher non verbal congruence with her. my first daughter had a speech delay they called it.. I have five kids and know they all develop at their own pace and my son u cant shut him up..he became the president of his second grade class because he wanted his favorite food rice on the school menu , my third child was first in her kindergarten class and learned to speak Spanish as well by 4 from a day care that was highly speaking Spanish, as for my first who had the delay when she was placed in an early learning classroom there were different stimuli that encouraged learning words through labeling everything that could be labeled ie the door had a tag label door etc..you can do this at home. She is actually more of a reader then a speaker to this day. Then I was instructed to say everything I was doing just for the sake of conversation but we had such a bond i always knew what she wanted and didn&#39;t speak much to her but it didn&#39;t damage her at all she has such profound insight when she did speak she would say things like after seeing me cry ..&quot; After ever storm there&#39;s supposed to be a rainbow&quot; at four years old...not fully aware of the problems between her dad and I yet aware of how to effectively communicate her love. new moms worry a lot after hearing things like this and its great to think just words can help yet its more true imo to know in what environment your child thrives in and many environments are available no matter what the income level is as long as the bond is established so they feel secure in their unique self expression. I only intend to send love towards you since I felt similar to your comment at one point."
y8qc8Aa3weE,If you think the government is in charge of your health and your income...you&#39;ve got a big problem! Take your power back. Only YOU are in charge of YOU.
y8qc8Aa3weE,"Whydo Yuouwanttoknow <br>Unfortunately the government is made up of people who elected by us and from us, we are the government"
y8qc8Aa3weE,Seems you might have missed the point/focus of the video.
y8qc8Aa3weE,Whydo Yuouwanttoknow I have some ethical issues with GMO(Corporations owning seed and their unethical practices) but it&#39;s not a health concern. Honesty it&#39;s safer for the population than pesticides.
y8qc8Aa3weE,check your facts. That&#39;s so absolutely not true
y8qc8Aa3weE,You aren’t giving any facts to back up what you are saying!
y8qc8Aa3weE,Ann Benson Also do you even know what an auto immune diseases is or how they work or are you just digging for something because you know your wrong and still want to stand for your false view.
y8qc8Aa3weE,Irina Godunko This comment is gibberish. Take a biology class.
y8qc8Aa3weE,"It should be embarrassing now days to be so ignorant. There is a science which is NEVER settle and scientism. So call &quot;scientists&quot; who promotes inoculation have no clue how immune system operates. All their theories just it - theories.  Ever read about horizontal transfer of genetic traits in between species across kingdom by MicroRNA or &quot;dark matter&quot; of the genome (98.5% of the genome that does not code for protein)? Yea, I didn&#39;t think so....."
y8qc8Aa3weE,Eimear Kennedy Honestly I have found peer interaction increased my daughter&#39;s language. My sitter started watching a two year old when my daughter turns 10 months now at 13 she speaks around 15 words now and is improving every day.
y8qc8Aa3weE,Well said
y8qc8Aa3weE,FACTS THANK YOU.
y8qc8Aa3weE,"Marianna Gltd yes, it’s good to remember that quality of life does not correspond to more money spent- especially when it comes to children.  It’s great that you are aware that screen time doesn’t help young children. The funny thing is, as a care giver for toddlers, during the quarantine, we have been spending time with our class twice a week on zoom. I don’t like exposing the children to screens, but we can’t see them in person now, so I make sure I interact with each child several times during the zoom “lesson’."
y8qc8Aa3weE,"You are so right I couldn&#39;t agree more with you. If you notice, even the speaker says at some point that the research showed that the child&#39;s development doesn&#39;t have to do with the money. So, later she kind of reverses what she said at first point. Maybe more research has to be done? Any way, speech is good generally and the point she wants to make with her speech, which is talk to your child, is very important. I think it has to do more with the education of the parents rather than the economic status. In Greece where I live for instance, the majority of the families have TV plus they can afford tablets that they give to their children to keep them quiet. I have a TV and tablet as well, but I never have the TV on when child is in the room or give her my phone or tablet. I ain&#39;t super rich or sth, but the education I have received and the people I grew up with made me want to live my life in a much more simple way, which leads to a much better quality in my life:)"
y8qc8Aa3weE,"@Sandra L Of course, the problem is when people need both wage earners in order to provide necessities AND when government policy requires that parents work in order to get welfare benefits."
y8qc8Aa3weE,Diana Mcmullen Sounds simple but people don&#39;t know if they aren&#39;t told by professions or shown by older family members.
y8qc8Aa3weE,"Well, I wonder how you imagined your child should learn the words if you&#39;re not saying them? Perhaps you can offer them your feedback so they can better serve other families."
y8qc8Aa3weE,"lslash brun it&#39;s never too late to start. Developmental milestones can be flexible and positively increasing interaction, play and responsiveness will improve your child&#39;s development."
y8qc8Aa3weE,"You are being too hard on yourself. Positive affirmation is important for a child. I benefited from i wasn’t the most gifted child, went from being the worst to the best student in my class now I’m a medical doctor. Don’t lose hope. 🙂"
y8qc8Aa3weE,lslash brun it&#39;s not too late! As a child care professional I have worked with children that have delays and seen amazing improvements in short months. Once you make up your mind your going to change the way you interact with your child you can make amazing things happen
y8qc8Aa3weE,"Some ideas would be board/card games, flash cards, story telling at library, music, art, and apps"
y8qc8Aa3weE,Just wanted to let you know you are doing an amazing job!
y8qc8Aa3weE,"thank u for that. he turned 5 yesterday. I had been doing so all along but, I was never deliberate. i read him books before bedtime &amp; at naptime but since I&#39;ve seen this video I&#39;ve been actually making &quot;special playtime&quot; just for creative play &amp;interactive learning &amp;I&#39;ve found that he knows tons more than I thought, so thank u tremendously for your encouragement. I grew up in a culture that never put emphasis on any of this &amp;I am truly grateful to have come across this information &amp;I appreciate your encouragement. this gives me restored hope"
y8qc8Aa3weE,"We will have to disagree on that. I once did some research on this and it is clear that men will act and react differently than a woman. For instance, a male will carry a child differently, a man will play with a child differently, and respond differently to a child differently in many ways. I have personally seen this over and over."
y8qc8Aa3weE,"Lyn Anderson That is a product of socialisation, not inate capability."
y8qc8Aa3weE,"My son may be a great father and stay at home dad, but he does not have the intuition a good mother has for her children. And I can see the difference in his children!"
y8qc8Aa3weE,Rosario Reyes I understand what you mean. Children have the ability to learn multiple languages at the same time. My son started saying &quot;eso&quot; at the same time he started saying &quot;that&quot;
y8qc8Aa3weE,Not getting the point at all!
y8qc8Aa3weE,The point was not that you are doomed. Chances of success are simply reduced. She is educating people.
y8qc8Aa3weE,Yes! We just have to find our own way and know it&#39;s not &quot;wrong&quot;
y8qc8Aa3weE,"@K P i think talking to medical experts in the field would be better than asking random people on YouTube. But here is my non expert advice: there is always development and change in a person past any age. Find what limits them, work with experts and see the way forward there. Above all else enjoy what you have already, don&#39;t overstress and feel like you&#39;re missing out."
y8qc8Aa3weE,@Andrea W she does not at all seem to be saying that autism is caused by parents not talking enough to their kids. she seems to be speaking about the average child.
y8qc8Aa3weE,@Karina Tampoe}
y8qc8Aa3weE,"Poor people are too worry about how to bring food to the table so how they can talk more with their kids, it’s totally understandable"
y8qc8Aa3weE,"according to my personal experience, children in  lower socio economy  to be harder focused well on their study coz they have to share the same burden with their&#39;s single parent. my sad childhood is a nightmare, but it&#39;s sending me eager study in university with my education bachelor be a teacher for early child student improve their capable with love, it helps me throw away my nightmare"
y8qc8Aa3weE,"I think she has a good projection here, but you are right, she is missing the explanation of this social situation.  I also think their solution is missing a couple of contextual processes.  Mothers who are in this &quot;poverty&quot; group may fall into a lot of other roles making it more difficult to fulfill the task of talking to their children as much as the &quot;professional group.&quot;  For instance, single parent families with one income are more likely to be in a poverty group, and also have half of the adults talking to children.  Furthermore, working labor intensive jobs, odd hours, more hours, and the stress of making ends meet take away opportunities to do so.  You can&#39;t address the cycle and say, &quot;hey look, you can fix it, all you have to do is A,B, and C like these other people. Let me teach you!&quot; Without considering the barriers to them actually implementing AB&amp;C."
y8qc8Aa3weE,Becker&#39;s School Supplies
y8qc8Aa3weE,@Carol G well it kind of does. Just like impoverished families often live in food deserts they often lack access to those books because of lack of libraries and school resources. America is home of the unequal and Americans apparently like it that way...
y8qc8Aa3weE,"@brad bustamante I have relative, they are on the rich side, top of the middle working class, they average 25-30hrs working a week at work. you are thinking of ppls who work extra hard to make &quot;high income&quot;"
y8qc8Aa3weE,"@g2gCtheI&#39;m not sure about your assumptions. Where are you getting the idea that high income workers work less hours? On another note, the families were observed for one hour per month for three years. The calculations were made using the same amount of interaction time."
y8qc8Aa3weE,Zander Star I
y8qc8Aa3weE,"Income is a by product of human behavior, if your parents are used to making a 100,000 figure salary then the child will strive to meet their only example of what an income should be. However your emotional intelligence plays a much more significant role in actually achieving the goals set by your parents. So really it&#39;s a 2 step system, first you have to want it, then you have to have the tools to obtain it."
y8qc8Aa3weE,"+thetruth, you seem to be making observations about a couple of very separate developmental concepts. First of all, language really IS this important and the more you talk to your baby/toddler, the better. Individual differences between two children (the twins you reference) can be because of a difference in temperament (introverted/extroverted). Sometimes it&#39;s a power struggle--some babies love the &quot;parroting&quot; stage, where they repeat back everything you say, others make sure they never repeat words back &quot;just because you want them to&quot;. Just because a young child doesn&#39;t SAY a word doesn&#39;t mean they don&#39;t KNOW it. Secondly, interfering with learning/playtime in young children excessively DOES limit their ability to explore/learn by themselves. Children learn best with minimal interventions, but still mindful presence of caretakers. This means caretakers are present (not staring at their iphones), engaged in what is happening...but they don&#39;t grab toys out of children&#39;s hands, they don&#39;t excessively redirect activities (&quot;come play with this now instead&quot;), and they don&#39;t SHOW children HOW to play with a toy. So like I said, you are talking about a variety of developmental opportunities and lumping it all into one facet. There is no such thing as being &quot;too attentive&quot; if the definition of attentive means PRESENT. There is such a thing as excessive praise, excessive interruptions and redirections...and that does inhibit natural learning processes."
y8qc8Aa3weE,"and dont forget that highly paid professionals have nannies taking care of their babies. not themselves, so explain that one"
y8qc8Aa3weE,the non professional can&#39;t identify what professional means hmmmm....
y8qc8Aa3weE,"Ok, but we are still missing how the study defined &quot;professional&quot;.  We can all interpret it any way we want, but this is a research study.  They had to have clear guidelines for their sample, and we don&#39;t know what those guidelines were for who they called &quot;professional&quot;.  Also, &quot;Poor families do not have the intellectual capacity to discuss more than...&quot; is such a ridiculous statement!  Our teachers in American make 30,000 a year.  If they have 4 children they are poor.  I think you are mixing up pieces of intelligence, education, and income and these factors are not synonymous.  We should not be looking at how the lower performing sample can learn from the higher performing sample without addressing the systemic barriers to implementing those changes.  It&#39;s like giving someone who speaks Spanish a book on taxes written in English, because that is what is helping the English speaking people to do taxes."
y8qc8Aa3weE,"I think professional means that you are capable and educated to have a child. Poor families do not have the intellectual capacity to discuss more than the basic needs of the family - food , cold, cloth etc. When you know words, languages, read, write, music etc you are more likely to have more words and more detailed interaction with a child However...smart people don;t always take care of their children how they should teach them and educate them. Bottom line is that if you do not interact more than 1000% with that forming brain it will lead to nothing. I see 5 yr children from good families with a very light baggage of information and more toys than words etc. good video. anything that makes us think and take a stand and improve it&#39;s good"
y8qc8Aa3weE,Completely agree.
y8qc8Aa3weE,What&#39;s called that Book? Plz
y8qc8Aa3weE,Same here. It really slapped my face will definitely be more with my kids
y8qc8Aa3weE,Also autism delays language and it occurs at the same rate across the socio-economic scale.
y8qc8Aa3weE,"Agree. I know professionals that are more interested in chasing more money than their child. Although to the outside world, they have the perfect little family. I feel sorry for the child."
y8qc8Aa3weE,@Valquiria Pereira a Little too much.
y8qc8Aa3weE,The nanny probably interacted well with the children
y8qc8Aa3weE,This point came to my mind and I wondered
y8qc8Aa3weE,"Altough the syntax of a lecture can indeed shape social conventions and beliefs the meaingfulness of retroactivly correcting the aforementioned can and should be discussed. The main risk in this bevavior one has to consider is alienating the audience unsure of either side. The propability of someone still unsure whether the role of the father is truly equal changing his/her mind will not be affected to your side by reading your comment (given the best case). I recon it might actually have the opposite effect which is especially a pity because you try to advocate for a very important issue. So going into the future I only ask of you to try to building your reasoning more soloution oriented. Try to convince the people that don&#39;t agree with your position, not those that already do ;) Best regards and excuse me if I made a few mistakes in my syntax as well, english is not my native language :)"
y8qc8Aa3weE,Father&#39;s role is equal
y8qc8Aa3weE,7-8 years old.
y8qc8Aa3weE,I am an Audiologist. I agree👍
y8qc8Aa3weE,Wow🌷🌷⚘⚘
y8qc8Aa3weE,JAMES GRIFFIN
y8qc8Aa3weE,University really is messing up a lot of good people.
y8qc8Aa3weE,"Start talking, it is NOT too late! Two is very young. Children pick up language easily until at least 6. You have time, so begin now. You will both be happier for a new project to work on together."
y8qc8Aa3weE,"Silly, you were born smart. Not everyone is."
y8qc8Aa3weE,"You go, girl! Keep up the love and good work!"
y8qc8Aa3weE,Hahaha nope! But u could use this in ur studies and reference them
y8qc8Aa3weE,"This misses an important factor - many parents living in poverty are working full time or working two jobs. They are home long enough to sleep, when their babies are also sleeping. If they take time off to spend quality time with their kids, they lose wages, sometimes enough to lose food on the table or not be able to pay the electric bill. When you live pay check to pay check, losing wages is going to cost more than just a few hours of time off. It could mean the difference between buying a can of baby formula that will feed your child for a few more days or your child can starve for those few days. Tough choices - starving babies or a day off work?  And in case you haven&#39;t seen it lately, formula is now over $30 a can. For a person making minimum wage, that is a full half a day or more of wages."
y8qc8Aa3weE,Tell us more about your experience please...Thanks a lot for sharing. I am thinking about homeschooling my son.
y8qc8Aa3weE,S
y8qc8Aa3weE,"You&#39;re an exception, what she&#39;s saying is interaction with a baby is crucial more words the better."
y8qc8Aa3weE,How did you obtain a doctorate degree without an understanding of statistics?
y8qc8Aa3weE,"Don&#39;t forget that it was &quot;only&quot; 42 families, so the accuracy of the experiment is somewhat lacking imo. And ofc there are exceptions :)"
y8qc8Aa3weE,That is how it is at that age. My kids rarely let me read to them ever but they loved hearing my childhood fables from my native country and I talked to them plant as kids. Both graduated from prestigious universities with highest honors.
y8qc8Aa3weE,"I think poverty plays a role when the parent becomes more preoccupied with other things than being with their child. When you don&#39;t have money, you need to work more meaning most of the time you are away. In addition to that, I have seen that most of these families depend on screentime to keep their children entertained when it is the opposite of what these kids need to develop. Interaction with the child seems less, and basically the values of each family can vary depending on the financial stability of each family. It&#39;s sad but true that most of the time, the least privileged families are the ones who invest more in buying play stations, subscriptions for television, give their children access to tablets and phones.....hence this technology discouraging interaction. On the other hand, you might find that richer families invest more on travel and holidays creating more interaction time with the kids, encourage more outdoor activities,.....I don&#39;t know, but I think I quite get the correlation."
y8qc8Aa3weE,FruitCakeReaper  children are not bricks.
y8qc8Aa3weE,Did you have the same emphasis on music?

y8qc8Aa3weE,✔️✔️✔️✔️✔️✔️✔️✔️✔️✔️✔️🔥🔥✔️
y8qc8Aa3weE,👍👍👍🔥👍🔥👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
y8qc8Aa3weE,I think it is often how they were raised.  That&#39;s why parent education is so important.  It&#39;s also important to work toward removing racial and cultural biases.
y8qc8Aa3weE,You&#39;re right about the laziness of the parent thing
y8qc8Aa3weE,"I agree.  The hospital or pediatrician there should give this kind of info to the new parents.  Babies don&#39;t come with instructions, but a pamphlet about the importance of talking to your baby would be helpful to everyone.  Good luck with your baby&#39;s progress!"
y8qc8Aa3weE,lol
y8qc8Aa3weE,"action instead of speaking of course is another language, children watching their caregivers cooking, cleaning, decorating, mowing, raking, playing musical instruments, basketball/sports, etc. is quality/impressionable tagging/imprinting on a child&#39;s memory in my view these tasks etc. are more important than empty words."
y8qc8Aa3weE,"It would have made more sense if they kept to the measurement of interactions with children. Not sure why &#39;class&#39; was brought into it. Some people with money might spend all their time trying to make more, and the children are with nannies. On the other hand, a family with less money could also spend alot of interactive time with their child."
y8qc8Aa3weE,Imagine there was a certain group in the population that had 3 out of 4 children out of wedlock. A single parent cannot spend the same time with their children as non-divorced couples that raise their children together. <br><br>We can&#39;t ignore the elephant in the room
y8qc8Aa3weE,Welfare families should refrain from giving birth to more than 1 kids. In that way they can utilise the resources they have in proper way.
y8qc8Aa3weE,"Nothing to do with money, everything to do with education. You can give a million dollars to an uneducated person and they&#39;ll be broke in a month."
y8qc8Aa3weE,"There also might be a correlation between professional parents/ planned familys vs welfare parents/ unplanned family. So maybe professionals have spent time reflecting on the choices and what their goals as parents vs welfare parents just trying to get through? <br>I donno, just a thought and also obviously a large generalization."
y8qc8Aa3weE,"I am a Montessori trained guide 0-3 and all I can say is AMEN to everything you just said, I am also a huge promoter  to introduce a sign language to babies and toddlers, just to give them another tool to express themselves, when they do understand the language, but cannot speak yet"
y8qc8Aa3weE,What exactly is it that you don’t agree with?
y8qc8Aa3weE,Maybe do an IQ test. Maybe thats just low. How do u know how much was spoken to you before 3 yrs old?
y8qc8Aa3weE,Is his speech delayed? It’s a common problem with multicultural families
y8qc8Aa3weE,I was planning to speak to my child 4 languages. I ruled out one before he&#39;s one year old and continue to speak 3 languages. I am still thinking about speaking that language back.
y8qc8Aa3weE,"@M Didavi we speak Russian, English and German. Children picked it up very easily. While Russian and English is the mother tongue English is taught in school in Germany."
y8qc8Aa3weE,"@Rayzen_ONI Language learning works best when each person speaking a different language, speaks that language exclusively.  As long as the child is interacting and the conversation is relevant to the child, he or she will learn."
y8qc8Aa3weE,"@andrade anita, how did you manage to do that? Was there a language per day?"
y8qc8Aa3weE,"My FIL is a great blessing to my now 22 months twins that way. My son has been listening to his stories since he was three months! My daughter loves to sit with him and talk.<br><br>In addition, our neighbours spend time regularly just interacting with them.<br><br>Extended family is a great blessing for children&#39;s development."
y8qc8Aa3weE,"And the more (healthy) family members the better!<br><br><br>I actually just learned the other day that when parents move back with their families (grandparents, aunts/uncles, etc) with their troubled kid, behavioral problems go down. I think family&#39;s really important not just for language development, but for everything really!"
y8qc8Aa3weE,"doula2010 Yea I noticed that too. I think every family member is important especially dad (or the partner)!  Mom and baby have a special bond, but any caregiver can help support language development"
y8qc8Aa3weE,"Irina Sp just up your focus on reading singing word games second language, make efforts to talk all the time explain and such . If you are aware of your own ‘need to improve “ areas, just work on them."
y8qc8Aa3weE,"I hated the classism side of this. I am low income, I spent time with my son<br>While he was in the womb playing classical music, talking to him and massaging my tummy lots like he was already born. We have had a tough time emotionally and financially, he has autism and other things. He’s amazing and his vocabulary is outstanding for his age. Lower income families have less opportunities for learning, everything costs extra. How can they reach full potential without access to the same opportunities, such as tutors, extra curricular activities, stage schools, learning programmes. All cost money that professional busy parents drop their kids off to."
y8qc8Aa3weE,👏👏👏👏🙌
y8qc8Aa3weE,This sounds like a whole system overhaul and it needs money to do it.
y8qc8Aa3weE,"This is so spot on, thank you for sharing this."
y8qc8Aa3weE,@Crystal Burnham Yes because doctors and lawyers arent tired either after a 14 hour day but you at Walmart sitting at a register are EXHAUSTED loooool
y8qc8Aa3weE,"@Buggy Sure thing, Skippy."
y8qc8Aa3weE,@megamillionfreak It is not. She is correct.
y8qc8Aa3weE,Vanessa Seck You’re asking for Negative Proof?? 😂😂😂
y8qc8Aa3weE,@megamillionfreak Where is the evidence to the contrary?
y8qc8Aa3weE,Urška Yeah. She simply decided herself it’s not “race related.”
y8qc8Aa3weE,Definitely!!!
y8qc8Aa3weE,But reading at early age to kids was known even prior to the study
y8qc8Aa3weE,"@Lasini Latu it’s not a first world problem if language can solve poverty, it should be a priority if you have morals."
y8qc8Aa3weE,"Although I love this video and her wise lesson, I too thought this is more of first world problems as the poverty have something more serious to engage in."
y8qc8Aa3weE,Let her difine poor.  Do rich pple even have time to spend with their kids.  Scientist always think they know all. Every spirit is different.
y8qc8Aa3weE,Einstein is the one and only. Not many are like him.
y8qc8Aa3weE,"Absolutely Andrea, and it&#39;s this very empty rhetoric that has states building prisons based on 3rd grade testing scores. smh"
y8qc8Aa3weE,Mrs Newbhero In my state we have different programs in our health department some of wich any family can use regardless of income standards. I get to see a nurse throughout my pregnancy and after as well as getting home visits. They allow wic to focus on nutritional education and and fill in the gap with development education.
y8qc8Aa3weE,That&#39;s awesome lol!
y8qc8Aa3weE,Donna Worthy 100% agreed. But milestones can be flexible and not a casting stone for life.
y8qc8Aa3weE,almaz78 that&#39;s so true
y8qc8Aa3weE,almaz78 100% agree with you. Child care workers are the ones caring for children for long days. Although most child care workers are well versed on how to encourage child development it is a very underpaid undervalued job. Many child care workers need professional development big time!
y8qc8Aa3weE,Didn&#39;t read at the acceptable grade level?
y8qc8Aa3weE,Brandy Miller I agree.
y8qc8Aa3weE,raheelabbas84 and you need 👊 to edit your mind .
y8qc8Aa3weE,I wondered how your daughter is doing 4 yrs later. Did you choose intervention like early intervention or anything else or did it work out in the end? I hope you are all doing well.
y8qc8Aa3weE,"This is something to bring to the attention of your pediatrician if she&#39;s truly not speaking several words. It also might seem like she&#39;s not talking a whole lot, but she might use other forms of communication (gestures, body language, etc.) The key is to encourage the use of WORDS to communicate. You would need a referral to a speech/language pathologist for recommendations for your child specifically."
y8qc8Aa3weE,Kerri Willis how many words a child has at 18 months is no casting stone! It&#39;s more about how they use the sounds they have and how they communicate. If you need a boost please watch my video about milestones and if you have any questions please reach out to me. I am a child development consultant wanting to help parents and caregivers out there 💖
y8qc8Aa3weE,"Kerri Willis maybe she doesn&#39;t talk because you know what she needs and have a higher non verbal congruence with her. my first daughter had a speech delay they called it.. I have five kids and know they all develop at their own pace and my son u cant shut him up..he became the president of his second grade class because he wanted his favorite food rice on the school menu , my third child was first in her kindergarten class and learned to speak Spanish as well by 4 from a day care that was highly speaking Spanish, as for my first who had the delay when she was placed in an early learning classroom there were different stimuli that encouraged learning words through labeling everything that could be labeled ie the door had a tag label door etc..you can do this at home. She is actually more of a reader then a speaker to this day. Then I was instructed to say everything I was doing just for the sake of conversation but we had such a bond i always knew what she wanted and didn&#39;t speak much to her but it didn&#39;t damage her at all she has such profound insight when she did speak she would say things like after seeing me cry ..&quot; After ever storm there&#39;s supposed to be a rainbow&quot; at four years old...not fully aware of the problems between her dad and I yet aware of how to effectively communicate her love. new moms worry a lot after hearing things like this and its great to think just words can help yet its more true imo to know in what environment your child thrives in and many environments are available no matter what the income level is as long as the bond is established so they feel secure in their unique self expression. I only intend to send love towards you since I felt similar to your comment at one point."
y8qc8Aa3weE,If you think the government is in charge of your health and your income...you&#39;ve got a big problem! Take your power back. Only YOU are in charge of YOU.
y8qc8Aa3weE,"Whydo Yuouwanttoknow <br>Unfortunately the government is made up of people who elected by us and from us, we are the government"
y8qc8Aa3weE,Seems you might have missed the point/focus of the video.
y8qc8Aa3weE,Whydo Yuouwanttoknow I have some ethical issues with GMO(Corporations owning seed and their unethical practices) but it&#39;s not a health concern. Honesty it&#39;s safer for the population than pesticides.
y8qc8Aa3weE,check your facts. That&#39;s so absolutely not true
y8qc8Aa3weE,You aren’t giving any facts to back up what you are saying!
y8qc8Aa3weE,Ann Benson Also do you even know what an auto immune diseases is or how they work or are you just digging for something because you know your wrong and still want to stand for your false view.
y8qc8Aa3weE,Irina Godunko This comment is gibberish. Take a biology class.
y8qc8Aa3weE,"It should be embarrassing now days to be so ignorant. There is a science which is NEVER settle and scientism. So call &quot;scientists&quot; who promotes inoculation have no clue how immune system operates. All their theories just it - theories.  Ever read about horizontal transfer of genetic traits in between species across kingdom by MicroRNA or &quot;dark matter&quot; of the genome (98.5% of the genome that does not code for protein)? Yea, I didn&#39;t think so....."
y8qc8Aa3weE,Eimear Kennedy Honestly I have found peer interaction increased my daughter&#39;s language. My sitter started watching a two year old when my daughter turns 10 months now at 13 she speaks around 15 words now and is improving every day.
y8qc8Aa3weE,Well said
y8qc8Aa3weE,FACTS THANK YOU.
y8qc8Aa3weE,"Marianna Gltd yes, it’s good to remember that quality of life does not correspond to more money spent- especially when it comes to children.  It’s great that you are aware that screen time doesn’t help young children. The funny thing is, as a care giver for toddlers, during the quarantine, we have been spending time with our class twice a week on zoom. I don’t like exposing the children to screens, but we can’t see them in person now, so I make sure I interact with each child several times during the zoom “lesson’."
y8qc8Aa3weE,"You are so right I couldn&#39;t agree more with you. If you notice, even the speaker says at some point that the research showed that the child&#39;s development doesn&#39;t have to do with the money. So, later she kind of reverses what she said at first point. Maybe more research has to be done? Any way, speech is good generally and the point she wants to make with her speech, which is talk to your child, is very important. I think it has to do more with the education of the parents rather than the economic status. In Greece where I live for instance, the majority of the families have TV plus they can afford tablets that they give to their children to keep them quiet. I have a TV and tablet as well, but I never have the TV on when child is in the room or give her my phone or tablet. I ain&#39;t super rich or sth, but the education I have received and the people I grew up with made me want to live my life in a much more simple way, which leads to a much better quality in my life:)"
y8qc8Aa3weE,"@Sandra L Of course, the problem is when people need both wage earners in order to provide necessities AND when government policy requires that parents work in order to get welfare benefits."
y8qc8Aa3weE,Diana Mcmullen Sounds simple but people don&#39;t know if they aren&#39;t told by professions or shown by older family members.
y8qc8Aa3weE,"Well, I wonder how you imagined your child should learn the words if you&#39;re not saying them? Perhaps you can offer them your feedback so they can better serve other families."
y8qc8Aa3weE,"lslash brun it&#39;s never too late to start. Developmental milestones can be flexible and positively increasing interaction, play and responsiveness will improve your child&#39;s development."
y8qc8Aa3weE,"You are being too hard on yourself. Positive affirmation is important for a child. I benefited from i wasn’t the most gifted child, went from being the worst to the best student in my class now I’m a medical doctor. Don’t lose hope. 🙂"
y8qc8Aa3weE,lslash brun it&#39;s not too late! As a child care professional I have worked with children that have delays and seen amazing improvements in short months. Once you make up your mind your going to change the way you interact with your child you can make amazing things happen
y8qc8Aa3weE,"Some ideas would be board/card games, flash cards, story telling at library, music, art, and apps"
y8qc8Aa3weE,Just wanted to let you know you are doing an amazing job!
y8qc8Aa3weE,"thank u for that. he turned 5 yesterday. I had been doing so all along but, I was never deliberate. i read him books before bedtime &amp; at naptime but since I&#39;ve seen this video I&#39;ve been actually making &quot;special playtime&quot; just for creative play &amp;interactive learning &amp;I&#39;ve found that he knows tons more than I thought, so thank u tremendously for your encouragement. I grew up in a culture that never put emphasis on any of this &amp;I am truly grateful to have come across this information &amp;I appreciate your encouragement. this gives me restored hope"
y8qc8Aa3weE,"We will have to disagree on that. I once did some research on this and it is clear that men will act and react differently than a woman. For instance, a male will carry a child differently, a man will play with a child differently, and respond differently to a child differently in many ways. I have personally seen this over and over."
y8qc8Aa3weE,"Lyn Anderson That is a product of socialisation, not inate capability."

y8qc8Aa3weE,"I think she has a good projection here, but you are right, she is missing the explanation of this social situation.  I also think their solution is missing a couple of contextual processes.  Mothers who are in this &quot;poverty&quot; group may fall into a lot of other roles making it more difficult to fulfill the task of talking to their children as much as the &quot;professional group.&quot;  For instance, single parent families with one income are more likely to be in a poverty group, and also have half of the adults talking to children.  Furthermore, working labor intensive jobs, odd hours, more hours, and the stress of making ends meet take away opportunities to do so.  You can&#39;t address the cycle and say, &quot;hey look, you can fix it, all you have to do is A,B, and C like these other people. Let me teach you!&quot; Without considering the barriers to them actually implementing AB&amp;C."
y8qc8Aa3weE,Becker&#39;s School Supplies
y8qc8Aa3weE,@Carol G well it kind of does. Just like impoverished families often live in food deserts they often lack access to those books because of lack of libraries and school resources. America is home of the unequal and Americans apparently like it that way...
y8qc8Aa3weE,"@brad bustamante I have relative, they are on the rich side, top of the middle working class, they average 25-30hrs working a week at work. you are thinking of ppls who work extra hard to make &quot;high income&quot;"
y8qc8Aa3weE,"@g2gCtheI&#39;m not sure about your assumptions. Where are you getting the idea that high income workers work less hours? On another note, the families were observed for one hour per month for three years. The calculations were made using the same amount of interaction time."
y8qc8Aa3weE,Zander Star I
y8qc8Aa3weE,"Income is a by product of human behavior, if your parents are used to making a 100,000 figure salary then the child will strive to meet their only example of what an income should be. However your emotional intelligence plays a much more significant role in actually achieving the goals set by your parents. So really it&#39;s a 2 step system, first you have to want it, then you have to have the tools to obtain it."
y8qc8Aa3weE,"+thetruth, you seem to be making observations about a couple of very separate developmental concepts. First of all, language really IS this important and the more you talk to your baby/toddler, the better. Individual differences between two children (the twins you reference) can be because of a difference in temperament (introverted/extroverted). Sometimes it&#39;s a power struggle--some babies love the &quot;parroting&quot; stage, where they repeat back everything you say, others make sure they never repeat words back &quot;just because you want them to&quot;. Just because a young child doesn&#39;t SAY a word doesn&#39;t mean they don&#39;t KNOW it. Secondly, interfering with learning/playtime in young children excessively DOES limit their ability to explore/learn by themselves. Children learn best with minimal interventions, but still mindful presence of caretakers. This means caretakers are present (not staring at their iphones), engaged in what is happening...but they don&#39;t grab toys out of children&#39;s hands, they don&#39;t excessively redirect activities (&quot;come play with this now instead&quot;), and they don&#39;t SHOW children HOW to play with a toy. So like I said, you are talking about a variety of developmental opportunities and lumping it all into one facet. There is no such thing as being &quot;too attentive&quot; if the definition of attentive means PRESENT. There is such a thing as excessive praise, excessive interruptions and redirections...and that does inhibit natural learning processes."
y8qc8Aa3weE,"and dont forget that highly paid professionals have nannies taking care of their babies. not themselves, so explain that one"
y8qc8Aa3weE,the non professional can&#39;t identify what professional means hmmmm....
y8qc8Aa3weE,"Ok, but we are still missing how the study defined &quot;professional&quot;.  We can all interpret it any way we want, but this is a research study.  They had to have clear guidelines for their sample, and we don&#39;t know what those guidelines were for who they called &quot;professional&quot;.  Also, &quot;Poor families do not have the intellectual capacity to discuss more than...&quot; is such a ridiculous statement!  Our teachers in American make 30,000 a year.  If they have 4 children they are poor.  I think you are mixing up pieces of intelligence, education, and income and these factors are not synonymous.  We should not be looking at how the lower performing sample can learn from the higher performing sample without addressing the systemic barriers to implementing those changes.  It&#39;s like giving someone who speaks Spanish a book on taxes written in English, because that is what is helping the English speaking people to do taxes."
y8qc8Aa3weE,"I think professional means that you are capable and educated to have a child. Poor families do not have the intellectual capacity to discuss more than the basic needs of the family - food , cold, cloth etc. When you know words, languages, read, write, music etc you are more likely to have more words and more detailed interaction with a child However...smart people don;t always take care of their children how they should teach them and educate them. Bottom line is that if you do not interact more than 1000% with that forming brain it will lead to nothing. I see 5 yr children from good families with a very light baggage of information and more toys than words etc. good video. anything that makes us think and take a stand and improve it&#39;s good"

DZXjJVrm1Jw,"@TezlaTower 23 thank you. Not trying to be patronizing and back out of debate like aurora, but that you really made sense. It is true. And now and again I do reflect on my own offspring or even myself. How much of a need to understand ourselves and be aware of others that may not detect for ANY issues. I feel for people who don&#39;t have self awareness YET. I think it would be neat to stop my medicine but unless it was monitored and it was proven to be better, I go with what I&#39;m used to. I have fast brain waves."
DZXjJVrm1Jw,"@Miss K sigh... that&#39;s NOT why more people have been diagnosed. It&#39;s because in the 1970&#39;s and 80&#39;s autism was FAR less known about. Most people didn&#39;t even know what it was and thought it only made children act incredibly hyper or need lots of help. None realised it also makes you smart, or gives you a photographic memory, or gives you a strong love of something. The reason the number of DIAGNOSES have risen is because new autistic people are being DISCOVERED, not created. It&#39;s the same reason that we didn&#39;t know people could hurt others and physically not know what they were doing was even wrong until the 1800&#39;s."
DZXjJVrm1Jw,"@TezlaTower 23 The number of children diagnosed with autism or related disorders has grown at what many call an alarming rate. In the 1970s and 1980s, about one out of every 2,000 children had autism.<br><br>Today, the CDC estimates that one in 150 8-year-olds in the U.S. has an autism spectrum disorder, or ASD.  (that was read from <a href=""https://www.webmd.com/brain/autism/features/autism-rise)"">https://www.webmd.com/brain/autism/features/autism-rise)</a><br><br>I, personally was curious BECAUSE of what some parents wonder as well. Maybe it&#39;s just the time we are living in and well I believe in hoping for the better TIME to be so there is no more hoping for even myself who has different challenges and with dr. and medicine I look at mental health condition of mine as needing crutches. So,  it seems until the end of this TIME frame I will be bound to this endeavor. Whatever keeps my boat sailing until that real hope (Our Father&#39;s &quot;... kingdom to come...&quot;) is no more a hope but as a &quot;turning of the page in mankind&#39;s history with his intelligent designer. It will be all good then for multitudes in that TIME."

DZXjJVrm1Jw,@T han 😳?
DZXjJVrm1Jw,"unsure also help vomit problem but... (Simple test) Unable to maintain look backward posture for a while because it get unbearable headache quickily (try left and right) (the more severe of dislocate, the more painful and faster) ( neck swing is not smooth), also got slight hunchback (don&#39;t remember whether it is slowly worsening), you may just got dislocation of the neck bone or spine but in different severity (if there is no pain, I guessed I&#39;m wrong)......MRI can observe crooked bones from a specific angle... my dislocation (probably multi-joint spin in place toward right, I don’t know how others was)(may also happen during doctor delivers you/baby? say by a website) happen in absence of sound and pain, neck in tension and twisted hardly (panic incident) (just felt strange all over the body at that moment) and neglect for more than 15 years, but it was only few years after the dislocation happen that the neck was begin uncomfortable. Did not doubt it too much, until a lucky small repair..... It pull your throat, brain and blood vessels, causing symptoms/troubles such as thinking speed and ability, which may be affected by mild brain pain/tightness and ischemia/tireness due to a wide range, continuous and possibly unnoticed brain pain. sleepiness, uneasy, easy annoy or angry, is because the blood vessels of the brain &amp; neck have been disrupted by dislocated bones pulling. blood pressure of the brain is easily increasing temporarily with adding muscle reaction of nervous or annoy emotion, thus moderate or severe headache &amp; begin auto outrage mode (reaction: Let it be, suppressed or avoidant)..... It took 2 year &amp; 9 months to repair the spine myself , so better if you can find a good chiropractor, I don’t know if child has to wait for the bones to become harden until teen age. If you want to fix it yourself, self-sense small itching and small tightness/pain on  neck/spine (over-thinking your will magnify your headaches and reduce your sensitivity of detection ) , both are close to the same point, twist/shake that position in any way until the bone shifts and sounding.... when doing repairs, half squatting or standing, it is often useful to straighten your waist and neck while relax the twisting parts (if not, the chances of mistakes likely be greater) ...light force &amp; careful before quite certain of dislocate direction &amp; situation (you guess through tension direction or unusual feeling that u felt)... If you are dealing with the twisted staircase pattern, sometimes you have to repeat this similar pattern to your joint order: 1, 2, 3, 4; 2, 3, 4, 5; 3, 4, 5, 6 is like trying to loosen screws that connect together, It’s easy to get stuck if not done in such way... To deal with a C-shaped neck dislocation at the shoulder (such as a hand fan), you need to shake upwards/to the opposite direction, just like trying to look up at the sky repeatedly hard...or drag it up while shaking spine like swinging rope in S pattern ...brain fog, tireness &amp; anxiety disappear gradually and completely after repaired completely due to neck vascular and brain tugging problems by unstable &amp; a bit twisting spine."

DZXjJVrm1Jw,"@Some person then see someone who knows it could be a plain therapist or a psychologist I have autism as well, and I know and have been told it comes in different forms."
DZXjJVrm1Jw,"@Some person It kind of does to be honest, autism comes in different forms and levels. Ask your parents about it, or if your parents don’t know, ask someone like a specialist. There are people in this world who know what it is."
DZXjJVrm1Jw,"@deadric8 it is curing if they got dislocate, the unnotice brain pain was reason of most symptom (u only understand when u notice those pain start to fade, ur energy came back, bad feeling dissapear as well but only after fix completely, brain pain distort ur daily feeling), I know my comm likely suck after so many yr lack of comm &amp; english also not my mother tongue"
DZXjJVrm1Jw,@CYNISTER PHVNK So do I. Welcome aboard.
DZXjJVrm1Jw,"hahahah oh man maybe its just all in my head, but I feel you."
DZXjJVrm1Jw,"It is true, People with autism are smarter with relationships and I have it and I have a girlfriend"
DZXjJVrm1Jw,@Elmo Watches YOU It&#39;s a subreddit. It means that the joke flew (&quot;whoosh&quot;) over your head.
DZXjJVrm1Jw,Idk what r whoosh  even means
DZXjJVrm1Jw,@Thomas Michael Do not recommend a diet like that.
DZXjJVrm1Jw,Me too i sad when i see them flsuffer
DZXjJVrm1Jw,"May God help you in this journey, brother. He loves you and accepts you ❤️"
DZXjJVrm1Jw,Doc Oyalo can reverse  autism with herbs and it’s completely perfect. I used it for my son and so far his speech is verbal and social skill is normal and he can now also respond to everything positively on his own.
DZXjJVrm1Jw,What do you mean?
DZXjJVrm1Jw,@Axroy Roblox thats why i need a doctor i suspect but do not know
DZXjJVrm1Jw,"I used this doc herbs for my son and now my son is completely free,  his speaking and behavior is ok. His herbs is 100% working on ASD. I met Dr Oyalo  on channel and I’m happy to share my experience about it. 😍😍"
DZXjJVrm1Jw,@Hayden Winfield That&#39;s really sweet. Your comment makes me feel really... safe somehow. I don&#39;t really have any friends or anyone around me that understand autism... so seeing that I&#39;m not alone makes me feel safe 🥰
DZXjJVrm1Jw,Autism Is Not A Curse Its A Gift Everyone That Autism Is Specially Gifted And I Think Of Anyone That Has Autism As My Bro Or Sis That I Deeply Care About So Stay Safe &amp; Keep Well
DZXjJVrm1Jw,Yup agree
DZXjJVrm1Jw,@Koen  Exactly!
DZXjJVrm1Jw,But I bet you can show your empathy very well by writing a letter or sending a mail to this person in which you show your empathy and sorrow for his loss .
DZXjJVrm1Jw,same
DZXjJVrm1Jw,same bc i would hate if my pets die
DZXjJVrm1Jw,"yep, recognize this..."
DZXjJVrm1Jw,@Stephanie yea it sucks I always feel bad about it afterwards I am far from a aggressive person and I dont want people to see me that way
DZXjJVrm1Jw,"Lol, that&#39;s what the doctor exactly said. Autistic people are NOT more violent than normal people."
DZXjJVrm1Jw,The only reason I would hurt someone is if I&#39;m having a meltdown and they all crowd around me
DZXjJVrm1Jw,Thats one person. You shouldn’t generalize all autistic people just by what your brother does.
DZXjJVrm1Jw,Same
DZXjJVrm1Jw,Same
DZXjJVrm1Jw,Me to
DZXjJVrm1Jw,@Cicada Boi oh wow! I was like this at school too.
DZXjJVrm1Jw,Are you me?
DZXjJVrm1Jw,@Codilee Caldwell what.
DZXjJVrm1Jw,depends on the child.
DZXjJVrm1Jw,So many are extra verbal and early
DZXjJVrm1Jw,@The E Guy when I was one I felt like I had really good communication skills then once I turned three all of a sudden things started flipping outside down.
DZXjJVrm1Jw,When he/she is ready
DZXjJVrm1Jw,dysfunctional camera 😂 forget to feed you ......wow ..... glad your good now 👍❤️
DZXjJVrm1Jw,@Charles Fraunhofer As if you were the expert on the subject. Stop spreading propaganda.
DZXjJVrm1Jw,Charles Fraunhofer I love ❤️ that my daughter is autistic.... she’s strong 💪 as heck though when she has her meltdowns but she’s also a Leo ♌️ so that fire 🔥 energy probably adds to it. I prayed to God for a spiritual intuitive child that is extremely 🥰 loving.... check check and she’s super beautiful added bonus . She will be three next month &amp; uses Repetitive words and sounds but not a complete sentence. It’s ok 👍 if she needs more time but her personality is so confident and she laughs by herself allot 😂 She stares close up to little objects for hours and does hand gestures..... hardest thing is blocking her from wanting to run up to people ( again super loving)....... All ok with me .... when her Doctor said she was concerned about her being Autistic I didn’t like that because it’s not cancer or something that will harm her...... so what if she has special ways of learning and dances when she feels good inside for no reason . I’m madly in love with her and she’s my dream daughter and I just need my son one day and then I am complete as a mom ❤️ So your wrong not all moms feel this way ..... sorry 😐 ❤️👍🥰
DZXjJVrm1Jw,I&#39;m a guy......and I dont care that nobody likes me atleast I&#39;ll find someone who loves me for me
DZXjJVrm1Jw,"@Goose Pirate I&#39;m a man and I&#39;m gentle to the men, I never hit a man, and you shouldn&#39;t ever hit a man either (it&#39;s illegal)."
DZXjJVrm1Jw,Doc Oyalo can reverse  autism with herbs and it’s completely perfect. I used it for my son and so far his speech is verbal and social skill is normal and he can now also respond to everything positively on his own.
aYCBdZLCDBQ,Welcome
aYCBdZLCDBQ,i love the way you described yourself. Most honest and raw way to; currently level 28 playing an African-American woman.
aYCBdZLCDBQ,"cool! I&#39;ll take these tips, I&#39;m stuck on that level"
aYCBdZLCDBQ,To punctuate on that point I think it is sufficient to point to Isaac Newton who was characteristically a loner and accomplished incredible feats.

aYCBdZLCDBQ,Ok

aYCBdZLCDBQ,@Sunshine Twe do it daily
aYCBdZLCDBQ,@Anantam Bisht I do meditate but not often.
aYCBdZLCDBQ,@Sunshine Twe you should try meditating and if things seem out of hand pls go to therapy
aYCBdZLCDBQ,@Sunshine Twe actuallynthese ages are not concrete. It is psychology not maths :) it is not like a guy at 21 was suffering from identity vs role confusion and a guy at 22 is suddenly suffering from isolation vs intimacy lol.
aYCBdZLCDBQ,I got it tmr..
aYCBdZLCDBQ,Good question!
aYCBdZLCDBQ,"UHFStation1 if you keep telling yourself that you have no creativity, then you lose your creativity. Start being more positive to your mind and it will come"
aYCBdZLCDBQ,wow same. I got messed up on role confusion and got up in isolationville for real. Got agoraphobia for a decade bc my parents made me stay inside. Was never allowed an identity outside my parents. I am trying to reverse some of my social anxiety
aYCBdZLCDBQ,Can you elaborate?
aYCBdZLCDBQ,"Mark bro it’s not that deep, I basically went through that and all that happened was a thought I was just not as naturally smart as my classmates"
aYCBdZLCDBQ,"@Wak Wak really terrible response you gave, especially from a psychological point of view. to say “nah they made their choices” to every individual that made bad choices is an extremely irrational and naive conclusion without considering other factors. poor mental health has a devastating effect on our neurological functions and will affect our decision making skills, which is evident in decades of research on psychological disorders. environmental factors also have an effect on how people behave. the point is, please do be more considerate and empathetic because there are plenty of people who suffer from mental health conditions and as a result, make bad choices that they can’t even control."
aYCBdZLCDBQ,@RaptorM82 oh shittt
aYCBdZLCDBQ,@RaptorM82 that explains a lot actually...

aYCBdZLCDBQ,Nouvelle Creation thank you very much
aYCBdZLCDBQ,I am psychology major student. I understand pictorial lecture much easier as compare to written lecture. My brain keeps pictorial info easily and for a long time. So i couldn&#39;t stop myself and asked you about it. I will be learning psychology more so i tend to visit here often or daily if i gets to see more valuable videos.
aYCBdZLCDBQ,you seem to be very interested in psychology. are you?
aYCBdZLCDBQ,thats great. very glad to hear that!
aYCBdZLCDBQ,that&#39;s great. Glad it did!
aYCBdZLCDBQ,Thank u! Glad you like it :)
aYCBdZLCDBQ,Thank you Rahman. Please help spread the word ;)
aYCBdZLCDBQ,Yeah we are taught that this stage is outdated in Healthcare but we still have to lean it. but the Maslow&#39;s Hierarchy stage is still relevant
aYCBdZLCDBQ,True
aYCBdZLCDBQ,"@Bill Elwood I don&#39;t think it&#39;s just that some of these are slower or faster than others, but that they also often overlap with each other. These are experiences people may go through at some point during these time periods, but it&#39;s odd to classify them as stages of development. I also speculate that many of these are more environmental rather than natural parts of human growth. For example, the reason Intimacy vs Isolation occurs in early adulthood in our culture is because that&#39;s when we&#39;re out of high school and lose much of our old support group.<br><br>Identity vs Role Confusion often extends into the college years, overlapping with early adulthood. Only, because it&#39;s occurring after someone is out on their own, the primary influencers are going to be completely different. Ego Integrity vs Despair could also be faced by anyone feeling their death is imminent. Say, through a terminal illness. And I&#39;m suspicious of the implication here that most trust issues stem from infancy."
aYCBdZLCDBQ,"I agree too, adolescence started for me when I was 11."
aYCBdZLCDBQ,This is meant to be more of a general idea about when certain things usually happen. Not everyone follows it to a T but more usually start and/or end each stage within the set time
aYCBdZLCDBQ,"read kegan instead, dude."
aYCBdZLCDBQ,Great video other than that.
aYCBdZLCDBQ,THANKS JIMENA -  THATS GREAT!

aYCBdZLCDBQ,Sprouts you got it!
aYCBdZLCDBQ,help spreading the word about our channel ;)
HBW5vdhr_PA,couldn&#39;t agree more. I felt like there was too much influence on the vibrancy and visual appeals of the characters rather  than the actions.
HBW5vdhr_PA,Same
HBW5vdhr_PA,@iRyannity I AM! Can’t you tell? DUH!! Seems you need to get a LIFE &amp; A JOB; responding to me…🤨
HBW5vdhr_PA,Morals are relative. There is no universal good and evil
HBW5vdhr_PA,same with the cat puppets
HBW5vdhr_PA,Sorry about the extreme autism...
HBW5vdhr_PA,Google is watching you. Believe it.
HBW5vdhr_PA,"&quot;(for when Gentiles that have not the law do by nature the things of the law, these, not having the law, are the law unto themselves; in that they show the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience bearing witness therewith, and their thoughts one with another accusing or else excusing them);&quot; <br>– The Bible, Romans 2.14 - 15 (ASV) (Emphasis added.)<br><br>Science is now showing what the Bible author knew 2000 years ago – that the law of God is written on our hearts and is in our very nature. People instinctively know it&#39;s wrong to murder or steal or lie or even just to be mean but rather to be nice (love your neighbor). We are born with this knowledge. <br><br>People can teach themselves to ignore their conscience but they are not born that way. It is also part of our nature to do evil. It is not the way we were created but it became our way when the first man and woman rejected God back in the garden. Our hearts are damaged and bent upon doing evil. Only the person who created the human heart can repair the damage to the human heart. That one is God. We cannot fix ourselves. We can work on ourselves and become better people but we cannot remove the sin from our hearts. <br><br>This is fascinating research!"
HBW5vdhr_PA,Lol right
HBW5vdhr_PA,Well psychopaths are born evil
HBW5vdhr_PA,Ah yes<br>Reading the article
HBW5vdhr_PA,🤣🤣
HBW5vdhr_PA,🤣
HBW5vdhr_PA,probably
HBW5vdhr_PA,🤣🤣🤣🤣
HBW5vdhr_PA,The main problem is<br>They talk about the methodology<br>But they didn&#39;t even read the article<br><br>It&#39;s actually easier to see if a result is correct than found the result
HBW5vdhr_PA,Nee York Times journalists
HBW5vdhr_PA,You can ignore the last bit. I&#39;m mostly curious on how fetal morphogenesis can lead people to misperceive children
HBW5vdhr_PA,"@Hbmd ah, that&#39;s related to gene expression and fetus morphogenesis<br><br>I&#39;m curious on how it was proven wrong? Also just to understand perspective but are you religious?"
HBW5vdhr_PA,@Greenhead Metal Chips Odcourse it does. <br>textbooks e.g teach that embryo of the human and fish has a gill slits. Even its proven wrong and professor who fist made the claim is judged by his own university of lying. Still after 100y that was used.  and some book even said that its not human e.g in 7months. children who are born 5 months have survived.
HBW5vdhr_PA,I&#39;ve never read such a confused comment before. What&#39;s embryo teaching and what does abortion got anything to do w how we perceive babies?
HBW5vdhr_PA,how? i dont see it
HBW5vdhr_PA,"@Andrew great, thx!"
HBW5vdhr_PA,They did. The variables were swapped around to avoid a simple bias to a certain color or shape.
HBW5vdhr_PA,"Please read the study, or at least the article related to this study. These variables were indeed swapped around to avoid this."
HBW5vdhr_PA,@Andrew yeah make sense know .. thanks
HBW5vdhr_PA,"The baby needs something it can latch onto as the identified for who is the good and the bad. If you made them too similar a child might not be able to differentiate between the two. The tests <i>were</i> however repeated with the swapping of &quot;who was the bad, who was the good&quot; to avoid a child&#39;s bias for a certain color or shape."
HBW5vdhr_PA,They would’ve switched this up
HBW5vdhr_PA,Can youtubers realize that a 5  minute video does not explain or show the whole study? That before they criticize the study they need to learn more about it?
HBW5vdhr_PA,p.s.  since when does an experimenter call the test subjects endearing names?  very unscientific.
HBW5vdhr_PA,"If this study is accurate, it could be used to find psychological issues extremely early"
HBW5vdhr_PA,not the orange a-hole cat lol
HBW5vdhr_PA,Oh yes and the &quot;good guys&quot; always seem to be lighter and brighter colours and the &quot;bad guys&quot; are darker and duller... obviously the child will most often go for the brighter one as it is a more interesting colour for children. There are too many design flaws in this study that make it invalid.
HBW5vdhr_PA,what of the stuffed animals?
HBW5vdhr_PA,"Uhm yeah, they should&#39;ve shown it in the video then"
HBW5vdhr_PA,"Eli Ri   In the full experiment, half the time the good one was yellow and half the time it was bad. Did you think this was the whole experiment?"
HBW5vdhr_PA,Not necessarily. These tests don&#39;t prove babies know right from wrong and even if they did it doesn&#39;t mean babies know every bad thing. Plus they are looking at things from the outside. It&#39;s easier to see which one did a good thing and which one did a bad thing
HBW5vdhr_PA,"infinity 2 Its the way babies initially explore, ie., through mouth (chewing, biting, sucking, etc.)"
HBW5vdhr_PA,"Matt E   If you read the full study you would see that they varied everything. The colors changed, the people offering the toys hadn’t seen which character was good or bad. Can’t judge by thirty seconds of video."
HBW5vdhr_PA,Lexie Rangel They did in the full experiment.
HBW5vdhr_PA,ILoveMyOrchids   Did you read the full study?
HBW5vdhr_PA,That&#39;s what the article says but unfortunately the video doesn&#39;t. It would have taken them 5 seconds to mention that they counterbalanced everything to ensure the test was valid. They also could have put it directly in the description.
HBW5vdhr_PA,Adrianne May   They switched everything up in the full experiment.
HBW5vdhr_PA,I didn’t see
HBW5vdhr_PA,"​@Joe Zingher Read the study, lol. That&#39;s exactly what they did. No offence, but they know how to conduct a study."
HBW5vdhr_PA,I said the same thing
HBW5vdhr_PA,They should have switched the pieces from one group of children to another so that 50% got the brighter piece being the nice guy and 50% got the darker piece being the nice guy;
HBW5vdhr_PA,"There are dozens of reasons why the babies might choose the &quot;right&quot; object, and only one of those is the conclusion given.<br><br>Even the clip showed clear bias by the presenter toward &quot;right&quot;.  If that was what was recorded and shown, I find it hard to believe the rest of the data is any better."
HBW5vdhr_PA,"King of Kings sure. But still a lot of ppl recognize that the alalysation result of this test can not be taken for granted because there are too many unknown or unclear factors auch as that babies recognize how adults react, or that the women might have hold the &quot;nice&quot; guy a bit closer to the baby."
HBW5vdhr_PA,She shakes it AFTER it was chosen.
HBW5vdhr_PA,larger sample sizes duh
HBW5vdhr_PA,i did lose braincells reading this
HBW5vdhr_PA,@Arkylie The presenter didn&#39;t see it
HBW5vdhr_PA,"and they smiled when the baby chose the right one - we know babies respond to positive attention, so they may have only chosen the good ones because they were led to choose it. babies are a lot more responsive to sound, emotion, and reaction which suggests their choices weren&#39;t completely original."
HBW5vdhr_PA,The child picked the yellow first and therefore preferred the yellow first.  That&#39;s the point made.  So it doesn&#39;t matter that it reached for the second one afterwards.  They were trying to find out preference.  Personally I think the baby just preferred the brighter color over the blander one.
HBW5vdhr_PA,this wasn&#39;t the whole study.  Just an excerpt from it.
HBW5vdhr_PA,It´s a 2 min video. Also if they always took away the &quot;right choise&quot; why do &quot;only&quot; 80% of the children choose it and not 100%
HBW5vdhr_PA,They did? Read the study
HBW5vdhr_PA,"Oh man, you&#39;d think several scientists with years of practice within the relevant field would think of that before you!!<br><br>Oh wait, they did, but you just didn&#39;t check the source of this video&#39;s material.<br><br>Critical thinking."
HBW5vdhr_PA,They alternate the colors. It&#39;s called counterbalancing.
HBW5vdhr_PA,"Um, I think they arleady did! The yellow tiger was the one preventing the other tiger from opening the box! Did you NOT see the video or am I being color blind here?!!!"
HBW5vdhr_PA,They switch around the colors each trial. Please actually read the study before you comment.
HBW5vdhr_PA,"...and properly-trained scientists. If a major news outlet is going to promote a scientific &quot;study,&quot; it needs to be conducted by people who know the elementary basics of eliminating extenuating factors. A fifth grader could&#39;ve done this experiment with more credibility. This is why I don&#39;t trust &quot;scientific&quot; studies."
HBW5vdhr_PA,"Not that this experiment is perfect at all lmao, not my poINT"
HBW5vdhr_PA,@lol wutlol ikr
HBW5vdhr_PA,This is one of the dumbest experiments I have ever seen. I don&#39;t even remember who was the bad guy or good guy.
HBW5vdhr_PA,@Koru Perhaps that should have been shown on the video!
HBW5vdhr_PA,"Yes, it&#39;s really stupid"
HBW5vdhr_PA,"They switched the colours each trial. Done over lots of babies with lots of tests, it’s pretty interesting"
HBW5vdhr_PA,that&#39;s why they did the study lol
HBW5vdhr_PA,I dont think so. Maybe the ability to retain sh &amp; preferences is a carry on thing tho. At least I see some of that in my kid.
HBW5vdhr_PA,@alia meow exactly.
HBW5vdhr_PA,And this is what prove that there is a power upon us that kind of programmed those values on us now this look really familiar &quot;god&quot;.
HBW5vdhr_PA,"Treestump &amp; Thunderarch   How can you judge when we only saw a tiny bit of the experiment? We don’t know how often they switched it up or how many different scenarios they offered. If everyone else thought about the color and handedness, they did too."
HBW5vdhr_PA,MrAtlfan21 you know how many times these guys were proven wrong throughout history ? Use your own brains
HBW5vdhr_PA,XD
HBW5vdhr_PA,"I am just curious, what may some of the other potential flaws in the design?"
HBW5vdhr_PA,Read the original study. It was double blind.
HBW5vdhr_PA,"Umm, if she doesn&#39;t know, then how will she be doing the test dummy! Lol!"
HBW5vdhr_PA,Babies tend to do what people want them to. 100% agree that there needs to be a double blind study.
HBW5vdhr_PA,Good idea
HBW5vdhr_PA,PaJeezy I agree. It should double blind.
HBW5vdhr_PA,The testers alternated the roles of the toys and got the same results
HBW5vdhr_PA,Angelica Alvarado the good toy was grey in the box skit. The bad toy was  yellow.
HBW5vdhr_PA,"@Ayana Sioux I find it funny that you think there are no aspects to criticize in this video. Even if the research is more complex, then the criticism is against what was shown in the video. No reason to dismiss valid criticism."
HBW5vdhr_PA,@ToukenDanshiWarrior it was.
HBW5vdhr_PA,Assuming that a 5 min video will capture all the nuances of a research study that likely spanned months if not years is exactly what is expected from YouTube audience. Also assuming that scientific researchers at Yale know nothing about statistics and double-blind studies and have to take lessons from &quot;YouTube scientists&quot; is also exactly what one expects from a YouTube audience.
HBW5vdhr_PA,@Arkylie 1. They didn&#39;t see it. 2. Yes. 3. What&#39;s important is that they can tell the difference.<br>(Got the first two from the top comment)
HBW5vdhr_PA,Yeah but I like the shapes with eyes
HBW5vdhr_PA,It looks fun! Coming from someone that wants to be a future parent.
HBW5vdhr_PA,There was just something very unsettling about all of these people right?
HBW5vdhr_PA,I like participating in baby history. <br>(Enter the babies wearing Troy Roman helmets and swords)
HBW5vdhr_PA,"@Krabby Krabby also, they act as if they were in the room with the babies and editing doesn’t exist."
HBW5vdhr_PA,They show it to them like 15 times till they get bored. Do ya&#39;ll watch the whole thing?
HBW5vdhr_PA,No that’s just you😂
HBW5vdhr_PA,omg it was literally like 3 seconds long wtf
HBW5vdhr_PA,I got confused
HBW5vdhr_PA,"@Aunty Googol a baby&#39;s body is made to move symmetrical in all ways as a safety precaution until around the age of 3 when they are more stable to choose a dominant side. Issues with muscle tone, or neurological issues are often the cause of babies having a dominant side by this age such as low or high tone, or CP. Around school age is when a typical child is pushed into finding a dominant side."
HBW5vdhr_PA,"Babies this young shouldn&#39;t have a hand preference yet. They should still be ambidextrous, using both hands equally."
HBW5vdhr_PA,"kayla roeten Congratulations, you aren&#39;t a baby."
HBW5vdhr_PA,J Park <br>Babies? Im 13 years old and im bias to my dominant side
HBW5vdhr_PA,Amy-Imogen Tanzer That’s when adults notice it but hand dominance must always be there or why would a child prefer one hand pver another at any age?
HBW5vdhr_PA,They vary it
HBW5vdhr_PA,My thoughts exactly.
HBW5vdhr_PA,But the triangle was on the left.
HBW5vdhr_PA,Julie D I agree
HBW5vdhr_PA,"You don&#39;t think the puppets might have played different roles throughout testing to avoid such bias? And, yeah, they should&#39;ve totally shown you all the babies they tested, because what is more appealing to a parent then a video of their kid being shown around on the Internet?...Also, ofcourse they did something more concrete to show than this filmsy youtube video <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3076932/"">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3076932/</a>"
HBW5vdhr_PA,"@Scarlet&#39;s Sanctuary so you give them enough credit to have been born knowing good from bad, but you won´t give them enough credity to have a better than 2 minute memory of an event repeating itself 14 times? seems legit. Kind of sums up the comment section idiots too"
HBW5vdhr_PA,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBW5vdhr_PA&amp;t=2m46s"">2:46</a> &gt;80% of the time. I don&#39;t think so."
HBW5vdhr_PA,This is one of the dumbest experiments I have ever seen. I don&#39;t even remember who was the bad guy or good guy.
HBW5vdhr_PA,They watched each show like 6 - 14 times though and this was done with lots of babies to eliminate that chance. They also switched up the “good” and “bad” toys a lot.
HBW5vdhr_PA,"@Scarlet&#39;s Sanctuary but if they focus on the first doll that made all the commotion, and noticed that the good toy/doll never left the stage, they may have been eyeing it the whole time"
HBW5vdhr_PA,yeah i thought the same thing
HBW5vdhr_PA,+szoszk They did switch the characters up.
HBW5vdhr_PA,"They switch up which object does which action, genius."
HBW5vdhr_PA,"I googled it, and found a video about this on a different site. They did actually switch things up."
HBW5vdhr_PA,"Ayana Sioux Art also very true, they see shades of grey up until a certain age"
HBW5vdhr_PA,"If what you&#39;re saying is true why do newborns (meaning seconds old) prefer symmetrical faces over less attractive ones?<br><br>You don&#39;t &quot;learn&quot; what is attractive, nor do you &quot;learn&quot; good and bad. You learn what not to do because of the consequences. But a very young child doesn&#39;t grasp any real moral concepts. If you asked them &quot;Should this puppet/person die?&quot; they wouldn&#39;t have a clue what it means. They don&#39;t know anything about any real consequences, thus they aren&#39;t &quot;educated&quot; on moral matters. Their responses are instinct until they learn to make decisions based on understood consequences."
HBW5vdhr_PA,The point of the experiment is to understand  whether  or not they NEED to undergo experiences  inorder to develop  a conscience.
HBW5vdhr_PA,And what if the bad guy helps the good guy by pushing it down? The scenario doesnt make any sense.
HBW5vdhr_PA,"@paultardspambot Can&#39;t agree more.  I only say that because my little bro from about 6 months till at least 1 preferred me and my mom over everyone else (my dad, and other two sisters) because we gave him what he wanted most often.  Babies seem to recognize the most helpful people around them."
HBW5vdhr_PA,"A person with no scientific qualifications criticising actual scholars without looking out all the factors, and reading the actual paper! A typical comment on the internet."
HBW5vdhr_PA,@Talisguy Babies are not able to distinguish their body from the world surrounding them so I really doubt they can manipulate abstract concepts.
HBW5vdhr_PA,@Talisguy Thanks. Such a setup would help eliminate unintentional signaling by the adults.
HBW5vdhr_PA,"@Voyageur In the test I saw, the one where the person holding the puppets went in blind, it was two dog puppets playing with a tiger puppet as they passed a ball. The &quot;good&quot; puppet returned the ball. The &quot;bad&quot; puppet stole the ball. <br><br>I can believe that babies might be developed enough to understand &quot;I don&#39;t want to have my toys stolen and the &#39;bad&#39; puppet steals toys&quot;, even if I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a sign of morality, exactly."
HBW5vdhr_PA,@Talisguy The test is still 100% bs since the baby cant comprehend that going upward= good.
HBW5vdhr_PA,"There&#39;s been at least one repeat of this experiment where the presenter explicitly didn&#39;t know which was the &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot; toy, and the result was that 70% of babies chose the &quot;good&quot; toy. In case you were wondering."
HBW5vdhr_PA,Vinay Seth Ikr
HBW5vdhr_PA,@drspastic well thats really a narrow perspective on psychology. Maybe your teacher were crap but psychology def isnt.
HBW5vdhr_PA,@Aniya marie Scott  You gonna elaborate on that?
HBW5vdhr_PA,@Will Brooks exactly
HBW5vdhr_PA,@Your Majesty I used to be a student of psychology I joined because I genuinely thought it would help me understand the way people thought and behaved however I soon realised it was just another pile of crap where I had to learn to regurgitate what some guy said in a book whether it was true or not. older lecturers were biased and all the experiments wood designed to give a certain result. in the end I stood up and walked out and so did free other students. the rest just died for their grades
HBW5vdhr_PA,"They show the character struggling to get up the hill first.  So it&#39;s established what he&#39;s trying to do.  And when he is pushed down the hill, he was heading upwards before getting pushed down."
HBW5vdhr_PA,"the circle wanted to get up the hill, that was simply shown. this was supported when the triangle helped it get there. we know the square was the &#39;bad guy&#39; because he was counterproductive.  we don&#39;t know if the babies understood this the way we do, but based on assumption that they understood who was &#39;good&#39; and &#39;bad&#39; by picking their favourite characters. there are flaws in this experiment though for sure."
HBW5vdhr_PA,"Because 80% of the babies chose the “good” toy, even when the colour was changed. This was done over lots of babies and they were made to watch the different shows 6-14 times. There was other shows that weren’t just about the hill."
HBW5vdhr_PA,Because he’s trying to get up the hill and one of the characters help attain that goal and the other are antagonistic towards that goal.
HBW5vdhr_PA,"@GreenLightMe bit much, but I get what you&#39;re saying."
HBW5vdhr_PA,LolzSquid 😂😂😂
HBW5vdhr_PA,Elizabeth Casillas tested for what? A conscience? Lmao
HBW5vdhr_PA,Yale University.  Ask for Dr. Paul Bloom.
HBW5vdhr_PA,Jascha Bull ok tho
HBW5vdhr_PA,"I&#39;ve worked in an infant lab before. We always tell the parents before the experiment begins to try their best to not to influence the baby whatsoever and to act completely neutral as possible. Some of the babies would turn around to look at their parent&#39;s face but as long as the parent didn&#39;t react, the experiment always turned out well."
HBW5vdhr_PA,"@Alex <br>I suspected that was the reason, though one would think good researchers would come up with some way to compensate for confounding data like that."
HBW5vdhr_PA,"There is a control group where they just present the two shapes at first, and when they present the shapes with no faces. In both cases the babies show no preference."
HBW5vdhr_PA,They switch around the colors each trial. Please actually read the study before you comment.
HBW5vdhr_PA,"@Liminal handedness comes only after three years, before that, its cosidered pathological."
HBW5vdhr_PA,Well the triangle was on the presenters right side which would be the babies left side. That being said they could be left handed or they could just prefer their left side for whatever reason
HBW5vdhr_PA,"In the first one the puppets are basically Sponge-bob and Squidward. Even without any actions the kids will naturally be drawn to spongebob (by design), and they will always be drawn to the star (gets the most airtime). So the puppet&#39;s time during the play plus the look of the puppet and the way it moves around are all going to be the things that determine the results. I&#39;m pretty sure Marketing companies already have this stuff figured out. <br>If they wanted answers they should have just gone to Pixar or Disney instead if doing the test. I mean, it doesn&#39;t just apply to babies. Anyone who has read up on &quot;Game-ification&quot; knows what animations, bright colors, and positive feedback sounds will do to people&#39;s brains.<br>I wonder which thing a person will pick:<br>1: A piece if the Tri Force from Zelda.<br>2: A grey square<br><br>Just ask the secret societies. Golden pyramid, or grey square. I think I know what they would pick lol."
HBW5vdhr_PA,I’d feel like I’m playing all day 😂
HBW5vdhr_PA,+Sarah Dawn Green just maybe change a few things and run it more in depth
HBW5vdhr_PA,"I noticed that too and slightly agree that the experiment is not the most dependable. It could be said that the babies only reach for the triangle because it&#39;s bright yellow and babies are attracted to bright colors! <br><br>I feel like to assume that the babies actually perceive the block as evil just because it pushes the circle down the hill or reversed for the triangle, is kind of a stretch! <br><br>If they made both the square and triangle the same color then we&#39;d be on to something, but at this juncture it kind of seems like the experiment is rigged for the babies to choose the &quot;correct&quot; one, but then what is the point of that? What have they really learned that they didn&#39;t already know 🤷‍♀️🤷‍♂️"
HBW5vdhr_PA,She probably just wanted to play with them and thought they were getting both toys
HBW5vdhr_PA,I noticed that.
HBW5vdhr_PA,💀
HBW5vdhr_PA,I thought the same thing!
HBW5vdhr_PA,"Have you really looked Yale latey? This is the same school that had one campus that had students yelling at faculty &quot;&#39;It&#39;s not about creating an intellectual space, It&#39;s about creating a home&quot; (I cut out some of the middle of the quote. But it doesn&#39;t change the meaning of it any) and there are many more gems like that. Sure this was not the science campus. But still this is the level of what the &quot;quality&quot; of students they are letting in now a days. And this has been going on for over a decade now. This is getting to be the level of most colleges except in the sciences (and then only in the hardest sciences like physics and math and engineering) and even they are starting down the same path and have been for years now."
HBW5vdhr_PA,Help=right; Harm= wrong
HBW5vdhr_PA,"I was thinking that it&#39;s in a baby&#39;s survival interests to be able to distinguish between a person who&#39;s likely to help them, and one who might harm them."
HBW5vdhr_PA,@Wake Up even there the scenario doesnt make sense.
HBW5vdhr_PA,"I was thinking the same. They would have to switch roles in some of the experiments so that the yellow triangle isn&#39;t always the good one in order to avoid other possible reasons for the choice. The color could play a role as well as other factors, although I do believe that conscience is God-given."
HBW5vdhr_PA,Truee
HBW5vdhr_PA,Zach Findley Good argument
HBW5vdhr_PA,Totally agree.
HBW5vdhr_PA,"As interesting of an observation as this is, no, only because, wouldn’t that render the study pointless? In other words, if each of the characters had the same color and shape, how exactly would the babies be able to distinguish which character is which when given the option to choose which one they prefer? At least one of those two things (i.e. color &amp; shape) have to differ between the characters."
HBW5vdhr_PA,"More importantly, how bumping the character down is bad in this scenario for a baby??"
HBW5vdhr_PA,@Athe Ismo FEMALE
HBW5vdhr_PA,@Bella123 yet not all the good characters were on the right. I think that is why they do several situations.
HBW5vdhr_PA,How would the baby tell the difference afterward if they both identical :/
HBW5vdhr_PA,They switched colors. This video just didn&#39;t show it.
HBW5vdhr_PA,They did lol
HBW5vdhr_PA,"Oh my god, they are doing all kinds of studies! This isn&#39;t the only one."
HBW5vdhr_PA,Their just BABIES dude 😧
HBW5vdhr_PA,He means for some babies have the triangle be the good guy and others have the square be the good one not with the same baby. The biggest problem obviously is we can&#39;t ask the babies who is good and who is bad. There can be multiple reasons why they picked one object over the other. From the roll the object played to its shape to the color even which side the object is on. Though it&#39;s very unlikely every baby that picked the good object did so because of some other reason than its roll it&#39;s still a possibility. The way you reduce that possibility is by testing a large group and switching things up
HBW5vdhr_PA,+Tsunami! :o You&#39;re depressed a lot of the time because you feel people don&#39;t appreciate you.
HBW5vdhr_PA,Kinda true lol
HBW5vdhr_PA,"Babies can already tell the difference. Like da faq. If mommy&#39;s only cry&#39;s when Daddy home, the baby will sense that. If big sister is always pushing little brother down, the baby will see that. Babies cry when they see the freaking Easter bunny when they trying to hug. They do what they want cuz that know how to play the game. Baby geniuses."
HBW5vdhr_PA,I think they chose the brighter color 😬
HBW5vdhr_PA,"mayve they just pick the cutest one or the one that the woman are loking to and saying in her head &quot;THERE YOU GO BB, THIS IS THE GOOD GUY, PICK HIM YES THERE YOU GO&quot;"
HBW5vdhr_PA,"you are both wrong. Some people are born good and some people are born bad. Just like some people are born dumb or smart.<br>There is a part of the brain that deals with empathy, some people are born with it health and working well and these people are good. <br>Some people are literally born without this part of the the brain or they may be born with it underdeveloped or not working very well, these people are born psychopaths."
HBW5vdhr_PA,"I don&#39;t think we&#39;re born good or bad, I think those things are Dependant on enviournment but its simple minded to dismiss someone as being entirely good or bad or in between because humans are more complex then that and we need to understand what drives people to do what they do"
HBW5vdhr_PA,"Regarding yellow being a brighter color - if you notice in the last experiment, it&#39;s the grey cat that&#39;s the nice cat, yellow/orange cat is mean."
HBW5vdhr_PA,Or they choose the one they saw first. Hopefully they knew to control for these factors by reversing everything.
HBW5vdhr_PA,"I thought the same thing! I would try doing the experiment a few times (probably on separate occasions a week or so apart) with the same children where the the same characters are used but the roles are reversed to see if this is actually accurate, as well as use other children, so the risk of the children remembering the last experiment isn&#39;t too much a problem."

8I2hrSRbmHE,Welcome
8I2hrSRbmHE,You tell em Ms. McGraw👍
8I2hrSRbmHE,Can anyone explain the impact of technology using his theory ?😭
8I2hrSRbmHE,"yes, most people who study educational psychology agree that all views on knowledge have pros/cons and you should use a mixture of them. Also, that teachers have to adapt to every classroom and individual"
8I2hrSRbmHE,Good point!
8I2hrSRbmHE,:)
8I2hrSRbmHE,:D happy to
8I2hrSRbmHE,@Sir Meow The Library Cat I believe the stages were described to me in the course I took as being more concrete-  meaning with very little flexibility concerning the ages by which a child should develop a certain skill set.
8I2hrSRbmHE,"🤔 You may have misunderstood Piaget and his use of ‘concrete’. He created a spectrum of learning circumstances that begin with the concrete ie actual, tangible objects then moved along to the abstract, theoretical level. A child’s experiences as described by Vygotsky would complement the ideas presented by Piaget in environmental terms. What is so significant is the emphasis on the child developing as an independent learner over time. Take into account Maslow and his Hierarchy of Needs, then include Bloom’s Taxonomy (for teachers) and you have a robust educational format upon which to construct a valid syllabus that has relevance for all students."
8I2hrSRbmHE,"I mean, yeah. Vygotsky was dead before anyone was ever even diagnosed with autism. Psychology wasn&#39;t particularly advanced at the time, and is still evolving even now."

8I2hrSRbmHE,"PS one of the most effective ways to teach is to NOT TELL them anything!   Just keep ASKING them QUESTIONS.    After awhile, ask them what question you are about to ask.   When they can tell you, point out to them that they really didn&#39;t need you."
8I2hrSRbmHE,"LISTEN to those feelings!   Because often you ARE!     More often than not, ESPECIALLY with young kids, what you learn from the PROCESS of learning is far more valuable than the actual material you learn.<br><br>The most important learning of all, is learning how to THINK and how to LEARN FOR YOURSELF."
8I2hrSRbmHE,I agree  with  you.  Been   teacher  it&#39;s always  important  for the children  to explore on their own using their senses. Give them chance to share their ideas and to use the imagination.   Looking at the two  theories  both  are important.

8I2hrSRbmHE,The simplist explanation is that someone believes what is said (or done) to the extent that they feel that they deserve abuse (for instance) or become an abuser or believe that they are stupid and thus cannot learn
8I2hrSRbmHE,"Hi Johannes Duelund, thanks for the feedback! We are working on it."

8I2hrSRbmHE,Soviet Psychology ! Our Psychology :)
8I2hrSRbmHE,research has shown tremendous benefits for individuals with special needs from learning with a more knowledgeable other.
8I2hrSRbmHE,Thanks for sharing! Very interesting. Wonder that leanings he didn’t do watching videos. Thoughts?
8I2hrSRbmHE,@Sprouts sir after payment I think I will be login to this page ??

8I2hrSRbmHE,"Is that inequity, partialiality or comparison in students?"
8I2hrSRbmHE,kindly elaborate why? what limitations are those?
8I2hrSRbmHE,Rafael Tapia it’s from when your playing club penguin and making pizza LMAO
8I2hrSRbmHE,"like the melody in the background, does anyone know what it is?"
8I2hrSRbmHE,"Our interlocutor might be able to put into words a concept that we may have been thinking however unable to express through language thus establishing a stronger definition of said mental concept. Now, given new information, we can then communicate our ideas better. Great for solving mental problems we may be stuck on working out."
8I2hrSRbmHE,"Hi Rafael, you sound like you have some knowledge in that field. Why do you think learning how to walk does not fall into the category? And can you give me an example you think would be better for explaining?"
8I2hrSRbmHE,Thanks a lot

8I2hrSRbmHE,"I am glad you mentioned that because I thought the same about people without speech. At one point it is said that Vygosky thought this for all form of learning. Learning happens every day and every seconds. Now what is learnt will differ depending on where we are, what knowledge matters most, what tools, and of course the MKO, but learning happens. The value of the learning acquired depends only on the measurement used. I have a child that has been discouraged in taking his GCSEs because of his high level of dyslexia. I put enough pressure on the school to make sure that he takes the core units, so to give him a chance for success, and the education system gave me hell for that choice. Anyway, though still having tremendous fine motor skills issue, still not being able to write, my son is undertaking his second year at university studying sport management. So learning occurs if MKO are in place, that include tools and equipment: a tree is a MKO to learn climbing, no need for an brand new Ikea furniture."
8I2hrSRbmHE,"I believe the deaf learn language in other ways of learning. Doesn&#39;t have to be heard,"
8I2hrSRbmHE,Very good point!
8I2hrSRbmHE,That&#39;s the disadvantage of this theory.  It&#39;s not accurate
8I2hrSRbmHE,Do you learn faster with a good teacher or not? Vigotsky says that you learn faster with a good guide or teacher. Practice language with someone and you will learn faster. He never says you do not have a choice. Or ar you learning anything from the social interaction here in the comments. Vygotsky says you do. Prove him wrong if you like to. :)
8I2hrSRbmHE,depends on what country you are in.
8I2hrSRbmHE,@Sohanlal Dewasi The drawings are hand-drawn by Pascal Gaggelli and the animation is done by artists at Minutevideos. (It&#39;s all listed at the end of the video)<br>:)
8I2hrSRbmHE,@Sprouts which software you used making animatiom
8I2hrSRbmHE,Thanks Sohanlal!
8I2hrSRbmHE,:)
8I2hrSRbmHE,That was just a example
8I2hrSRbmHE,They were just using that as an example
8I2hrSRbmHE,"Nel. No pasa nada, hay subtitulos en inglés y tengo traductor google jeje todo ok 👍"
8I2hrSRbmHE,Wonderful!
8I2hrSRbmHE,"IMHO natural curiosity plus ACCESS TO GOOD MATERIALS is all that&#39;s really needed.<br><br>My experience was that schools were there to babysit the kids, not to teach.   The more you already knew, the more of a &quot;problem&quot; you were (&quot;what do I DO with him!&quot; etc)     It wasn&#39;t about learning, it was about keeping the kids busy whether what they were busy at was doing them any good or boring them to tears.   The most important thing of all was that they all be treated as identical units and all be doing the same thing at the same time.<br><br>ALL of kids&#39; natural instincts DRIVE them to LEARN.    For those that don&#39;t have physiological problems, when they don&#39;t it&#39;s always that adults are getting in the way of the process even if (sometimes especially if!) they are trying to help.<br><br>It&#39;s the SCHOOLS that are so screwed up, not the kids!"
8I2hrSRbmHE,Their***
8I2hrSRbmHE,"Thank you Kanye, very cool!"
8I2hrSRbmHE,@Sprouts yes exactly
8I2hrSRbmHE,"Hi SiMe, I have to admit that I felt very similar at first when reading about Vygotsky. But I came to see it differently. I think the major issues Vygotsky raised are still today relevant questions: <br>Does a child have to reach a certain &quot;natural&quot; maturity before it can learn and understand certain things? <br>What effect does the support of a teacher really have on the students learning process? <br>And how important is language as a factor of shaping our thoughts and our cognitive development?"
8I2hrSRbmHE,sanaol ano?
8I2hrSRbmHE,"@Raigh DarkHawk I think because so many people with social anxiety have coopted the term and insist that they fan’s talk on the phone because, “I’m an introvert.”"
8I2hrSRbmHE,"@Marlyn Nieves Not at all. I am an introvert, but I thrive, intellectually, upon discourse with others. Exchanging ideas, in fact, is one of my favorite ways to learn new concepts. Introverts are often mistakenly attributed the traits of someone with social anxiety; many people think that introverts hate being around others. While some introverts are shy, and indeed I was and still can be, introverts do not, by definition, dislike being around other people. Rather it is a matter of where we get our energy from. Unlike extroverts, who thrive and get a a charge from being around others- the more the merrier- introverts can deal with others, even with large groups, but need alone time to recharge, as gatherings tend to drain us of our energy. (PS I am a psychology major.)"
8I2hrSRbmHE,Introverts nightmare
8I2hrSRbmHE,The Zone of proximal development is not the comfort zone. The comfort zone refers to a place of familiarity and... comfort. The ZPD is a enviroment where someone can be taught.
8I2hrSRbmHE,oh boy oh boy
8I2hrSRbmHE,@Daniel Paulson it&#39;s still sarcasm even if there&#39;s more meaning to it.
8I2hrSRbmHE,Because their reaction to that is annoying the hell out of you and breaking your things. (Serious answer to sarcastic comment)
8I2hrSRbmHE,@Sprouts Oh thank heavens!
8I2hrSRbmHE,@Neha Kulkarni This was a sarcastic comment ;)
8I2hrSRbmHE,@Sprouts I think neglect is a strong term to agree to....
8I2hrSRbmHE,@magicbuskey well said
8I2hrSRbmHE,@magicbuskey I very much agree! This supports the notion that learning have many paths of development or is context specific rather than universal.
8I2hrSRbmHE,Assistance is a box we have to grow out of. We should progress beyond primitive culture. Beyond what is known there can be no assistance.
8I2hrSRbmHE,"btw the rebuk&#39;s cube was invented in 1974. even pre agricultural revolution we needed to learn thing from our parents to be better off in the world. critical thinking is taught and made easier by living a life with lots of free time. the athenians in ancients greece had slaves, they lived a life of luxory. without the slaves we wouldnt have all the rich amount of philosophy that came out of thinkers such as plato Socrates and aristotle. (not saying that this morally justified there use of slavery, thats a whole nother decision.) im not really argueing woth you tbh. i just like trying to reframe discussions in this way. maybe its pointless but its fun so i keep doing it haha."
8I2hrSRbmHE,@Generic Name I cannot deny that you present a valid point.
8I2hrSRbmHE,@Sprouts already on it..... love all your videos uploaded...well it did help me in my academics to understand different theories better..... I did have a slight liking for the psychology...and read books related to psychology during my spare time...... also I came across faymen technique for the first time through this channel....and started applying it to whatever I had to read....it did wonders..... I realized that it was pseudo understanding of the subject I had until I came across this.....thank you😃😃

WjOowWxOXCg,Parents are the first teachers. There is an alarming rate of children who do not respect authority because they do not respect their parents.

WjOowWxOXCg,"In an ideal world... <br>I&#39;ve been on Maternity leave for the past 5 months, one more month and it&#39;s back to work for me... Either I get a nanny, send my baby to daycare or quit my job in which case I will be indebted to my employer for quitting immediately after them having paid my salary in full for the 1st 4 months of my 6 months mat leave🤷‍♀️"
WjOowWxOXCg,Sure
WjOowWxOXCg,Noted. On our website we have all videos without it
WjOowWxOXCg,☹she will be ok with your love and care.
WjOowWxOXCg,Our early childhood (0-5) has a profound impact on our school performance (6-17) believe it or not
WjOowWxOXCg,This is what I want to do too :) bc i lacked these things
WjOowWxOXCg,"Probably has a lot to do with feeding, I just watched a video recently of a mom and baby’s sleep habits and the comments pointed out that she’s always being “called” by the baby’s cries for feeding, every 1-4 hours and she sleeps in the bed with mom<br>There’s something called weaning off of breastfeeding, where eventually you schedule feedings to be longer time between. Instead of 1-4 hours, make baby wait 5-6 hours. Once that schedule has been accomplished, make baby wait 7-8 hours. Then, you have a full nights sleep and a baby who’s internal feeding schedule is fixed<br>I hope that helps you, otherwise maybe baby is too cold? I wish you and your baby the best"
WjOowWxOXCg,"i know i may not be able to completely understand what you have been going through physically, mentally, and emotionally in your life. but that must be hard for u, must be painful and helpless. you are right. start expressing your feelings. people hear you now. i hope that you feel warm and supported. and i want you to know that you are loved. taking this step of open up your wounds, face it and talk about it needs a lot of courage. i am so proud of you!"
WjOowWxOXCg,Thanks for sharing this!
WjOowWxOXCg,@Nazgûl that&#39;s nice to know. I am 40 years old. Currently I am going through different articles on attachment style so that I can help my self change. Thanks.
WjOowWxOXCg,@I am enough - PJS no problem. I am a MSc in developmental psychology doing a module in attachment (currently writing 2 assignments on attachment). dont mind me asking but how old are you now?
WjOowWxOXCg,"@Nazgûl thank you makes sense, i never knew these attachments do shift this way. That means if I work hard I can move from my current attachment style, it&#39;s such a struggle to be in it. Thank you for your time and patience in replying. 😊🙏"
WjOowWxOXCg,"@I am enough - PJS Id say that as you grow older (i.e. adolescence), your attachment will shift from that of your parents to your peers. Since you said that you never had a healthy relationship with your peers, this may have caused a shift in your attachment patterns will may have lead to a more anxious insecure pattern."
WjOowWxOXCg,@Nazgûl for some reason I guess I never had a healthy relationship with my peers. Truma may be growing  up seeing my parents struggle and sturggling to understand why am I different from others and struggles with my orientation.
WjOowWxOXCg,"Check the description of the video, they list three types of therapy."
WjOowWxOXCg,experience what?
WjOowWxOXCg,all my relations!
WjOowWxOXCg,"♥️ we’ll get through this. the trauma is real, but so is our survival"
WjOowWxOXCg,"@Sprouts The realization alone is a sign of improvement, good for you! (:<br>The video helped me nonetheless, thank you."
WjOowWxOXCg,We were fools back then
WjOowWxOXCg,Thanks for sharing
WjOowWxOXCg,Sounds like you do everything right
WjOowWxOXCg,I hated it when people told me to put my baby down and let him cry it out  bc he would be spoiled but I told them he needs all the comfort and love he needs that’s not spoiling a baby comforting him
WjOowWxOXCg,I try to be the best I can

WjOowWxOXCg,Later childhood starts at age 6 bc then u can be admitted in grade school.. until 11. 0-5 early childhood..
WjOowWxOXCg,You are SOOOOO correct!!
WjOowWxOXCg,"Ikr my parents raised me completely horribly..i am 15. I have commitment issues despite not even having my first relationship. I am pretty positive that i don&#39;t want a child, not because i don&#39;t want it, but because I don&#39;t want add another person with miserable life to this world, I&#39;ve had enough and it ends now and here with me."
WjOowWxOXCg,"Yeah, whether it&#39;s an animal or child that they have to take care of, parents often stick to doing the bare minimum, but expect perfect behaviour and unconditional love. If they want a toy, that they can push aside when they feel like it, then get a fricken toy."
WjOowWxOXCg,Your anecdotes don&#39;t trump actual science. Only arrogant narcissists believe they know better than experts.
WjOowWxOXCg,100% I don’t believe that statement at all.
WjOowWxOXCg,I can relate
WjOowWxOXCg,@mary nassuna Please explain &quot;house&quot;?
WjOowWxOXCg,House
WjOowWxOXCg,"@Sleepy Sprout Yes, that&#39;s pretty much what I said, but you said it more clearly. So many people think that parents are intrinsically loving and competent - certainly most parents are loving and competent-ish: and refuse to acknowledge he existence of the not loving and totally incompetent going on damaging. <br>I didn&#39;t realise quite how damaging mine were until long after they were both dead. I just knew I didn&#39;t want to have much or anything to do with them, but not really why. I have no idea what I&#39;d do differently if I knew what they were doing, and they were still alive. Probably the same as I did before I knew. <br>Nor do I know why they did what they did, although they both had invisibly dysfunctional upbringings, which probably explains why. <br>The most constructive thing we can do is take what we know, and break the mould. IMHO."
WjOowWxOXCg,"@Lesley Vivien that&#39;s simply not the case when their best was abuse and neglect. Their &quot;best&quot; never existed because they never cared and that&#39;s for so many people. <br>But yes, you&#39;re right. If they actually cared for their children they&#39;d attempt to educate themselves and go to therapy with their children. <br>We shouldn&#39;t be expected to forgive them for hurting us. Letting go is one thing but if the other party isn&#39;t going to try- forgiving them is just as toxic to ourselves as what they did to us while we were growing up."
WjOowWxOXCg,If you made mistakes go to JESUS only JESUS can heal our damage in mind or feeling
WjOowWxOXCg,"Not to worry. I think what the message boils down to is connection with your kids. Eye contact, asking how they are, what they need, and closing with how much you care... then DO what you say. Kids have to learn how to navigate separation from primary caregivers from a very early age. It is simply a necessity of life. I remember crying uncontrollably when my mother would put on hairspray and perfume because it meant she was leaving and without me. I was 4. If she had let me know where she was going, when she would be back and then returned at that time mentioning she was back... it would have gone better. She worked at night. They say kids heal faster from a beating then being left alone or shunned. Showing affection, attention, and doing what you say will make a world of difference even if your time is limited, you work alot, or your kids are being raised by someone else. QUALITY time and not abusing or neglecting them is most of the battle."
WjOowWxOXCg,"But they can heal. Unfortunately many negative world experiences may have already filled their emotional cupboard by that time of realization, so there will be work that needs doing."
WjOowWxOXCg,"You just can&#39;t make messing up the default.  You get dozens, hundreds of chances to be a reliable human for them emotionally.  If you are so unreliable that they learn they can&#39;t come to you when the world is too scary, THEN you mess them up."
WjOowWxOXCg,"a secure attachment is formed when the parent gives the child a consistent place to return to. if you, as a parent, fail to give a place only a few times while raising the child, then there will be a secure attachment. but if you are inconsistent often enough that your child consequentially does not believe that there is a safe place, or &quot;home base&quot;, for them, then an insecure attachment is formed."
WjOowWxOXCg,"Honestly same I feel so lucky and greatful for my great parents,and always make sure that they know that I love them back and I always will.<br>A lot of people I know aren&#39;t as lucky as me and that&#39;s really sad I can&#39;t even begin to imagine how it feels to not have your parents to rely on when you need to,I send a lot of love to everyone going through hell because of their neglectful parents,<br> I hope they can heal as they grow up,wish everyone the best,I&#39;m prayng for you,stay strong and brave I adnire you,you all deserve a place in this world even if your parents make you feel like you aren&#39;t worth it,ypu truly are,trust me,take care and keep fighting,stay safe and never give up, much love💓💙🙏"
WjOowWxOXCg,@Andika Maghardene auguro il meglio💪🌈
WjOowWxOXCg,Helo Francisco.  Non essere troppo duro con te stesso.  non sei solo.  ci preoccupiamo

WjOowWxOXCg,"what is done is hard to be undone especially if it is something to do with the brain, but if you show support and slowly talk about his problems I think it would help"
WjOowWxOXCg,you are such a loving good step mom. i think seeking professional help for him asap as he is still young.
WjOowWxOXCg,Slowly build a trusting and loving relationship with him. Eventually I think he will open up to you and be happy to have you in his life... 💕 Best of luck !
WjOowWxOXCg,"Love him.. with a first u say &quot;i love u son,  bla bla..&quot;"
WjOowWxOXCg,Love him. Make sure he knows he is loved.
WjOowWxOXCg,I’m very sorry. You are with it. Hope you’re doing well
WjOowWxOXCg,"Bro parenting is something much more than that of just serving warm foods to kids.......just because a parent doesn&#39;t beat or scold their kids ,that doesn&#39;t make that parents great..."
WjOowWxOXCg,Same. I wonder if the neglect happened 0-2 years. My father telling my mother to just let me cry
WjOowWxOXCg,Sorry
WjOowWxOXCg,Why do people always feel the need to make everything at the internet or screen time. This has to do with attachment. <br><br>A healthy attachment with a parent can even be one who pays video games 24/7. Or bond over screen related activities. <br><br>Just because you go outside doesn&#39;t mean your attachment will be better. The parents could take them to the park and sit down then ignore the child.
WjOowWxOXCg,"it&#39;s not a competition sweetheart . if you&#39;re doing well, you work to make conditions better for everyone else."
WjOowWxOXCg,I feel proud for you even though i am not a parent but i wish they were much more parents just like you!
WjOowWxOXCg,you should be proud! parenting is difficult and it sounds like your daughter feels very safe with you!
WjOowWxOXCg,"I wish I had a mom like you, great on you for clicking on this video❤"
WjOowWxOXCg,"social studies...shoukd be about parenting, how to care for kids and even animals...some never got the memo...fkn sad"
WjOowWxOXCg,you have no frame of reference for &quot;good&quot; parenting...bad parenting feels normal...you marry what feels &quot; normal&quot;
WjOowWxOXCg,"@Erika I have ni word to say but sirry for the pain that your family is enduring.  I am just learning about residential schools and the impact they had on the Indigenous people  and I am overwhelmed with emotions, so I  can imagine how hard this must be. Peace be wurh you and your family."
WjOowWxOXCg,Thank you
WjOowWxOXCg,@Tina Gibbs I was a victim of a helicopter Mum in the US and I concur.
WjOowWxOXCg,"The factual problem with psychoanalysis is while you possibly get to recognize and face your problems and scars in a cognitive way, you&#39;ll probably not have the opportunity to get freed of the true feelings connected to these memory tracks. The deep frozen feelings are the true problem, making you a emotionally driven unit. CBT has in fact the same problem, and isn&#39;t even interested in your scarred past that much. It only teaches you to manage your life in a better way (which of course is a good thing), but leaves the weight of the past for you to carry on.<br><br>An emotionally addressed therapy would be the best, the idea being a bosom of a secure and caring &quot;parent&quot;, allowing you to feel all those frozen feelings away. That&#39;s why religion may function for a true believer, when surrendering yourself into the arms of a &quot;heavenly father&quot;. But it&#39;s quite possible to reach this feeling without any religion; it&#39;s even possible to be this caring adult to oneself. I think even psychotherapy may work this way at best, referring to the movie &quot;Good Will Hunting&quot;. Recommended if not already familiar."
WjOowWxOXCg,I’m so sorry and hope you’ll soon meet someone who loves you unconditionally.
WjOowWxOXCg,Yeah that makes sense. I feel like attachment theory is true to a certain extent but there’s definitely other things at play. I seem to have an anxious attachment style that can cross into avoidant at times but looking back I had a happy childhood and was honestly quite independent from a young age with certain things. Although I am a rly anxious person and I think it has a lot to do with me being my mum’s firstborn and so she was overly anxious and worried which I think rubbed off on me
WjOowWxOXCg,Aww that&#39;s heartwarming
WjOowWxOXCg,Aww I&#39;m so happy for you for growing so beautifully
WjOowWxOXCg,But it&#39;s also difficult to have emotions
WjOowWxOXCg,I Wish you well!
WjOowWxOXCg,"we&#39;re here for you, and we believe in you."

WjOowWxOXCg,i am sorry.
WjOowWxOXCg,@Kilamanjaro It sounds like you found what works best for your family and you know benefits the most from this? Your kids!
WjOowWxOXCg,"men-dads are just as important as the women-moms in the family. my husband is the stay at home dad. he is amazing with our children. he never gets a day off unlike me. I get 2 days off. he does most of the chores, homeschools, takes care of our small farm. we couldn&#39;t of been more blessed to have him in our lives."
WjOowWxOXCg,@Gabrielle Dennis Love any story about how something is working for a family
WjOowWxOXCg,I have friends in which the mom works and the dad stays at home. They made it work and they are great parents.
WjOowWxOXCg,@Cindy Mindy I hope you know I wasn&#39;t offended at all by this post talking about moms. I even pointed out that moms staying home and taking care of the kids is the most common. I was adding to the conversation that I have been a stay at home dad for 17 years and agree that it makes an impact on kids. It can be anyone who does it!
WjOowWxOXCg,@Coco by keeping everything to myself
WjOowWxOXCg,"@Coco , I don&#39;t think we can 😟"
WjOowWxOXCg,I wish I knew
WjOowWxOXCg,"Same, but like how do we reverse this? 💀💀"
WjOowWxOXCg,"@Claudia P The fact that you have to ask is a red flag. Marry a guy where it&#39;s all one pot, that you both have access to. Showing your independance attracts guys who can&#39;t be depended on."
WjOowWxOXCg,@Claudia P independent*
WjOowWxOXCg,"Nope, i prefer being Indipendent and not to ask even 10 dollars to my husband"
WjOowWxOXCg,"I think I was healing myself as well as raising my child when I SAH. I know I didn&#39;t want to put them into childcare even though I wanted a career. My own mother was working during my toddler hood. (my father was ill )so I was put with babysitters. When I got older I could step outside myself and see my needs and wants and hated it. I was all about my own child&#39;s mental wellness and though I was in a bad situation I always tried to express joy  or positivity to my child. I think it worked. They grew up more secure/more social/a better student than I was, even though I could be extremely outgoing."

WjOowWxOXCg,What steps are you taking for it?
WjOowWxOXCg,"Bullying at school isn&#39;t an issue. 30 years ago they used to throw rocks at the developmentally disabled. Now when someone doesn&#39;t like your Facebook post you start cutting. Stop blaming bullying, bullying is nothing like it was years ago"
WjOowWxOXCg,Facts don&#39;t care about your feelings
WjOowWxOXCg,"but sure, blame the parents I guess(!)"
WjOowWxOXCg,"I keep seeing a lot of these comments and I&#39;m not opposed to it, but where it should rrally be taught is by the  child&#39;s main caregiver. Because relying on schools to educate our children is part of the proble on this one. Not that they can&#39;t learn that way as the mature, taking these things back to the home life actually supports these theories."
WjOowWxOXCg,Have you tried therapy?
WjOowWxOXCg,Lmaoooooooo
WjOowWxOXCg,I can say that the chill shakes were the worse. No wonder i saw heaven. My little abused body WAS SHUTTING DOWN!
WjOowWxOXCg,It&#39;s a shame she couldn&#39;t even manage to get that right
WjOowWxOXCg,💐😞
WjOowWxOXCg,check the description
WjOowWxOXCg,Physical abuse isn&#39;t the only way that insecure attachment affects people
WjOowWxOXCg,It was 91%
WjOowWxOXCg,You know what needs to be done and you can do that!
WjOowWxOXCg,"Check our website to lesen how to share. If not for profit, go ahead!"
WjOowWxOXCg,"@Reveleur I never gave it much thought but that would make sense. I was frequently bullied as a kid, but only through first to third grade. I don&#39;t recall any friends during that time, or having a particularly great time on the playground. After that strange period my abnormal relationship patterns did begin. Thanks for the insight. ^^"
WjOowWxOXCg,Wow. You just described me...
WjOowWxOXCg,"@Rosa Curci Agreed, we should use our advantage to help others who need it, thank you! 💗"
WjOowWxOXCg,"Same💓we&#39;re pretty lucky tbh,I&#39;ve  always felt so guilty for being so lucky,but right now I&#39;ve learned to try and help people that have been not as lucky as me as much as I can instead of just feeling guilty about it^_^👍💘"
WjOowWxOXCg,"We&#39;re all creatures of our past experiences, it can be early trauma or recent trauma, it isn&#39;t something fixed but usually the worst cases are due to childhood troubles"
WjOowWxOXCg,@Sprouts Thank you ❤️
WjOowWxOXCg,"You gave all you could, and that’s what counts. One day she’ll probably find peace with her story and can make peace with you. Till then try to stay strong! 🙏"
WjOowWxOXCg,That’s sad. He probably had a terrible dad or mom himself. Go ask him about the time when he was 3 or 4!
WjOowWxOXCg,"Yes, I&#39;ve thought the same..."
WjOowWxOXCg,True. On top of that u have theharsh outside world unkind authority figures who tear u apart inside :)
WjOowWxOXCg,"It&#39;s not her fault. She doesn&#39;t understand mommy is tired. She just wants a hug and to be played with...at nap time and night time, she wants to feel safe and comfortable. She wants to go to sleep at her own pace. It&#39;s not her fault"
WjOowWxOXCg,Absolutely
WjOowWxOXCg,"To people who say this is impossible, I understand that healing is a lifelong process but I at least hope that aspiring parents will learn first to be self-aware, to reflect on how their actions affect others. They can also try adopting a pet first, it&#39;s a good practice of responsibility. Parenting styles often appear when you get a pet, and pets can really test you."
WjOowWxOXCg,@Wendy Whoisit Yes and no. All relative. It&#39;s more about meeting the right person. Leave it til later and people get set in their ways and aren&#39;t flexible enough to adjust to babies and children.
WjOowWxOXCg,@rrrrrr that’s a different situation. For adoption this thought is totally true. Obviously if you have trauma from pregnancy or birth; probably important to deal w that trauma in therapy ASAP.
WjOowWxOXCg,So true.
WjOowWxOXCg,thank you!

WjOowWxOXCg,"Eye contact is cultural. As a child of European parents, if I looked them in the eye when they yelled at me that would be considered disrespectful. <br><br>You can&#39;t believe everything a shrink says...sorry."
WjOowWxOXCg,When my dad would beat us he would lecture us first and make us lock eyes with him.
WjOowWxOXCg,But why some fathers don&#39;t talk to their children? Sooo many Whys in my head right now 🤯
WjOowWxOXCg,"I swear and not just that, if you take all the time I&#39;ve actually talked to him it&#39;d be less than 2 days all combined and i am 15..so this hurts.  My mom on the other hand expresses love but zero support like ZERO support. I was googling salaries and found out that catering had a lot of money in it and i told that to my mom, and she yelled at me and scolded me full 30 minutes saying &quot; i am not teaching you to be in catering you ungrateful child&quot;...and god i was mad but what can a 15 year old possibly do right?"
WjOowWxOXCg,"Kallista I&#39;m 22 and still can&#39;t look my dad in the eyes, I&#39;m terrified of him and avoid beeing in the same room as him at all costs..."
WjOowWxOXCg,I agree and respect this comment.
WjOowWxOXCg,"&quot;Wanting, desiring kids is not good enough&quot; Man, one of the realest things I&#39;ve read! And yes, now at 40 with a 1 yr old after raising a 21 yr old solo, my life feels miserable"
WjOowWxOXCg,"I can definitely respect your words, feelings and insight."
WjOowWxOXCg,Yes. U are right.. :) my dad&#39;s mom was extremely abusive so were his brothers to him.. so he turned out to be a very angry person with complexity.. my mom&#39;s dad was hard on her too so she became like that too.. however it stops with me .. I&#39;ll never be that to my children that&#39;s why im not having children until im ok mentally
WjOowWxOXCg,I’m currently pregnant and im watching this to understand why my parents were they way they were and to not be like them for my children
WjOowWxOXCg,@NetraI second that
WjOowWxOXCg,@Brooke S teens are like that. They want a chance to practice young adulthood and all the things you taught them...making decisions
WjOowWxOXCg,@Happy Emoji I would hope so! That means there is some hope of finding out what happened in their situation with their children. To understand and try healing with their children.
WjOowWxOXCg,I AM!

WjOowWxOXCg,"this is so typical in the philippines. Maids are considered cheap so anyone can hire them and most of the time, once a child is born, there&#39;s always a maid and all day the maid takes care of the child while parents workss."
WjOowWxOXCg,"@Tamlyn Adolph  <br>But, some people have nannies when only the husband works. The moms go shopping or travel with friends, not caring they left their kids behind.<br>My mom is a nanny, and she works for people who only the husband works with a really great income. The mom&#39;s don&#39;t even do anything since they also have a cleaning lady and they still don&#39;t make time for their children instead the go out with their friends like why have kids just to be raise by someone else."
WjOowWxOXCg,"@Alaunna Tingle well said just learnt this im my child development class. Anyone can care and love for a child,and if you can&#39;t it says quite alot about you as a human being."
WjOowWxOXCg,I fet the same way..altho i do not own a company but i work in a competitive field i felt me being a mom was a burden to my career..and i seem to be the only one struggling to keep it all together.. but looking at this i realized how important it is to spend time with my kid..
WjOowWxOXCg,"We all have different life Situations and can only do best with what life throws our way. Keeping these studies ans theories in mind when trying to decide the best way to help your child can be very very important. Our current society promotes a both parent working household despite the issues it will put on the children. Life scenarios can&#39;t be helped but even just trying to implement a little bit of time with our kids that is directly for them can make a major difference. I&#39;ve had to change my parenting styles for each child as they all required different things to make them feel loved, and none of them match mine. Its a struggle but that one extra hug, that focused listening on your 2 year old gibberish about colors and balls and the things he thinks are funny&#39; working as a family unit to overcome problems, these things really help. Even if they aren&#39;t the constant norm"
WjOowWxOXCg,"This is exactly what my mother used to say and continues to do so. Now I am a mother too and I weigh each and every word that comes out of my mouth when I am speaking with my kid even if I am under immense pressure or frustrated, so that I dont turn just like my hurtful mother. I haven&#39;t healed completely but everyday I remind myself that my kid is not my punching bag to vent out my insecurities and frustration. The result, my kid loves me to moon and back and ensures that she communicates this to me over a dozen times in a day."
WjOowWxOXCg,"@Phenita Gomes when my parents are old enough, I&#39;m leaving them on the side of the road. Let the state take care of them."
WjOowWxOXCg,{{HUG}}.
WjOowWxOXCg,I also had similar childhood. I used to feel awkward when people would be happy. But then it’s recently I realised  that Everyone has issues! Have faith in almighty.. and try to love everyone you meet now. Things should improve 🤗<br>Lots of love
WjOowWxOXCg,hello malavika. i did the same with my boyfreind. and then afterwards I had a conversation with him and opened up big time about my childhood and all that stuff so he knew where I was coming from and we got back together and working slowly together as I try to better myself until I can get therapy. but for now I&#39;m just taking it one step at a time. we have also discussed in relation to kids... that we both want but to will not happen until I have addressed my childhood trauma so I wont unknowingly inflict it on my kids. same for our possible marriage. i wish u the best in your life and continued progress without without a partner. <br>also... word of advice concerning partners ---- if they belittle or do not acknowledge your childhood trauma its not worth it. there is no need to rush for a partner. focus on ourself and if it comes it comes. &lt;333333 <br><br>p.s take to mind wat i said about kids .... while yes u may acknowledge what ur parents did and try not to do it for them they may be some unwilling / unknown times u may do likewise. so do address your childhood trauma before / if u decide to have kids.
WjOowWxOXCg,"@*Camuz* Bueno, no se cuál ha sido tu experiencia de vida. Yo no quería sufrir lo que sufrió mi madre ni que mis hijos  sufrieran lo que sufrí yo."
WjOowWxOXCg,<b>No te lo puedo creer... Yo sí quería hijos ☺️ bien deseados que económicamente pudiera educarlos el techo el alimento la compañía el amor y el ejemplo y todo se me dio primero estudie trabaje ahorre y Ya adulta logre mi hijo mayor y muy adulta mi hijo menor los amo!</b>

Yo quedé fría😭😭😭 la corrupción tan terrible de esos padres!</b>
WjOowWxOXCg,That explains so much of my own experience!!!
WjOowWxOXCg,"I&#39;m just gonna be honest, I don&#39;t know what that means , lol 😅"
WjOowWxOXCg,@Deb S I&#39;m so sorry to hear that. No father should hate their child.
WjOowWxOXCg,@Deb S they always only blame the mother. That’s the patriarchy/misogyny for you
WjOowWxOXCg,"Don&#39;t just blame mother&#39;s.  My father HATED me. My mom desperately did everything to earn his approval, so I was shoved aside, ignored, blamed for everything. Fathers are guilty of babies being ignored too."
WjOowWxOXCg,"@NJ Rom hi, thanks for replying. I recently have moved on, feeling better than before."
WjOowWxOXCg,It’s because it’s your choice if you let your self be affected by the bad things or choose to move on stay strong and be positive
WjOowWxOXCg,be true to yourself- that is all that you need to do &lt;3
WjOowWxOXCg,"no one is invisible, i was emotionally neglected as well, especially in my teens. hoping for the best..."
WjOowWxOXCg,Thanks for sharing your thoughts. Very insightful 🙏
WjOowWxOXCg,And no it should not be compulsory ya fascist. Especially more than once. How utterly condescending.
WjOowWxOXCg,@Montesa Wow what a completely fucked up take
WjOowWxOXCg,"Foster parents need this, as well as mental health screenings…"
WjOowWxOXCg,@Kellie Griffin by parenting I don&#39;t just mean the obvious bits but even psychological nuances as well as other things

WjOowWxOXCg,@Evan Amo i didnt knew the character  had name in the video
WjOowWxOXCg,"@a grasshopper wasn&#39;t that the father&#39;s name? I could be wrong. Either way, I&#39;m expressing my dismay about someone getting sick and dying in a single day."
WjOowWxOXCg,Who tf is mr smith
WjOowWxOXCg,I see your point. Telling them you hate them isn&#39;t helpful at all. It&#39;s not said to correct or bring change just to hurt like they hurt you. I think if they are that bad go no contact but don&#39;t say it&#39;s all there fault. That can really screw up a parent (even though it&#39;s true) and if they tried to be good it can make them depressed or worse.
WjOowWxOXCg,@ハムスターの日常 LOL ...yeah. 😂😂🤣🤣
WjOowWxOXCg,@Jack Rufus Your welcome. I&#39;m no shrink and people can have traits of it without having full blown NPD but glad to help. I have to be careful since I&#39;m not a doctor or shrink. However I am pretty sure a family member has NPD and it&#39;s not cool. However the more I learn about how it developed the easier it to understand. <br>If they do have it you will feel like they are being a child in a temper tantrum. The best think to do is be careful what ammo you give them. Don&#39;t complain about things to them. They will act supportive but bring that up at a later date to use as ammo. <br>Worse part is they typically don&#39;t try to address it.....even if they realize they have an issue. Take care glad I could help!
WjOowWxOXCg,@Ralf Washington thanks ...! I was looking for the exact term .I looked into it ... I wasn&#39;t aware of this Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD). Its exactly what my brother has.
WjOowWxOXCg,True. Sounds like he is possibly narcissistic or has those traits (which do forum from early childhood)
WjOowWxOXCg,Wallah me too
WjOowWxOXCg,So you dont have a family Man.
WjOowWxOXCg,"Good news. We get to choose our family. Bloodline not necessary. It took me a long, long time to &quot;get&quot; that. Glad I did because my sister&#39;s and brothers from other mothers are the best family I could have hoped for growing up."
WjOowWxOXCg,🥰 sending you love!
WjOowWxOXCg,😔 👋
WjOowWxOXCg,😢
WjOowWxOXCg,Unfortunately yes
WjOowWxOXCg,Sad. They must have had a sad childhood themselves. Try to break the circle!
WjOowWxOXCg,My mom and sister always blame me for all of the misfortune even if they are very unrelated to me
WjOowWxOXCg,"@Joshua Saragih You’re NOT useless. <br>Parents do not own their children. They were only lent to them by the Creator and they are their own being. Everyone of us is beautiful for just existing, just like trees and  Nature. We don’t have to please people or be useful to THEM to find ourselves worthy. Keep finding yourself and keep growing Joshua. Talk to your inner kid whenever it’s sad or happy and enjoy your own company before you enjoy that of others."
WjOowWxOXCg,My mom stressed because there’s nothing she can be proud of me
WjOowWxOXCg,"Eventhough I&#39;ve done what she asked me to do eventually she&#39;ll say the same thing, &quot;you&#39;re useless and never did anything&quot;, my youth was very misarable and I hated my mom and I didnt know why.<br>I&#39;m pretty good at art and I said I want to be an artist and my mom kept saying its a useless subject, its just a hobby and go get a real thing to do.<br>Now I feel very useless, I want to get rid off this feeling, I&#39;ve read a lot of books and watched a lot og videos, its nice to hear other people&#39;s experiences and feeling, I dont feel alone and I dont feel that I&#39;m weird like my mom told me."
WjOowWxOXCg,Same. One primary caregiver is fine ❤️
WjOowWxOXCg,Never apologise for your wording in English... you should be very happy of yourself to be able to speak 2 different languages 😊 💙👌🏻
WjOowWxOXCg,@Rafe Not all people are gringos. Most of the world are filled with other cultures and languages. Like me. I appreciated what you said to Amanda though. My mother tongue is Afrikaans. Ja Rafael ek waardeer jou woorde
WjOowWxOXCg,hola Amanda. Siento tu dolor.  usted no está solo.
WjOowWxOXCg,"Que coisa Amanda, espero que você consiga superar isso algum dia...e n precisa falar inglês necessariamente n, esses gringos não fazem isso por nós."
WjOowWxOXCg,"Hi Amanda, I am sorry to hear that. It is great thought that you are aware of your emotions and of their root. Being able to look at the difficult things we go through in life is an important first step in healing. Wishing you all the best!"

WjOowWxOXCg,@Sprouts Thank you so much for that... I&#39;ll talk to my sister about that 💕💕
WjOowWxOXCg,Maybe. Given that you are just 13 you are remarkably bright and reflective. Maybe you can try talking to your older sister more. And try not to put your moms personal life problems to serious. She’s sounds like a sad woman saying things like that. Try not be too much affected by her issues. If that’s possible... good luck 🤞🌱
WjOowWxOXCg,Thanks for sharing 🙏 Genes and randomness still play a big role in how we go through life. I’m wishing all the for her!
WjOowWxOXCg,OMAG!!! I hope she has nightmares for the rest of her life

WjOowWxOXCg,"@catch- 2022 According to the most recent census, 14% of the UK population is non-white. Fortunately, where I live ( London) that proportion is far greater. You are either living in a very remote part of the UK. Or, more likely, you are living in the past."
WjOowWxOXCg,That&#39;s your issue? Great Britain happens to be a place full of white people. Maybe watch a Venezualen video.
WjOowWxOXCg,@Narayan Swamy thx
WjOowWxOXCg,No its asking us to fix our inner self so we will be truly useful to it.
WjOowWxOXCg,I disagree

WjOowWxOXCg,OMG! HER NAME IS ANA! THIS IS NO COINCIDENCE! THIS IS REALLY A MONSTER REFERENCE!
WjOowWxOXCg,"Drugs, alcohol, short lived relationships seems to work for me."
WjOowWxOXCg,i know right? i already know that i&#39;m kinda messed up since i have an emotionally unavailable dad but i really don&#39;t know how to improve myself. these videos just make us feel worse about our problems.
WjOowWxOXCg,"There will be a new generation....we need to feel it up with as many strong, centered, adults as we can ."
WjOowWxOXCg,Then you heard what you wanted.....bringing a child in to the world and covering it from the screwed up mind set of  society....well that would be the most bad ass thing you can do
WjOowWxOXCg,"Fathers? Oh Yes, that would be amazing! I was just referring to my experience as I spent a lot more time with my children as their dad does.<br>But yes, you&#39;re absolutely right!"
WjOowWxOXCg,And fathers? Blah
WjOowWxOXCg,"And fathers,  pressure and responsibility always seems to fall on the mum and alot of dad&#39;s can just walk away"
WjOowWxOXCg,"Worse if they think of you as a tool to get their dream they failed to achieve. &quot;I only want you to get this job&quot; or &quot;Getting your master is useless, 9-5 is the best&quot;. Then they expect your salary for them only. That&#39;s tiring tbh"
WjOowWxOXCg,@Vengeful Polititron You can work on your issues and little by little regain your authentic self and heal your wounds.  ACA/DF and CoDA have been helpful for me.  Find a good therapist if you can.
WjOowWxOXCg,"@Mitzi73 you are a survivor, never forget that"
WjOowWxOXCg,I was a victim of this.  I almost 50 and I have had to separate from my mother as much as I can just so I can find myself and be an adult.

WjOowWxOXCg,That&#39;s a great idea. I&#39;m glad you&#39;re working on yourself and bettering yourself. It takes strength to do that. How have u been doing now tho
WjOowWxOXCg,Ahhh I can’t relate moree😂🥲
WjOowWxOXCg,"So relatable, but I&#39;m Marxist"
WjOowWxOXCg,"@palm tree well maybe I&#39;m just a bit too melodramatic, but sometimes I feel just too messed up in every aspect of my life and don&#39;t know where to start, plus I feel too tired to do anything"
WjOowWxOXCg,And what about the people who don&#39;t want children in the future? That would be a pointless subject
WjOowWxOXCg,"As controlled by Republicans and/or Christians?  No thank you!  &quot;Spare the rod and spoil the child&quot; is what would likely be taught.  I don&#39;t know the answer, but everything put into the classroom is likely to turn to sh!t."
WjOowWxOXCg,Can u not
WjOowWxOXCg,"@Emily Thomson in our country, that&#39;s just cooking, sewing, stuff like that."
WjOowWxOXCg,Same.
WjOowWxOXCg,"That’s the beauty of children. You think you’re there to teach them but, if the intent in genuine, they end up teaching you so much more."
WjOowWxOXCg,"That is because we are all children. Just old children, still trying to make sense of our complex early lives."
WjOowWxOXCg,Amazing feeling to find your thoughts being reflected in another&#39;s words.
WjOowWxOXCg,"@K. Hines you are actually a great parent for actually giving some time from your life into learning and becoming a better parent, most parents don&#39;t even bother to watch and learn about parenting and get over with the &quot;these are for those who will have children soon&quot;, &quot;parents always know the best and do the best for their children&quot; and &quot;these are just biased things to make our children brats and create distance from us&quot; mentality and children will watch them and learn to become better parents in future"
WjOowWxOXCg,@palm tree I do! But it is a process.
WjOowWxOXCg,How&#39;s it going?
WjOowWxOXCg,@Grey Green  i strongly disagree! most of the time we learn from other people’s mistakes
WjOowWxOXCg,"no, you will form the same connection that your parents and the environment taught you, you will repeat their scenario."

WjOowWxOXCg,It&#39;s great that you are interested in this kind of videos. I think you&#39;ll be a great and loving mum. I wish you all the happiness in the world with your son!
WjOowWxOXCg,Replace dad with mom same shit
WjOowWxOXCg,"My dad is a narcissist, he controls, manipulates. Mentally and emotionally abuses me.. I know how you feel, he never sexually abused me.. but he does abuse me still does it now."
WjOowWxOXCg,"Me too, what a blessing."
WjOowWxOXCg,"Same here. ।thats why I always fight for secure partner, secure parents, secure family topic. Bcoz we know how much it&#39;s important for children."
WjOowWxOXCg,"In this instant, of course, the word &quot;God&quot; being directly substituted for the word &quot;luck&quot;"

WjOowWxOXCg,Nah man. That would mean we should feel bad for incels.
WjOowWxOXCg,@D Bbj may i know who is your dr? my husband needs help.
WjOowWxOXCg,@A R If you read his upgringing you&#39;d know
WjOowWxOXCg,@x his father? Not his mother ?<br>( I see you are so normal)
WjOowWxOXCg,@NJ Rom Seriously? Take your judgements and misogyny elsewhere.
WjOowWxOXCg,"@T Breadner absolutely agree with you. This person doesn&#39;t know what they&#39;re talking about. I have PPD and other mental health issues despite being married and having the typical &#39;nuclear family&#39;, and that doesn&#39;t mean s----. It is awful to generalize."
WjOowWxOXCg,"@NJ Rom ´do you have a husband or are you &lt;just&gt; a baby momma ‘. I would throat punch someone who had the nerve to judge my marital status because I had a baby. Female humans only need one thing from males when becoming a Mother. everything else is just female humans sharing the gift of a baby with male humans. Providing for that baby and supporting the woman that gave you that baby is a privilege to a good man. We are not in anyway lessened by the absence of a male,  nor are families of varying structures who love their children less than a traditional ´Mom and Pop and a couple of kids ‘ nuclear family."
WjOowWxOXCg,Did u got your pregnancy unplanned or was your pregnancy planned? Do you have a husband or are u just a baby momma.?  Can he provide ? are u ready to be a mom? Do you have a home? How is your relationship? Those things can contribute to your post partum depression.  A planned baby and a secure marriage and job can reduce or  prevent depression. But if your pregnancy is unplanned and you don’t have a good relationship with your family or husband/lover . You’ll definitely be depressed because you would worry about you and your sons future .

Remember, we are actually really really good at this. Now, I&#39;m all for finding new studies that may help any child farther a long, but most of this had little to dk with you and how hard you have to work because this party&#39;s easy. Make time, communicate....I personally am not a hugger, I have to push past that for 2 of my kids because they required that physical cuddles and affection. I&#39;m not great still bit we have spoken about it. They know. And we do things to get a round it. Kids are easy. What&#39;s difficult is the providing for what you think they deserve and still having time for them balance is key"
WjOowWxOXCg,spare the crocodiles bud. Everything is hard if you are weak. Parenting isn&#39;t hard. Most people are unprepared to be parents before they have kids. Hence the large number of degenerates in society.
WjOowWxOXCg,Me too
WjOowWxOXCg,watching this while having a breakdown didnt help
WjOowWxOXCg,All of us felt the same
WjOowWxOXCg,yeah :&#39;(...
WjOowWxOXCg,Good luck! You can!
WjOowWxOXCg,"@rosie ♡♤ yes, but how?"
WjOowWxOXCg,"Her daughter is still very young, she could still fix her relationship with her"
WjOowWxOXCg,"Ps: I’ve been reading this last night and thought of your comment:<br><br><a href=""https://www.economist.com/obituary/2020/09/19/joan-feynman-died-on-july-22nd"">https://www.economist.com/obituary/2020/09/19/joan-feynman-died-on-july-22nd</a>"
WjOowWxOXCg,Noted. We feel with you and ensure to bring more balance into our future productions. Thanks for the reminder!
WjOowWxOXCg,I don&#39;t have any much close friends either. I feel so alone
WjOowWxOXCg,@Zedscopy glad to hear this but i wouldn&#39;t wish this upon anyone 🤧
WjOowWxOXCg,@i couldn&#39;t think of any name so basically I&#39;m not alone
WjOowWxOXCg,same here with me i grew up without a mom and my dad&#39;s new wife would treat me great in front of others but when they aren&#39;t around she will treat me like iam nothing and my opinions didn&#39;t mattered and so i grew with up having trouble with sharing my feelings everytime i shared i always feel bad for sharing my feelings and a close friend of mine always comment bad stuff about me soo i sometimes feel numb like a robot nobody to share my thoughts and even if shared i feel bad for sharing...lol 😅
WjOowWxOXCg,"@Nediana🌱 it actually hurts when people you &quot;love&quot; or supposed to love you end up backstabbing you,and say u are extraordinary or different, just because you hyperreact to situations,which is due to trauma from past."

WjOowWxOXCg,"@la geena same , my daughter is about to be 9 now and we’re making changes .. slowly but surely . I know I’m 9 years late but hoping I can help change something idk 🤷🏻‍♀️ 🤦🏻‍♀️"
WjOowWxOXCg,"I know this is late but I want to say that this resonates with me as a young mom with severe mental health issues, including postpartum depression. I feel like I have failed my child to the core. I am seeking therapy but feel like the damage has already been done. It&#39;s so hard to heal when you&#39;re a parent trying to raise a whole another human being."
WjOowWxOXCg,🥺
WjOowWxOXCg,"Same, my dad is quite strict, but i can be more-or-less open with my mom"
WjOowWxOXCg,Omg same case happened with me!
WjOowWxOXCg,Then who is going to evaluate the government to make sure they are competent?
WjOowWxOXCg,"Treat everyone with patience, compassion, forgiveness, and love."
WjOowWxOXCg,"I so envy you.. i really wanna talk about personal life to my parents and make them like my first friends but i cant because my mom is soo overthinking person, my dad.. he will always give advice as much as possible in every situation altho i didnt ask for it and only wanna share the story of the day, like bruh.. please dont make everything seems in serious mode, it made me re-think if i wanna tell something to my parents, unless it’s very important i rather not"
WjOowWxOXCg,"@Some one that is so sad way of viewing the world. it all up to you in the ending and i will live with hope, love and confidence in myself than being passmetic."
WjOowWxOXCg,"It&#39;s good that you want to be a good mum (mother?) someday, but it&#39;s likely you won&#39;t be; there are far to many people messing with you, which will turn your good intentions into mistakes and harm.  If we could figure out how to stop child abuse and agree on what child abuse all includes, then maybe we would all have a chance at a good decent life.  But nobody nor any group is showing the world they are even working on the fundamental problems negatively impacting humanity during childhood and almost always getting worse into adulthood.   You can&#39;t just follow someones so-called answers, you have to be able to figure out what&#39;s real, true, logical, reasonable, good, and unharmful for yourself and find others who agree and work to improve.  Nobody has the answers, not even me, but I got a good idea and I desperately need to find others who also have a good idea of what&#39;s going wrong and why and trying different ways to treat others without offence nor harm."
WjOowWxOXCg,"Sprouts Sorry for the delay. I hope you are healthy and safe in this time of COVID.<br>Bushman, B. J., Baumeister, R. F., &amp; Stack, A. D. (1999). Catharsis, aggression, and persuasive influence: Self-fulfilling or self-defeating prophecies? Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 76, 367-376.<br>Geen, R. G., &amp; Quanty, M. B. (1977). The catharsis of aggression: An evaluation of a hypothesis. In L. Berkowitz (Ed.), Advances in experimental social psychology (Vol. 10, pp. 1-37). New York: Academic Press."
WjOowWxOXCg,I’ll look into that. Any good resources / research on catharsis you’d recommend? Note that I did do the process. Further note that I now added a disclaimer below the video.
WjOowWxOXCg,I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a very nice description of attachment theory; it changed from being presented as theory to brainwashing very quickly.  But I guess you wouldn&#39;t notice it because you obviously can&#39;t just speak for yourself in your very first sentence.
WjOowWxOXCg,"No, not my personal experience. But, unlike CBT for example, there is no research to support it, only testimonials. The folks involved in EST and Landmark, as other intense catharsis oriented approaches, provide very intense experiences, but no followup data on how it actually worked beyond testimonials. We do know from studies that catharsis does not work, and can have very damaging results, including worsening the very issues it was meant to help."
WjOowWxOXCg,Was that your experience?
WjOowWxOXCg,"Some one  I’ve actually seen huge improvements with my son’s behaviors and communication so you telling me this doesn’t add up. You can heal from trauma. You have a negative mindset to think no one will ever change for the better. I get what you’re trying to tell me tho. You don’t know me and you don’t see how I take care of my son. You’re only assuming. If you want to get through someone be more nicer and words things out differently. No need to be an ass and cuss to get to your point across. Be a decent human being. I’m not going to take advice from someone who can’t even communicate well with others. You’re trying to teach me how to be a better parent when you yourself can’t even communicate properly. That’s a huge issue a lot of kids with abusive, toxic parents lack in. I won’t be replying back to you anymore because this will obviously be a loop. I’m not feeding into that. Thank you for sharing your opinion tho."
WjOowWxOXCg,Some one I’m constantly growing and learning and there’s nothing I love more than learning and improving as I grow. Maybe your definition of independent is different than mine but I am currently happy and stable and that to me is independent. If my son calls me out on something I’m doing wrong then I will listen to him. It’s wrong to invalidate any child’s opinion. I don’t believe in putting down a child’s opinion down and not letting him think for himself. Sounds like you really need some healing if you’re reading comments and replying with negativity. I hope you heal and understand that everyone is different.
WjOowWxOXCg,"I think it&#39;s all a shit show until at least some of us can come to an agreement of what child abuse entails, create legislation to abolish child abuse, figure out how to get people to wake the fk up without making thigs worse, change people in governments failing young children, and do so as well within the courts, school teachers, police, medical field, and social sciences."
WjOowWxOXCg,"Oh heck yes, exactly. I was never allowed my emotions. Happiness was mocked. Anxiety was denied. The family scorecard? Father left. Middle brother began his alcoholic career at age 10. Youngest brother took his own life age 40. I moved 2200 miles away at age 30, primarily to lessen her impact. Therapy, antidepressants, analysis gave me sporadic years of luving as a healthy person. Not now."
WjOowWxOXCg,yeah they say that :(
WjOowWxOXCg,"of course not grateful, think first about your mother and then about yourself, analyze the conditions in which she grew up and lived, what she did for you and what it cost her, and you will have to cope with your depression on your own, because your mother did not cope with her depression."
WjOowWxOXCg,We&#39;re in the same boat
WjOowWxOXCg,Same
WjOowWxOXCg,Yep so don&#39;t have kids
WjOowWxOXCg,"Let&#39;s protect them! Please, they need us"
WjOowWxOXCg,children aren&#39;t special.
WjOowWxOXCg,"I know, right?😭"
WjOowWxOXCg,Ugh yessd
WjOowWxOXCg,my theory is that everyone has their time of fame sometime in their life<br>perhaps yours hasn&#39;t come yet<br><br><br><br><br>don&#39;t give up hope brother
WjOowWxOXCg,I caught that too. 😦 It was sad honestly.
WjOowWxOXCg,"I actually remember my first day of school. I was walked to school without being explained what school was. I remember thinking it was my new home. I remember knowing about orphanages and thinking this is where I was being left. <br>I cried my heart out begging for them not to leave me. &quot;I&#39;ll clean my toys,&quot; I said. as the teacher and my father pried me from his leg. <br>the situation was never explained to me, I felt so abandoned."
WjOowWxOXCg,"@presmokan So agree, being compassionate to whoever they are makes us understand what  battling them inside."
WjOowWxOXCg,Same.
WjOowWxOXCg,@HypieTV correct
WjOowWxOXCg,Not all of them are victims though ://<br>They are also giving people trouble in their lives so why should i reflect on them?
WjOowWxOXCg,Father forgive them they know not wat they do in Jesus name Amen💜
WjOowWxOXCg,"I hope you took her seriously and got out, never to  return. Once you cut off contact with her, you can begin to heal."
WjOowWxOXCg,I&#39;m happy for you &lt;3
WjOowWxOXCg,I am so happy for you but I also envy you.
WjOowWxOXCg,"Not necessarily, it really depends on each situation, and personality too."
WjOowWxOXCg,You&#39;re welcome! :)
WjOowWxOXCg,@Paula Taillant yes after my mom died. my mom sister took care of me
WjOowWxOXCg,"So sorry for your loss . It must have been difficult for you to grow up without her , especially if you had a loving , positive relationship. <br>In your adult life do you have an aunt or anyone in the family or outside of the family that is in that maternal role ? It can be healing to have someone in your life in that role ."
WjOowWxOXCg,@Lauren thanks
WjOowWxOXCg,I was the same. But I met someone who was extremely patient with me. Sometimes I still have moments of worries with his tone or if he&#39;s sad and he always gives me the space to express that. You need to find someone who will put in the patience with you because they love you. That&#39;s the relationship that&#39;ll be worth it :)
WjOowWxOXCg,"Girl here and same, I&#39;m somewhat good looking so I get male attention often but that doesn&#39;t mean anything because I&#39;m unable to form meaningful relationships with people"
WjOowWxOXCg,Me too man u not alone
WjOowWxOXCg,i dont remember posting this comment
WjOowWxOXCg,If you were bonding with your grandma that’s fine too. The mom or another primary caregiver are essential - according to the theory
WjOowWxOXCg,"the world is cruel and for kids seems ok from the outside. Death, the earth being destroyed from corrupted point of views people only climbing the ranks for power and happiness, sacrificing people&#39;s lives who dont matter. <br>&quot;We all die.

WjOowWxOXCg,Good luck 🙏🏻
WjOowWxOXCg,Me too so quiet and obedient...... and forced to behave like matured when i was a baby...... no tandrums... nothing...i try my level best to be quiet and not to make any problems to my parents as they always busy with their work.....bt now as an young adult now people try to misuse my obedience 😔😔 and i don&#39;t know what to do..... i am having trust issues and it makes hard for me to make keep friendship and create bond with people..... i am working on these now.... trying to fix myself... <br><br><br><br>Sorry for bad english ❣️

WjOowWxOXCg,you are a human &lt;333333
WjOowWxOXCg,You too may have trust issues
WjOowWxOXCg,We are so focused on casting away the outdated stuff only to also throw away important stuff too...
WjOowWxOXCg,start planning your escape. You won&#39;t be a child forever.
WjOowWxOXCg,@knightmare Wish you the best too ❤️
WjOowWxOXCg,"I feel you. My parents are never really there to hear me out. They always tell me that what I’m doing isn’t good enough and that I need to be the best. I’ve never been that good at math, but they sort of forced me to become one of the top of the class if that makes sense. I don’t really remember too much from elementary school (I’ve gotten a few brain injuries that have caused me to lose many memories) but I do remember my dad yelling at me every night because I couldn’t understand my math homework. I threw myself into studying and forced myself to become the best in middle school. My dad always made me feel that if I wasn’t the best then I was worthless, so I forced myself to change. Now I’m in high school and I’m in all honors classes. Honors math is way too hard for me, but I still try to force myself to get the best possible grades. That math class has made me learn that it’s okay to fail a test every once in a while. I was so stressed out that I forgot that I don’t NEED to be the best. I only WANT to be the best. Grades don’t matter as much as mental health. Just remember that💜 I hope things get better for you"
WjOowWxOXCg,I hope you good and healing. That&#39;s just heartbreaking to hear. It&#39;s not easy and I salute you for not giving up. All my best wishes. ❤
WjOowWxOXCg,"I applaud you for being so smart to recognize the unhealthy people in your life at such an early age and start healing. I am so sorry for anyone that has been through abuse, it breaks my heart that you were hurt. I started asking myself what role did I play for the things that happened in my life, especially at an early age. I gave it my best and always tried to be and do perfect, knowing that no one is. I know now that we have the choice to become better and more compassionate. I want to always be able to know that answer within myself. We will never be the victim because we can see and feel so clearly what has happened. Our biggest lessons come from going through some horrific pain. <br>I know you are/will be an amazing person that will accomplish great things in your life. I send you much love and many blessings on your journey through life surrounded by people who know true love. May all your dreams come true❣️"
WjOowWxOXCg,Can I say that Jesus Christ loves you with a love that is from everlasting to everlasting Amen💜
WjOowWxOXCg,@Thales Oliveira no what&#39;s that?
WjOowWxOXCg,@Farah Kara you&#39;ll be loved ;) have you heard of dbt?
WjOowWxOXCg,It is vital to help at infancy.
WjOowWxOXCg,"That assumes that parents have themselves been raised to have reasonably secure attachment. The <b>opportunity</b> for bonding may exist if a parent stays home, but without an understanding of what an infant and toddler needs, as well as and the emotional stability to follow through, it doesn&#39;t do much good."
WjOowWxOXCg,A year is enough to make the parents get used to getting money for their work. If they don’t get money anymore at some point the quality of parenting will drop
WjOowWxOXCg,"Lmfao sounds great.<br>Imagine being the employer, and having to hire women in their 20&#39;s, and being forced to pay for a worker that doesnt even work. <br><br>This isnt Norway. Government doesnt have a massive oil reserve where they can just hand out money to people.<br>Also imagine how easily abusable that would be. People already abuse employment benefits in the states, and refuse to get a job untill it ends. With that type of person being standard, imagine how well this gonna work in america"

WjOowWxOXCg,Really once remember my dad finally took us to haunted house but not before making a stop to every friend of his along the way what started out as 30 min ride turned into 8hrs stay here in the car ill be right back an hr later or so gotta make another stop stay in car finally made it to haunted house where my cuz who was maybe 4 mighta been 5 after being locked in car and told to stay put because dads friends were more important  had an accident in the the car in his britches to be more accurate dad came back to the car berated him and the rest of us as trash (nicely) and instead of getting a change of clothes for my cuz from his friends or goodwill anywhere he made my cuz strip down to put a diaper on him and placed soiled clothes in paper bag and carry it with us thru haunted house the whole time making comments like i bet that scared the shit outta ya. I dont remember any of the monsters from the house only the one pushing us along antagonizing the whole time laughing at the torment and suffering from his narcissistic and sadistic brain  thats just one story from any given day that asshole should regret instead regrets leaving some whore he qnd a buddy had their way with and ended up leaving her in the middle of the everglades  not that she was any less but we were his family and always gave his time to be somewhere else unless he could torture us as kids but rolls change when we got older now we have nothing to do with him or very rarely and talk even by phone more rarely
WjOowWxOXCg,You&#39;ll get through it stay strong
WjOowWxOXCg,This is so nice to hear ❤️
WjOowWxOXCg,"Goes both way mama bear, you are luckily to hold the bond you have. God bless you and your family."
WjOowWxOXCg,"God bless u and ur family..especially ur son😚 about me, i wasnt loved enough by my parent, my father left us when i was just 2 yr old, and my mom taking care of us and my 4 siblings, she love us but not so love bcoz she doesnt value our education.. now i have one child, a daughter and i love her soooo much! She&#39;s my whole world, I will do everything for her and i want her to finish school and have a great a great family someday😊 i promise to myself i will be a good mother and friend to her until my last breath..😊"

WjOowWxOXCg,"@Jonathan &amp; Brittany Cross It merely means that marriage does not have the santity and importance in our eyes like it once was, the certificate doesn&#39;t mean anything unless there&#39;s experience to back it up just like in the cases of a pilot or a surgeon"
WjOowWxOXCg,I am so sorry. That sounds so hard.
WjOowWxOXCg,"@Jonathan &amp; Brittany Cross that is very bad comparison, unlike marriage, to get those papers you need years of schooling and dedicate a lot of time for that, while any idiot can enter into marriageand get that paper, not to mention couple without paper can have better relationship and be longer together than the ones with paper"
WjOowWxOXCg,And can you believe society teaches marriage isn&#39;t important anymore?<br><br>They say &quot;it&#39;s just a piece of paper&quot;<br>If you asked you pilot if he had a license and he said &quot;it&#39;s justbs piece of paper&quot; or your surgeon and he said &quot;it&#39;d just s piece of paper&quot; I bet you would then understand it is not in fact just a piece of paper.

WjOowWxOXCg,@haylee yeah not quite good enough to make up for the mass rapes and baby genocides yet though
WjOowWxOXCg,The only thing from the bible so far I think is good
WjOowWxOXCg,@default thank you
WjOowWxOXCg,0-5 is the foundation of everything:)
WjOowWxOXCg,Cassandra H ..<br>Find a good friend to talk to. I unfortunately do not trust very easily and cannot open up easily. I did go therapist but in the end it would have been better just to have someone give you a big hug. The support and someone who really listens/cares makes all difference. Good luck and may you find peace.
WjOowWxOXCg,"@Are You Kidding? thank you for sharing your story. Parents are the people you first look to for love and reassurance, and because I was not met with these needs I feel as if I am emotionally stunted. It seems that my low sense of self worth has directly affected me, the people I choose to have in my life, and the decisions that I make. I too have a lot of work in building up my self esteem. I wish therapy were more accessible to me, but for now talking to people like you really helps. I hope your journey to peace and recovery continues. You are a good person."
WjOowWxOXCg,Cassandra Hulbert ..I have wondered the same thing..My father was always mentally abusive to my mom and very distant to his children. My brother did not talk to me. I ended up marrying a guy who was also abusive but I hung on a long time thinking this was the way it was supposed to be. I did see therapist but I have found meditation 🧘‍♂️ and the app Calm very helpful in building up my self esteem and finding some inner peace.
WjOowWxOXCg,yep.<br>I think I got my grandmas narcissism. idk.<br>very animosity to my dad too.<br>we both were sensitive and got wrecked and went cold and self serving... borderline to survive.<br><br>he became quiet.<br>I became loud agressive and obsessed with learning to prove I&#39;m smart.<br>also. thanks narcissist teachers from my elementary school
WjOowWxOXCg,"Hi, I&#39;m sorry to hear that you&#39;re in a tough situation, so what I wanted to let you know is that you should try to NEVER TAKE THINGS PERSONAL, while what others express is merely a reflection of how they feel, so this has NOTHING to do with you rather than with them being incapable of expressing themselves in a positive &amp; motivational way (because they never learned). You cannot teach someone something you haven&#39;t learned yourself, so try to see through the bad behavior, maybe he hasn&#39;t had much love in his life himself? Than he wouldn&#39;t know how to express love because he never learned... <br>As a parent deep in your heart you would want the best for your kid, so I guess his pushing you to do better in school could be interpreted as a form of love, because he wants you to do good (which means he DOES care, however expresses that in a somewhat clumsy way :)) <br>If you feel like talking to a therapist could help you, why not? What is there to lose? But only if you&#39;d like to, not because others tell you to..<br>What I&#39;ve learned is that LOVE is the only answer, so try to send your dad some positive thoughts, try to see the positive things, express yourself that you DO love him, this can turn people into different persons! And in the meantime never doubt yourself, LOVE yourself! You have your whole life ahead of you, and you can accomplish ANYTHING, as long as you believe in yourself and have trust in life! Keep going! ;)"
WjOowWxOXCg,"Love is freedom. You should love YOURSELF fully first, enjoy life, STOP being insecure or seeing yourself as a burden. You ARE already whole and complete, and perfect as you are! You do not need someone else to make you complete and fill your imaginary gaps. You ARE already whole, you don&#39;t need anything or anyone! If you&#39;re just happy with yourself, you will radiate this positive energy out, which will automatically attract people because it is a sign of love towards yourself, that is freedom, THAT is attractive! Make sure you don&#39;t NEED someone, because needing is attachment, and this negative energy will push people away. LOVE YOURSELF!! If YOU won&#39;t love yourself, why would you think others would? SHINE! Life is great! &lt;3"

WjOowWxOXCg,"it&#39;s easier said than done, dude. the problematic parents  just don&#39;t have a clue."
WjOowWxOXCg,This is seriously  the most helpful comment ive ever seen
WjOowWxOXCg,But you know that they matter.
WjOowWxOXCg,"Maybe i can help you as i am the kind of guy that think we will be best friends if we have some dinners;<br>As i am lonely since forever and i have emotional disorder (with others disorders that i still don’t know yet) if someone is kind to me and do stuff with me, even if it’s “basic stuff” my brain will just be out of my control and i will start acting weird as you describe. Idk if it help you but to resume it’s like if you give a lot of money to a homeless guy, he will be happy. Same for “us”, give us something we crave more than anything else and we’ll react naturally without hiding it like the homeless would."
WjOowWxOXCg,"There are different forms of communication, it’s not just talking. Babies, toddlers and very young children can read body language, facial expressions and your tone of voice. Essentially it’s up to the parent to communicate properly with love and patience and the child responds to that energy."
WjOowWxOXCg,"Express love, Love is the only answer to everything..Make sure the child feels safe and confident, so be attentive to what the child needs"
WjOowWxOXCg,Very insightful. Thanks 🙏🏻

WjOowWxOXCg,@Frost Night You are welcome.<br>Bitte :)
WjOowWxOXCg,@HardworkingSlacker what a surprisingly beautiful response. Danke
WjOowWxOXCg,Screwed from the start but not necessarily until the end.<br>Seek help if you feel like you need it. It can drastically alleviate your issues.<br>Be well!
WjOowWxOXCg,Thanks for sharing. I hope things eventually fall in place for you! One day you might even be able make peace with your family ✌🏾
WjOowWxOXCg,Yes
WjOowWxOXCg,@Sprouts I have tried but nothing really works plus I feel embarrassed doing yoga by my self
WjOowWxOXCg,"Hi Natasha, did you think about starting a hobby, even virtually, like a online pregnancy yoga course or something of that kind? Especially with young kids there are many opportunities to meet new people, in toddler groups, etc. I wish all the best and that you find positive company soon!"
WjOowWxOXCg,"Thank you, Cheryl!"
WjOowWxOXCg,@Brook Kay 😭❤️
WjOowWxOXCg,"Not true! I had a horrible childhood feared anyone I was around, I didn’t trust a soul. I now have an almost 2 year old I’m a stay at home mom &amp; I know how to care for him more than my parents did for me, I’m also not having any more children tho. It may be a mistake for a damaged person to have multiple kids in my opinion just bc it’s already hard to get it right so why make it harder .."
WjOowWxOXCg,That&#39;s not true. People with bad parents can be good parents and people with good parents can be bad parents. You just have to learn from another person how to take care of your children and check yourself frequently.
WjOowWxOXCg,"well, and the other danger that nobody else is bringing up is that, in an attempt to &quot;not be like mom or dad,&quot; you go to far to the other side and instead fuck up your kid by spoiling them rotten and giving no discipline, which is honestly just as unhealthy and damaging in the long run as being emotionally distant"
WjOowWxOXCg,It is great that you are aware of it and raised you own kids differently! That is not obvious!
WjOowWxOXCg,@M Starr yes it&#39;s called respecting and teaching your children valuable lessons.
WjOowWxOXCg,@Faith Stern you didn&#39;t have that abusive of a childhood then
WjOowWxOXCg,@Akshit Tiwari then maybe you shoulda did a better job as a parent
WjOowWxOXCg,"@Blahblahablah that&#39;s no excuse. You decide to have kids, you take responsibility for your actions"
WjOowWxOXCg,"this comment section is entirely subjective, how about we get an actual psychologist?"
WjOowWxOXCg,good one
WjOowWxOXCg,Not oversimplified. Its true. I was abused and neglected since birth. I changed and refused to be my mom. My child is happy and intelligent. Stop blaming and take charge of your life.
WjOowWxOXCg,nah it’s easy to change something that had imprinted on you since childhood. this is just victim blaming and trying to point fingers at anything other than themselves.
WjOowWxOXCg,"I find it interesting that many are claiming your statement to be simplified yet are simplyfying themselves.<br><br>It is very true what you quoted, you&#39;re not implying if it is hard or easy, you are merely stating that it is up to the individual to work on their on flaws, being them their fault or not."
WjOowWxOXCg,@Victor Tauber They try to help.
WjOowWxOXCg,"i get so mad with this people here saying &quot;try this, try that, try drinking water and relaxing&quot;, you guys should try shutting you mouth"
WjOowWxOXCg,God loves you..may he encourage you..read Bible
WjOowWxOXCg,@N3gative Em0t1ons Take care
WjOowWxOXCg,"@N3gative Em0t1ons People misrepresent the Lord all the time, so i don&#39;t blame you. But don&#39;t allow the errors of others to keep you away from Christ. I&#39;d love to hear your story"
WjOowWxOXCg,Same here
WjOowWxOXCg,i do the same.Every single word i can relate to.
WjOowWxOXCg,"Thanks to the internet you know that you are definitely not alone with this . Isolation in childhood can affect us to do this and our brain tries to seek an alternative to cope. You need to start repairing  your mind and then you will start to feel some happiness in the real world , professional private counselling targeting your specific issues as well as boosting you self worth . Good luck"
WjOowWxOXCg,"@Fernanda Abreu this dude just told you nitwits what he goes through and how he wishes he could leave his imaginary world with imaginary friends and step into a reality like one he dreams of and what is your advice? Oh Rian, don&#39;t worry just add this extra imaginary friend to the list and you&#39;d be fine."
WjOowWxOXCg,"You&#39;re not alone :) i also struggled with many issues and still do. Often i also feel disconnected from reality. But i did and do the same thing as @Fernanda Abreu is doing. I just talk to Jesus and tell him everything. Prayer is really helpful and also the truth, that it&#39;s okay to be broken :) don&#39;t stress yourself it&#39;s okay to need time to heal and become real. You&#39;re beautifully made and loved don&#39;t forget that. :) Don&#39;t beat yourself up, but also don&#39;t blame others. Take your time :) what helpes me in general also is not only to &quot;live&quot; in my head but just start doing something. Sport or music. Not sure if this helped, but have a good day :)"
WjOowWxOXCg,Same
WjOowWxOXCg,"I think the way you feel towards your family is quite genuine. To keep some emotional distance, after what you went through, might be the most healthy thing for you to do. It is only up to you to decide if you want or need to build up a new relationship to them. Wishing you and your kids all the best!"
WjOowWxOXCg,"You need not feel any guilt fr ur parents sins.God will not condemn you fr that.Try to get out of ur guilt and shame - for that u only NEED TO KNOW that GOD LOVES <a href=""http://you.you/"">YOU.You</a> r loved by <a href=""http://jesus.read/"">JESUS.Read</a> BIBLE everyday.People can be bad to us but GOD always loves us .Hope u can forgive ur parents"
WjOowWxOXCg,Thank you for sharing this Janet! All the best to you and your daughter!
WjOowWxOXCg,Ashtray Wasp Yes. She understands. We work together.
WjOowWxOXCg,"Can i ask, do you talk about it with your daughter?"
WjOowWxOXCg,"Yes, please add subtitles in Arabic!"
WjOowWxOXCg,You deserve happiness.
WjOowWxOXCg,"I am so sorry you have had to deal with so much at s young age. I too had to deal with a dysfunctional family. You are now the CEO of your life. You get to decide what works or does not. If people are toxic, stay away from them. I too have had to do this. But once I did, my life greatly improved!  Wishing you healing and only the best for a brighter , new future."
WjOowWxOXCg,"I have lived similar childhood, it was very difficult until I didn’t finish the school. Once I finished the school, found job to maintain myself and found good boyfriend everything started going better. I started to have a life that I always wanted. But there is still trauma living with me, I am 41 and I still didn’t completely recover."
WjOowWxOXCg,"@Mil T  Your childhood is what happened to me too, but glad to know that you are doing well, hope you feel better with time"
WjOowWxOXCg,"@Abhinav Sajid This is really very sad, hope you get more love and peace in your life"
WjOowWxOXCg,Same here.
WjOowWxOXCg,:(
WjOowWxOXCg,i feel you
WjOowWxOXCg,"I used to blame them, but now im not anymore, cuz even blaming I dont think they deserve, everytime I think about them, I reject it."
WjOowWxOXCg,That&#39;s a very positive attitude.
WjOowWxOXCg,"You&#39;re not allowing for your brain&#39;s development, it&#39;s not something you can reason away"
WjOowWxOXCg,"Great start there, accepting your responsibility as an adult. I know far too many people still blaming everyone and everything for their unhappiness....you just have to move on from the past. The past does hurt most often, but you will find a positive way to vent.....that’s key to recovery"
WjOowWxOXCg,People born into dysfunctional families are at a disadvantage from the beginning. They have to fight through the problems their parents cause while normal families develop thrive and progress healthily.
WjOowWxOXCg,"cringe anti-natalist existentialist take, would immediately discard if I didn&#39;t have a lot to say about it<br><br>change your opinion now. the earth needs more manpower in its righteous struggle, but it must be of high quality, from the right people. And anyone who&#39;s wise enough to read and comprehend the flawed point you&#39;ve attempted to make hits the mark better than the majority of people multiplying in this world, and goodness forbid perfectly capable people start believing in your defeatist rhetoric that poisons the minds of our fellow youth. It is time for an intellectually raised generation that excels in the inheritance of wisdom to prevent weakness, physical capability to elevate wellbeing, and most of all: performance over numbers. There is no safety in the unwashed masses. Generation Z, now is no time for fear, it is a time for action. We must restore a broken world to a healed state, and only we can fix it. Do not dwell on how none of this was our fault, for the world has always flourished when good men plant the seeds for trees whose shade they know they shall never sit under. This is what we must do. Don&#39;t let millenia worth of successful evolution go to waste."
WjOowWxOXCg,I agree
WjOowWxOXCg,I love you. Hang in there.
WjOowWxOXCg,I wish you all the best for your relationships!
WjOowWxOXCg,@Antwi Dominic ok. I will wait. See you three years from now. :)
WjOowWxOXCg,"Keidy xxi I will return here three years time to find out if you still hold on to this idea 😊.     I never wanted to have a child because of the way I was brought up,  A girlfriend I was co habited with got pregnant and delivered a pretty baby girl, the love I have for her is incomparable and I am doing all I can to be father I never had.."

WjOowWxOXCg,haha!
WjOowWxOXCg,"@Purple Crystal I don&#39;t believe you owe anything to a toxic parent who runs you down and humiliates and belittles you.  I have no qualms about walking away from a person who causes me pain, even if it were a parent."
WjOowWxOXCg,"@Purple Crystal Leave her alone as I did, you don’t need to pay anything back because you didn’t even ask her to give you life or not."
WjOowWxOXCg,@Purple Crystal i&#39;m so sorry to hear that.. might have been so hard for you.. i hope one day God will gives ur life a more beautiful life and had a children someday being more happy you and more happy family on ur own ^^
WjOowWxOXCg,"@H20fanatic20 I&#39;m 19 and still flinching, how did you get through it?"
WjOowWxOXCg,Or emotionally abusive and have a  good relationship with their spouse
WjOowWxOXCg,@amit rajput bro atfirst get some knowledge. People are post graduating in that subject ( psychology). And you are sitting and commenting and telling them useless... don&#39;t make fun of urself  😂😂
WjOowWxOXCg,"Read all the comments...and  people are arguing whether therapy is useful or not... let me tell you one thing the people who are telling you that therapy is not needed , they don&#39;t have any knowledge about mental health , psychology and mental disorders. Wonder how people throw their rubbish opinion without even knowing the subject. Atfirst read research . Don&#39;t mislead people. I went to a therapist and it&#39;s totally scientific and useful. Atfirst self council youself and if still u need help Don&#39;t think 2nd time to go to a therapist. Just do it...!!"
WjOowWxOXCg,@amit rajput sounds like you were well taken care of and can&#39;t relate. you can&#39;t imagine something&#39;s missing if you don&#39;t know firsthand or don&#39;t care. i do get it that this theory is repeated over and over though. We need more well formed studies.
WjOowWxOXCg,@Agent cocoa 😔🥺🥺🥺
WjOowWxOXCg,"Therapy is great even if you think things are just fine. It&#39;s like an athlete, if you are strong and fast... Actual training will help you improve in ways that you don&#39;t understand"
WjOowWxOXCg,Good frick I relate to that way more than I should.
WjOowWxOXCg,You also get their strengths.
WjOowWxOXCg,"To an extent I agree. But, we do <del>certainly now, in this day and age</del> have both the information, tools and consciousness to break the cycle.<br><br>Not easy though. First you have to admit to yourself you’re a mess and everything you believe might just be subconscious programming. Imagine that. That shit is hard. We are so attached to our beliefs, even when they are so harmful to us. This means the self has  to actually die. (Metaphorically) Definitely not an easy process."
WjOowWxOXCg,"@Francis Norton Ah yes, thank you! I  knew it was Larkin but I forgot what poem it was. I studied a few of his poems back in school."
WjOowWxOXCg,"@Ro &quot;This be the Verse&quot; - though most people know the poem by its first line, obviously :)"
WjOowWxOXCg,I love you. Hang in there.
WjOowWxOXCg,You&#39;ll grow up salivating for a big knob in the chops.
WjOowWxOXCg,Yes. The mother is a metaphor for any primary caregiver.
WjOowWxOXCg,@a hahah
WjOowWxOXCg,Liezl G let’s hope you don’t meet any Becks then
WjOowWxOXCg,"You’re parents raised you well. You are blessed.  For the most part I always raised well, I was more closer to my mom than my dad though. I know I’m capable of loving and relationships but sometimes I need space too."
WjOowWxOXCg,@Sprouts thank you for reading!
WjOowWxOXCg,Thanks for sharing Alisa!
WjOowWxOXCg,That’s very very good you do that!
WjOowWxOXCg,I relate a lot. I know my parents love me but its so hard to love them back because of all the trauma and neglect. Sometimes I would think that they’re not that bad but then they disappoint me again. Its an endless cycle and Im already so tired of it. Im young and I cant go anywhere right now so I have to wait longer.
WjOowWxOXCg,I think we have same path of past emotional relation with parents!😑
WjOowWxOXCg,Thanks for sharing this. I’ll hope you’ll find your way out of that eventually. 🙏🏻
WjOowWxOXCg,Thanks for sharing this!
WjOowWxOXCg,that&#39;s enough for me as long as no physical abuse
WjOowWxOXCg,I feel u
WjOowWxOXCg,"@Sprouts Thank you ! Your words mean a lot to me, it can be a.lonely world sometimes. 💚"
WjOowWxOXCg,Thanks for this! I think I couldn’t agree more!
WjOowWxOXCg,"Sprouts well yea, I try. But I’m never at my moms house, But I do support them whenever I can."
WjOowWxOXCg,Yes. You can support your sisters.
WjOowWxOXCg,@Sprouts Christmas or Birthday maybe?
WjOowWxOXCg,Life! I hope one day she can!
WjOowWxOXCg,Thanks for sharing this.
WjOowWxOXCg,sorry to hear that!
WjOowWxOXCg,"@guleet believe me, you really don&#39;t want the loneliness that comes with it"
WjOowWxOXCg,@Lorena Brady only for a son? What about a daughter ? 😅
WjOowWxOXCg,@Hannah X I did forgive my parents and stepmother for mistreating me. Pain is less but now attachment to life is fading . I feel like becoming a nun or something .
WjOowWxOXCg,"You probably don&#39;t want to hear this, but the only way to break the cycle with your kids is by forgiving your parents. Otherwise the resentment will stay there hiding, and in a few years you will do just what they did. I&#39;ve seen this happen many times"
WjOowWxOXCg,Happy to hear that! :)
WjOowWxOXCg,I come across your story and feel really sorry for you. I am 26 yo as well. I think you should move away from your family as soon as possible and start a new life if you are still living with them. I understand this may not heal your pain and trauma that seeded in you but at least get away from the abuser that is causing the harm and further damage to your mental and emotional health. Thank you for sharing your story. I wish you the best.
WjOowWxOXCg,Thanks for sharing this May!

WjOowWxOXCg,Thanks for sharing this!
WjOowWxOXCg,"You should really get a therapist to help you work through this. You don&#39;t have the idea how you should treat the child, because you weren&#39;t treated that way. We need to learn it and can;t do it on our own"

WjOowWxOXCg,@Sprouts hey thanks:-)
WjOowWxOXCg,Congratulations 🎈
WjOowWxOXCg,"Nobody fully understands who they really are. If they say they do, they are lying. That would be like saying &quot;I understand the nature of the universe.&quot;  <br>And everybody sometimes has self-doubts unless you&#39;re a narcissist or a psychopath."
WjOowWxOXCg,"@OK Boomer no. I had no hard numbers. Just observable patterns. I wish I had access to hard numbers, but still it&#39;s very subjective data. The hypothesis is strong,  and this theory supports it, but you are right. People want quantitative data."
WjOowWxOXCg,"<a href=""http://no.you/"">No.You</a> just don&#39;t have kids if you have mental disorders."
WjOowWxOXCg,"well apparently Einstein had borderline personality disorder, which usually develops from being abandoned and uncared for as a child. <br>Also kids have different genetic codes, timelines when they were raised, family dynamics and roles etc."
WjOowWxOXCg,"Well, no. I am not able to trust people (especially men) thanks to my abusive father. It doesn&#39;t make me successful. It just makes me feel empty and dead inside."
WjOowWxOXCg,"Yes, indeed. However, that falls under wisdom and not under a certain type of attachment as far as I am concerned!"
WjOowWxOXCg,"I never had a relationship with my parents when i lived in their house. when i moved out at 18 to another country i started talking to my dad more and he is one of my best friends now. I cut out my mom. They are just people at the end of the day, and like all people, some are great and some are just shitty"
WjOowWxOXCg,Thanks
WjOowWxOXCg,I hope you will be feeling better one day and you’ll be able to forgive yourself and stop hating yourself. Thanks for sharing!
WjOowWxOXCg,We don&#39;t even yet fully understand what flaws are genetic or not. Eugenics led to the forced sterilization of tens of thousands. There is no excuse for that.
WjOowWxOXCg,Exactly!
WjOowWxOXCg,"Only America doesn’t allow people drink alcohol until they’re 21. Not the rest of the world. This is ridiculous ! Here in Europe, we are allowed to drink beer and wine at 16 and at 18 we can drink spirits. In the US., you can join the army and get sent off to die before you’re allowed to have a beer. You’re also allowed to get married before you can drink a beer. The priorities are completely wrong."
WjOowWxOXCg,At least make new parents go to mandatory parenting classing and take a test and have to keep going until they pass you cant force people to not have kids its nature
WjOowWxOXCg,🤣

WjOowWxOXCg,@Self Engineering Identity Therapy. I think there is in most countries in Europe. We all could give and recieve closeness and human warmth. We processed our emotions.

WjOowWxOXCg,@LolaBandola  thanks very much. Stay blessed
WjOowWxOXCg,I would like to share how I did. I found a group where I could grow emotionally and become much more of a whole person. It did not help for every problem in life but my relationships were improved.<br>💗👍💗
WjOowWxOXCg,"It would! But I dare to say that no 5 min. video can give all the answers for that... But if you are looking for therapy, we describe a few options in the description of the video. All the best to you!"
WjOowWxOXCg,Celeste Garcia okay
WjOowWxOXCg,"🤗 I would like to share how I did. After long time of searching I found a very good group therapy. It was so much of releaving... omg. Just ask, then I will tell you more. <br>🌹👍☺💖🌹"
WjOowWxOXCg,"Please look at the suggestions in the description below! Basically, any form of therapy can be helpful. What is good for us, differs so much. Some people need to talk, others find healing through movement or music. I know, that in some places, like England, you can even find &quot;attachment therapy&quot; with psychologists who specialize in this subject."

WjOowWxOXCg,Thank you Christine!
WjOowWxOXCg,"I think that sometimes we also take over fears that are actually not ours, but come from the experience of previous generations. Children are open and likely to adapt to unconscious &quot;body&quot; language (f.e. tone of voice or body tension in certain situation) of their parent, which may transfer all kids of emotions."

WjOowWxOXCg,"@Bichen Up Ur - I see what you mean... It hurts imagining how much more creative and carefree I was as a kid, <b>but</b> what you said is actually the sole reason <b>why</b> I imagined hugging my child self. I hated how sad and broken I felt as a young adult and wondered what happened in my childhood to make me the way I am today. Hugging <b>her</b> made me feel whole again, even if it hurt. I think why you may have felt more hurt than relieved is because your mind may be overly crowded with sad thoughts and feelings like a broken record. Nostalgia can add to the sadness if your mind keeps subconsciously repeating the same sad thoughts like, &quot;If only I could go back to the way things used to be...&quot; or &quot;I wanna be a kid again...&quot; That&#39;s why when I hug my child self I remind myself to hug her as if im living in the moment, only focusing on her, the simulated sensation of the embrace, the clothes she&#39;s wearing, and <b>why</b> im hugging her. It helped me but, of course, it&#39;s not going to immediately help everyone."
WjOowWxOXCg,"The thing is, it&#39;s disappointing to talk to your child self while being in such a sad state. You hate yourself now for being such a weak person. Seeing that as a child going through neglect you were still such a happier carefree person hurts more than it does relieve."

WjOowWxOXCg,@Arwa You are strong ❤️
WjOowWxOXCg,Very true
WjOowWxOXCg,@Todesengel I&#39;m sure your mom loved you a lot but something has happened when you were 7 and then things became difficult for her. Probably not her fault. I am happy to hear that you still do feel deeply attached.
WjOowWxOXCg,@Sprouts Thank you for your response and your thoughts. It means a lot. I know my situation is a little different than the others u listed so it&#39;s ok ur not totally sure.<br>I do still feel deeply attached to my mom even though she isn&#39;t with me anymore. When I&#39;m sad I think if her  and wished she could be there. I relate alot to Anne and Joe
WjOowWxOXCg,"I&#39;m sad to hear that and I&#39;m not sure in what kind of aspect you might be insecurely attached. You might want to consider asking those close to you who you trust that they give you a warm and honest reply. <br><br>The fact that this all started quite late, you said seven, leaves alot of optimism that deep down you might still feel a strong attachment, which could give you strength. <br><br>Hope this helps! To learn more about yourself and your past, you might want to consider doing a Hoffmann Process, if thats even an option and you think you&#39;d be ready to go back in time."
WjOowWxOXCg,So sorry to hear that!

Defending myself from annoying kid when he trying to hit me, instead getting both my parents defending me too, my mom choose to hit me while my dad not. I also watch alot my parents fight in the middle of the night. My mom are overworked, and really moody. Dad are asshole and changes woman alot, this resulting divorce. My mother go easily angry and do beat me up if i do thing i like, to the time when she doesnt want hit me again she choose to hit herself and do hurting herself alot to the times she had enough with her emotions. Stress already hit me when i reach middle school, and This type of stuff make me now in adults stage feel really traumatic and really panicking so easily, i less feeling my emotions, can be happy and sad so fast. <br><br>My mother already telling story why she becomes like this, she said sorry to me as things he did too me, she single parents and i really care and love her. But how about all the memories she makes me tho. Its just so sad."
WjOowWxOXCg,My mother never showed encouragement to me. She always said whatever I attempted to do &quot;oh im sure u can&#39;t do this&quot; she always portrayed herself to be the only one who could do everything and always took on more than she needed to and made herself as the martyr but no one needed her to do that she did it herself.. till now i feel no interest in household activities bc of that thing she always told me oh u cant do this that u cant do it like me as if she wanted me not to do better. And my dad was just a guy i always believed not destined to be in a family system.. thats why not all guys should marry. :) the only parent like figure i had were my grandparents who taught me the little ik now :) I actually pray that the family i marry into are more normal than mine so i can get a parental figure there

Mom said i didn&#39;t care much when one of them parents came. Not a very broken childhood, but i have traits from all these attachment types. Whats really broken is my desire to have any relationships now because everyone i cared about didn&#39;t give a shit about me. It&#39;s no use being kind. Adulthood shaped me more than childhood, that ratio is gonna be personal for everyone"

WjOowWxOXCg,"@Satan Yes but if both parents work then they tend to be more stressed out, get less sleep, spend more time on house chores and kids than on each other, etc. <br><br>Also, of course it isn&#39;t staying home that makes a parent good, but staying home leads to no work stress for the mother, which is a good thing, and she can do more house chores and teach the children to clean up everything in the house at the same time, and also homeschool them. I&#39;m gonna homeschool, because I believe that public school (or any school) is an unnatural way to raise a child, an unnatural and less optimal form of education, and that it does more harm than good generally.<br><br>Also, your critique of that Christian family was vague. They ignored their children&#39;s feelings? How? I&#39;ve gone over to a secular family&#39;s house where the mom would cuss out her three year old grandson regularly. Christianity emphasizes love, kindness, humility, gentleness, patience, etc. <br><br>There are Christians I&#39;ve met who are the sweetest people on earth, and there are people who call themselves Christians who are flat out hypocrites.

But just having a full time nanny wouldn’t throw it over the edge(unless the nanny was abusive in some way and that made you resentful toward the workload). There is a lot more going on there. Keep digging."
WjOowWxOXCg,That doesn&#39;t have anything to do with your attachment. In fact a single nanny that you would have known throughout childhood is an excellent childcare choice. If you have poor attachment it isn&#39;t to do with your mother working but to do with her emotional intelligence and the way she responded to you as an infant when you did see her.

Even from the wound, despite the difficulties, I read and sang to my baby letting him know that no matter what, mama is here and that I couldn’t wait to meet him.

WjOowWxOXCg,I don&#39;t know I also kind of felt that. Although my mom was a homemaker and was at home taking care of me while I grew up. I felt a combination of the last 3 even though my mom loved me loads. I also loved her a lot and I miss her very much after I lost her.

WjOowWxOXCg,@Vanderbam that could also play a part indeed.
WjOowWxOXCg,Really? I think it&#39;s much more likely that being removed from your mother and placed in foster care as an infant is what caused the attachment issue (not saying it wasn&#39;t the best option).

But in my childhood I got bullied in school for years and I grew up having very few friends and trust issues. Couldn&#39;t communicate well with people (outside family) and never formed a romantic relationship because I trust nobody and easily uncomfortable.

WjOowWxOXCg,"I agree so much with this!!!!! when I was little I wasn&#39;t bullied heavily but I could see some people making fun of me because of the way I look (because I wasn&#39;t pretty like the other girls), or because I&#39;m too quiet and don&#39;t talk at all, and because of me being quiet some girl spread a rumor about me and couldn&#39;t defend myself and the entire class judged me for something i didn&#39;t do, also I couldn&#39;t understand people&#39;s mean jokes and  I didn&#39;t find them funny (for exemple a group of classmates laughing at somebody)"
WjOowWxOXCg,That’s terrible!
WjOowWxOXCg,Definitely not. Working mothers have nothing to do with emotional immaturity causing poor attachment.
WjOowWxOXCg,"My mom was a stay at home mom, but I am anxious avodiant because my parents were very strict :("
WjOowWxOXCg,I think both the parents are needed to nurture children so that they don&#39;t feel like they are missing out on anything
WjOowWxOXCg,"The father wasn&#39;t always available, he went hunting for days risking his life, he is more important from age 7 onwards when we explore the outside world. The mother figure was biologically programmed in the brain to be our first attachment and relationship model for our entire life, she is more empathic and a nurturer, she is also gentler which is safer for the kids, also because of her capacity to produce milk. Its our nature, don&#39;t you like nature? Go against nature at your own risk."
WjOowWxOXCg,"Now I wonder what happened to me.. I dont miss my family and friends when Im out of the country and I cannot tell my family about issues , although my mom was also a stay at home mom and my dad worked but always came home right after and they are both really sweet. Im still not sure why I feel like I cannot tell them anything .."
WjOowWxOXCg,"Thats a great break through! I think it makes total sense. As such a small baby you needed to be with mum. Some studies shows that child needs its mother present till age 3, till age 1 they don&#39;t even recognise they are two humans. Congrats on understanding yourself better :)<br>My mum lost her mum when I was 7 months and she was totally destroyed by it and her friend was taking care of me.. I think there it is for me too. Plus bully brother later.. I am avoidant and sometimes anxious, still trying to build that safe space within myself and be better person to those who happend to love me."
WjOowWxOXCg,Thank u!  U just helped me figure something out for myself! I had some simular weirdness! Mystery solved! Thank u for ur story and update!
WjOowWxOXCg,"It&#39;s so amazing to see you reflect and realize what made you this way! I have also always struggled with self esteem issues, but recently reconnected with my family and have a stronger bond than ever. Looking in and understanding myself really helped me on my journey - so kudos to you too :)) We&#39;re all in this together!"
WjOowWxOXCg,"Rachel Wharton I had similar situation .my parents because they were both working gave me to my grandparents to raise me till I was 3 and were visiting me every 15 days. My mum told me that it always took me some time to get used to them every time they visited me. I had the strongest bond with my grandparents and I was crying for weeks when I had to part with my grandparents and live with my parents. Even now it’s not a concrete memory but it’s was one the saddest feelings I can remember from my childhood when i had to say goodby to my grandparents after we visited <a href=""http://them.my/"">them.My</a> grandpa- dead some years now- was my most beloved person in the world. On the other side I still struggle to connect and bond with my parents . I never felt especially as a teen sharing anything with my parents and was always scared of their response. Until now that I am thirty I find it hard to really connect with my parents."
WjOowWxOXCg,"@Jack Deniston Yes, worse than worthless.. it is misleading."
WjOowWxOXCg,"So, worthless then."
WjOowWxOXCg,"@Sprouts Aw bless you thank you, I&#39;ve got a lot of offers of help which is great :)"
WjOowWxOXCg,"Congratulations and all the best wishes to you and your baby! Try to take help from good people around you, to get some rest, as often as you can!"
WjOowWxOXCg,"Thanks galfisk, for sharing and for the recommendation!"
WjOowWxOXCg,"Angel, ugh that sucks and I’m sorry."
WjOowWxOXCg,"I do agree. Although it is quite relevant to the idea of the development of personality disorders. I think the caveat is that it&#39;s not meant to describe working mothers as generating poor attachment (at least not in a modern context), but rather emotionally immature mothers."
WjOowWxOXCg,I have that carefully built facade for social interaction with other people. I don&#39;t really trust people after years of bullying. If I need social interaction I&#39;d much rather interact with the people I made up in my head.
WjOowWxOXCg,@The alien in your backyard I have the same issue. I&#39;ve been developing a method of customizing the personality I want to express myself. Its sort of like how actors get into character. I mean I&#39;m not being myself now anyways I just act cold and indifferent. So if I&#39;m going to act why not act the way I choose instead of the default crap.
WjOowWxOXCg,@The alien in your backyard don&#39;t worry dear everything will be fine
WjOowWxOXCg,@The alien in your backyard it&#39;s something. .you are saying about me..like seriously
WjOowWxOXCg,"@manpreet kaur  Yep , one of my fake personas."
WjOowWxOXCg,I&#39;m Communist
WjOowWxOXCg,"I&#39;m trying, ok? It&#39;s just that I seem to be particularly bad at it..."
WjOowWxOXCg,I find this attitude boring. I hate people who demonise the abused because the demonisers are abusers themselves. We want to get ourselves sorted but judgmental types like you hinder this. Perhaps you want to abuse too! Think!
WjOowWxOXCg,"@Nibbler800 yup, it is"
WjOowWxOXCg,@L Franco cheers
WjOowWxOXCg,"Barawen Who, Lol I’m sorry but no honey. You did not develop wrong. There’s no such thing as right and wrong, every body is on a spectrum. You shouldn’t position yourself or other so far away from each other. You matter. You belong. I’m proud of you."
WjOowWxOXCg,That is regarding faith in the Triune God I suppose.😇<br>May GBY
WjOowWxOXCg,Amen Amen. May the Lord grace us
WjOowWxOXCg,"They always seem to know best, because....they observed the neighbors or something."
WjOowWxOXCg,May lilot that’s crazy because you would think a child needs to be in a stressful situation for an extended period of time but it can affect them just after one week. I’m sorry that happened to you
WjOowWxOXCg,"@L Franco Yes, exactly!  I suppose that those in the mental health field continue the myth in order to keep their careers going.  I&#39;m sick of the lie, though.  And now the new lie is &quot;I was abused.&quot;  YAWN!"
WjOowWxOXCg,"Also, every coastal culture ever."
WjOowWxOXCg,Haha same
WjOowWxOXCg,"Children are not pooped, they are born."
WjOowWxOXCg,@Mun Montenez wishing you all the self care in the world.. don&#39;t stop sharing  your history...the right people will love you the more for it.
WjOowWxOXCg,"Farah no, don’t say that you’re too late. you are brave enough to seek help. im touched seeing you took time to reply to my comment. i am still learning to accept my past, it’s hard. struggle to even find stable relationship because i tend to push people away yet at the same time it would be good to have someone who would be there for me because i get tired of figuring everything out. still, thank you for your advice, Farah :)"
WjOowWxOXCg,"@Mun Montenez sorry to hear that.. I too went through the same but am 44 and only now realizing and validate (via my therapist) that I have a dysfunctional family. I hope you get help quickly and don&#39;t wait, like me, to get help at 44. Don&#39;t let your history affect your ability to live a life you were meant to have"
WjOowWxOXCg,"wolfu597 i can relate to your story. i thought i had an amazing childhood but then i went to college and saw how other parents treating their children and it got me into thinking what kind of parents mine is. a dysfunctional one. i thought i had an amazing childhood which i had but all because i was a naughty, law breaker kid. i dont connect with my family, i mostly outside playing with my friends. things started to get hard for me in teen life, no emotional support. living with sister who would express her repressed anger towards my parents to me. i was constantly living in fear of being scolded at, issues to speak up and worst, i got bullied and didnt talk to anyone because this issue is always an unimportant issue in my family. till i got into college, managed to get myself scholarships because i knew my parents wont spend any pennies to me and all of sudden, it hits me what kind of family ive had. family got into major fight in 2016, having rough relationship with both parents and still am struggling to find a balance between being a good daughter and focus on myself. sorry for such a long rant but your comment hits home. we will  both get better of this !"
WjOowWxOXCg,"I have a similar story. I will never forgive my parents for ruining what should be my adolescence, and not being there for me when I need them."
WjOowWxOXCg,You seem like a very considerate and mindful person. With the right partner or the right setup (timing/community) you sure can be a wonderful parent!
WjOowWxOXCg,"Thanks! You can support us at <a href=""http://patreon.com/sprouts"">Patreon.com/sprouts</a> if you like"
WjOowWxOXCg,@Mihaela Mestereaga worse here
WjOowWxOXCg,Or hit
WjOowWxOXCg,@Vane Araujo what is that even supposed to mean. How does a baby reject people. ..if they could care to explain
WjOowWxOXCg,I became rebellious when I was a teenager to fight back. And surprisingly my parents has changed since then. They started to learn how to interact with me.
WjOowWxOXCg,"How could something like that be your fault, you were the natural product of their indulgences, their actions, so, their &quot;fault&quot; if anyones (if to have a child is a fault).<br>Some people are like that, it is up to you to be you now, really, it always was."
WjOowWxOXCg,"So do fathers, a poor parent is a poor parent, no matter what sex they are."
WjOowWxOXCg,"You can support us if you want. We hope we can soon make more videos about the early years: <a href=""http://www.patreon.com/sprouts"">www.patreon.com/sprouts</a>"
WjOowWxOXCg,"@Sprouts thank you so much for validating mine and everyone elses feelings 🙏 it helps to understand certain things better, makes the journey way better than not knowing and drowning."
WjOowWxOXCg,And you can succeed!!! All the best m!
WjOowWxOXCg,"The way I been thrown out and around coz my parents didn&#39;t want me. Y&#39;all can imagine how much harder it is for me to live a healthy life rn. But I&#39;m doing it, I&#39;m pushing, I&#39;m fighting."
WjOowWxOXCg,"Theodore Sweger <br>If you get caught strolling across a border, any border, you will be separated from your children, regardless if you brought them with you for that adventure or not. <br>Also, I am not aware of any genocides happening currently in either Canada or Mexico, that would force people to seek refuge in US."
WjOowWxOXCg,"@Paul Benedict that is true statement, the point is the children are being incosereted, this is insane and immoral  now if you want to argue that thi.s  point that&#39;s a great idea understand what happens to children that are denied proper care and love which they are then you have to live with yourself.  I don&#39;t give a rat&#39;s ass who started it its WRONG..  And if you think fleeing a country automatically makes you a criminal  you are right but mortally wrong.   Jesus there is no room at the inn you are illegal and the child you brought with you will become separated and confined that&#39;s the law.   I am not religious but I believe we will be judged by how we treat others less fortunate."
WjOowWxOXCg,"Theodore Sweger <br>Anyone who breaks the law can be separated from their children, immigrant or not."

WjOowWxOXCg,"@Sprouts Thank you, i will look into this later today for sure."
WjOowWxOXCg,There is a thing called “Hoffmann Process”. I tired it and it’s very intense. But it can help to solve some of these childhood issues. The idea there is to help us make peace with our parents and help let go of the negative sides we inherited as a young child.
WjOowWxOXCg,@Lucrezia Vilante it was depressing 2 years ago when I first wrote that comment but I’ve done a lot of research since &amp; things aren’t as they seem... you want the good news or the bad news first? Lol
WjOowWxOXCg,@Avril Maiu I wish I could care for a child that needs a mom because I&#39;m so naturally nurturing. I just want to hug you! So sorry that you had to miss out on such intimacy in your younger years!
WjOowWxOXCg,Or they will literally revolt and rightfully blame their parents for all the shit they did
WjOowWxOXCg,God is 💕 Amen
WjOowWxOXCg,C A Good Therapy
WjOowWxOXCg,Sprouts all the best!!! surely it&#39;ll be a great success
WjOowWxOXCg,@Damia Batrisyia noted. we will look into it at one point. Currently still too small of a team to do two things at once. Hopefully soon!
WjOowWxOXCg,Sprouts yes definitely should!!! because spotify doesn&#39;t really use much mobile data as youtube video.
WjOowWxOXCg,Not yet. Should we?
WjOowWxOXCg,I wish I could go back in time and eat a calzone in a pizza place that is long gone.
WjOowWxOXCg,"Strong mind can be trained you know. There are people who came from problematic family, abused, etc but more stronger than me which had better life than them. One person i know told me that he was just training his mind to become strong , he pays he&#39;s own tuition on part time jobs and now he&#39;s an architect and happily married with 2 kids<br><br>He even laughed at my problems and tells me that &quot;I should not be a slave to my emotions&quot;"
WjOowWxOXCg,@『Mary』 do it. In your memory.
WjOowWxOXCg,I also wish I could go there and comfort my young self when she&#39;s alone and feeling hopeless:(
WjOowWxOXCg,Magic_Zach True!
WjOowWxOXCg,That generally how it works. Labeling something gives it only a little less power. But calling it out when you see it and deciding when to change is what completely destroys said power.

WjOowWxOXCg,FOESHOW<br>FOESHOW<br>FOESHOW
WjOowWxOXCg,Exactly
WjOowWxOXCg,"My dad never cared about me nor my mom, cause he wanted a boy child, he wanted to abandon me, I wish he did it, but nah! He continued to harass my mom and me everyday, I never saw what is father&#39;s love and  I just came out from that hell, I begged my mom to come with me, but she felt it&#39;s her life and she should accept it. And the reason she gave  is this is Indian tradition and culture, you got to live with your husband even if he is demon to you. I just wish god to give her peace at least a day in her life"
WjOowWxOXCg,Nothing has changed from now because now is STILL now. The same space and time
WjOowWxOXCg,I wanna help other people and by that I mean have a miserable life
WjOowWxOXCg,@xDorothii; Not Uploadin&#39; I&#39;m not sure. That&#39;s how my parents were they yelled non stop.
WjOowWxOXCg,"Omg, I love this channel💓"
WjOowWxOXCg,"Hi, thanks! You are lucky, that&#39;s actually next on our priority list for video topics! ;) Might take another 2-3 months though."
WjOowWxOXCg,Sometimes letting them know how this felt could take some weight off your shoulder. Maybe they had no clue how you felt or maybe thought you just were the way you were
WjOowWxOXCg,"zKennedy, oh my That’s horrible. Im so sorry. Please try and stop re-enacts my the memory in your mind. 😔. It’s better to forget since he’s dead to you anyway. Do you own any pets, cats in particular? You could treat one with love and respect, unless of course that’s a boundary you don’t want to cross. I apologize if I’m sounding insincere."
WjOowWxOXCg,@145191518125183913 it s something my grandparents would say about tv ....
WjOowWxOXCg,"Good God, don’t ‘teach’, let him ‘discover’."
WjOowWxOXCg,That&#39;s the cutest thing that anyone has said about birth
WjOowWxOXCg,Hope you aren’t getting him cut because that already messes up attachments right there.
WjOowWxOXCg,"Good point, thank you Sara!"
WjOowWxOXCg,"Agree with SuddenlyHope, that is not actually attachment and is a reflection of a parent&#39;s own poor attachment during early childhood. The parent who is enmeshed with their child does not actually view their child as a separate individual."
WjOowWxOXCg,Todd That is called enmeshment.
WjOowWxOXCg,"@MoonAcreFalls my dad never raised a finger to me, but did seem to treat me like a liability rather than a person and passed me on to others as much as possible."
WjOowWxOXCg,"Can&#39;t fix the past, but it is possible to improve the future. Try to break the cycle and be a better parent yourself,. If you decide to have children. I can&#39;t really reach my parents anymore  but I am trying to be a better father so my child can reach me later."
WjOowWxOXCg,@Soroush JM Sorry I would like to know your comment but only read in English.

WjOowWxOXCg,Thank you Aziz! Really good to hear that!
WjOowWxOXCg,@Sprouts thank you !
WjOowWxOXCg,"Hi Anime, yes, I agree with you and with delArte. I also think its important to acknowledge the facts, but I also believe we should strive not to feel as victims. Best wishes to you!"
WjOowWxOXCg,@One Soul You&#39;re welcome! Wish you strength and all the best!
WjOowWxOXCg,"@Agnete123 thank you ,  i needed this , i m trying to change my life around and i needed something like this"
WjOowWxOXCg,"Blaming is one thing that you don&quot;t necessarily need to do, but acknowledging and understanding real situation, even if that means seeing that your parents were bad, didn&#39;t love you ant etc is extremely important. It&#39;s a first step."
WjOowWxOXCg,@Betty Boos&#39; Sister this is true
WjOowWxOXCg,@J K now all you have to do is walk then run then fly far far away and then build your own nest
WjOowWxOXCg,@Betty Boos&#39; Sister I&#39;d say I more fell out the nest but I landed on my feet
WjOowWxOXCg,You can always fly away
WjOowWxOXCg,"@Al Gee or maybe attachment thingy and something else could be unified like electricity and magnetism was unified which was considered separate things ,that was what I meant"
WjOowWxOXCg,Definitely can be related. Those are significant things to experience.  I&#39;m sorry you are having such troubles now.
WjOowWxOXCg,"Ven Berrah - Yeah you&#39;ve got a good point there. I did think it was really strange when he said that. And if I&#39;m being honest, things weren&#39;t all hunky dory when I was young. It was probably caused by a lot more things than that trip, but it sure didn&#39;t help anything."
WjOowWxOXCg,"@Rachel Wharton I&#39;m telling you, I think your father was projecting when he said that. A very strange thing to say about a baby."
WjOowWxOXCg,@Brad Kindley thats me
WjOowWxOXCg,"@Lauren Oh, ya.  True.  I was replying to The Blonde Solution about her comment to  the other girl.  Asking why she would be mad at her parents as a baby."
WjOowWxOXCg,@Brad Kindley I understand what you are saying but my comments advice still is very beneficial regardless of the source of stress. worked for me very well
WjOowWxOXCg,I feel the same
WjOowWxOXCg,"If you are super self focused and have trouble bonding you may have something else going on. Might want to hit up a shrink or at least some online psych tests that you can take to a shrink later. Just run the gamut and see if it gives you any insight into yourself. On those 2 descriptors first thoughts would be depression, ADHD (inattentive), ASD, Personality Disorder, PTSD. Remember, don&#39;t diagnose yourself but run it by someone who is supposed to do it if something scores super-high."
WjOowWxOXCg,"Yumpie Oo, 😂 😂 good to be prepared and both of you know what you’re getting yourselves into. It’s not a bad thing to be a parent and want children, just create a family for the right reasons! It takes a village to raise a child, don’t think the two of you (family unit) can do it all by yourself!!"
WjOowWxOXCg,Just like good parents can have screwed up kids. Not everything is parent&#39;s fault.
WjOowWxOXCg,Sorry about that. Hope they didn&#39;t have to send you to being baby sit or to some foster parenting
WjOowWxOXCg,You are not messed up you have just been told what happened and why and you have the power to change it reverse it....Jesus heals everything...no weapon formed against me will prosper it say in the bible a weapon can be a parent...upbringing....
WjOowWxOXCg,"Trust me, friend. You can do it, maybe you think that she is mad at you or something like that, but she raised you and i suppose she gave you everything she could. She raised you even if she maybe didn&#39;t had the means to do it properly, but she tried. And you might think that she hates or is mad at you, but trust me, your mother still loves you, and you should give her at least a chance  and repair your relationship with her. The Parents are the ones who raise you, they are Angels, and trust me, these Angels don&#39;t live forever :&#39;(<br>So do it while you can, my friend. Time waits for no one, and if you don&#39;t do it now, you will regret it for the rest of your life... I Trust you my friend, i know you can do it! Good Luck! Stay Healthy!"
WjOowWxOXCg,"Hi Hilal, maybe you know someone who can create them? That would be great!"
WjOowWxOXCg,"Theres no happy life, theres only slightly happy moments. Facts about real world."
WjOowWxOXCg,Thank you!
WjOowWxOXCg,😥😥
WjOowWxOXCg,Dont tell me what to do
WjOowWxOXCg,"I would rather thank the good people that I have those attachments with, thanks."
WjOowWxOXCg,"Hey!! ! I can understand..The only way to get rid of sadness is to accept that reality and move on..you can&#39;t change him..BUT all you can do is to change yourself. You are just 23 , you have a whole life in front you..you can&#39;t waste it on being sad about your father&#39;s inappropriate behaviour. ALL You can do is move on and live the way you wanna live. Love your mother she is there for you..she has played the role father for you.....I wish god give you happiness and help you in every moment."
WjOowWxOXCg,"I had a difficult childhood. divorced parents when I was 2 years old, a father who only left and a mother who never interested his children and for a long time I felt sadness and then I hate but in the end I just let go of those emotions that hurt me. No one chooses the parents but no matter what one suffers life must continue because one day all the pain passes and there will always be something waiting for us to be happy. My comment comes 6 months after yours I hope that by this date you are much better <br>P.S. sorry my english use translator"
WjOowWxOXCg,In my whole childhood. I suffered from physical and psychological  violence. Other violences too but I dont even want to say these here.
WjOowWxOXCg,Same here too man
WjOowWxOXCg,@Bleng Diabloed you matter! Your important. I just saw this but i hope you are doing better and your ok
WjOowWxOXCg,yessss. i’m 20 and i’m still so confused when my friend tells me things that she tells her mom or how she broke down in front of her. i’ve literally never let myself cry in front of my family
WjOowWxOXCg,this happens to me too. i cant talk to my parents openly
WjOowWxOXCg,@Lucy K Can your family adopt me? I’m half joking.. half not. I’m 20 yrs old and have been on my own since 14 since my mom was abusive in all ways. I just want an education and a family 😢
WjOowWxOXCg,"My parents were abusive, but on public I appear soo close to mama. Mama is good, she just dislike me &amp; I don&#39;t know why... but I openly, politely &amp; playfully talk about every single thing she does and I make sure the sentence is short, beautiful and direct; making her regret the way she abused me.<br>&#39;Parents have a special Ego towards us, so we need to be very patient in this process(I started with silence, if you don&#39;t know to talk politely then be silent please. Because it will do No good if you don&#39;t be). My birthday is the biggest regret of my life, but instead of dwelling into the past I want to make a beautiful future&#39;"
WjOowWxOXCg,@afootineachworld then what was the point? She might as well just stay home. You&#39;re making it more complicated for no reason at all other than equality... which means it isn&#39;t equality.
WjOowWxOXCg,"@afootineachworld because I factually makes sense the other way around... the mother has to take time off to have the baby. The company is forced to do all this extra work when you do it the other way around, when it just makes more logical sense to have the mother at home..."
WjOowWxOXCg,"@Cee Cee it&#39;s been statatically proven several times single motherhood is damaging to a child&#39;s health. It increases the likelihood of poverty and mentally damaging habits, the latter this exact video is trying to avoid..."
WjOowWxOXCg,@N3ppy you do know that male taxpayers pay for all that welfare leave right? Someone has to pay for the leave and welfare.
WjOowWxOXCg,@Captain Cook mummy issues...
WjOowWxOXCg,"This is literally their description:<br><br>&quot;Dealing with Attachment Issues:<br>Dealing with Attachment Issues is no easy task. For those who feel like they can’t help themselves, or can’t find trust through their partners of family, we recommend looking for professional support through a therapy.<br><br>If you are able to form a secure attachment to a therapist, he can become the one who provides you with that secure base. <br><br>Here three of possible therapies:<br><br>1. Psychoanalysis. The aim of psychoanalysis therapy is to release repressed emotions and experiences, i.e., make the unconscious conscious. In order to do that they therapist might try to bring back some childhood memories, to work at the root cause of the problem.<br><br>2. Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT). CBT is a psycho-social intervention that is widely used for improving mental health. Instead of trying to bring you back in time, it aims to explain you whats going on inside your brain and how to cope with irrational feelings or fears.<br><br>3. The Hoffmann Process. This 7-8 days guided process, designed by the American psychologist Hoffmann, brings participants back into their childhood to reconnect with their parents at the time when attachment is formed. Its very intensive.&quot;"
WjOowWxOXCg,How&#39;s that helping? Ihave gone into deep chaos...like a blackhole..i see no light or hope
WjOowWxOXCg,Perhaps talking with other people in similar situations?
WjOowWxOXCg,"&quot;Sorry mom, you did well&quot;"

WjOowWxOXCg,@takemypainaway No it&#39;s not hard....again your attitude causes you to stagnate...instead of saying it&#39;s hard...why not find out what you find hard and conquer it...put your energy into conquering and solutions rather then expressing what is wrong...for example someone may find it challenging to go swimming or drive so you sit down ask yourself why am I scared of swimming or driving what we&#39;re the first things I heard about swimming and driving...were they negative who taught me these things why do I panick...basically find the root and weed it out via reprogramming the mind...watch channels that conquer attitudes that teach this...ie tom bilyeu channel....look up how to conquer doubt fear worry etc...look up Ted talks...all the best...and change your vocabulary instead of saying it&#39;s hard it&#39;s difficult say it&#39;s challenging...some comments defeat you some empower you
WjOowWxOXCg,Betty Boo&#39;s Sister okay okay. I get it. But it IS hard. I never said it’s impossible. Just hard.
WjOowWxOXCg,@Andrea Brasher I wish
WjOowWxOXCg,Cedie Pili you are worthy
WjOowWxOXCg,"@Muhammad Faiyaz :,)"
WjOowWxOXCg,"It&#39;s never too late. If you are alive and reading this, then it&#39;s not late❤️"
WjOowWxOXCg,Yes that&#39;s it....
WjOowWxOXCg,@eggshells daycare is bad. It teaches your child that you will be away from them and unreliable when they grow up. This is why single parenthood is very VERY bad for future adults.
WjOowWxOXCg,i hope u doo 💗
WjOowWxOXCg,Snow Flakesx I have BPD so understand your fears.
WjOowWxOXCg,@Sarah Smile<br>The worry means you try and you care.  Those are the most important aspects of parenting in my opinion.
WjOowWxOXCg,Trying hard is 90% of the battle.  Good job.
WjOowWxOXCg,I&#39;m with you here. I worry I fall short of being a good mom but all I care about is being a good mom
WjOowWxOXCg,"Thank you, for being the change - rewriting your history into your own future."
WjOowWxOXCg,"Woah, your ability to reflect on your relationship is super cool. Right on! Sense of power and control is important to have, but you both shouldn’t rely too much on one another... I mean if it works it works! But perhaps, either of you will get tired of it and want some space separate from each other? It’s healthier to not be so joined at the hip. Go out and live your lives alone then come back together and share that trust with each other about your days."
WjOowWxOXCg,"I promise to myself that I will be a good mother to my future children. I will make sure they receive and feel the love they deserve. Didn&#39;t have a very happy or safe childhood, but I will give that to them."
WjOowWxOXCg,"Me too, do the opposite and have adult children that love you."
WjOowWxOXCg,"From what I&#39;ve heard, 3 out of 4 abused children continue the behaviour. 1 out of 4 go right the other way and end it. The Phelps family (of Westboro Baptist Church fame) exemplify this. 4 out of 13 of Fred Phelps&#39; kids turned on him and changed their behaviour. Look up Mark and Nate Phelps in particular."
WjOowWxOXCg,"Robyn - that&#39;s exactly what my mother believed. Boy, was she so wrong! I was shocked to read in her memoirs years later that she thought this, because it meant she had no idea at all who I was. She, too, believed she was &quot;doing the opposite of what her mother did&quot;. Don&#39;t judge your kids by what they do - just ask them. I hope you get the right answer."
WjOowWxOXCg,You&#39;re so right! What I say all the time is.. When I have kids of my own I&#39;m going to do every thing my  mom did not. And I&#39;m going take care of them and show them I love them. I&#39;m going to give them everything I didn&#39;t get. I&#39;m still 18 and it&#39;s a long way to go but I know I&#39;ll get there someday. I&#39;m so glad you made it. I&#39;m really happy for you. ❤️
WjOowWxOXCg,"@Amber Gardener Don&#39;t feel <i>anything</i> about it. Instead, take one last thorough look at it, then use your experiences as stepping stones to working your way out of it. It&#39;s possible."
WjOowWxOXCg,@8a41jt I don&#39;t know if I should feel good or bad about it
WjOowWxOXCg,"Oh no, not by any means. In fact, if you could peel the outer layers of appearances from most everyone you know, you&#39;d have a whole lot of company."

WjOowWxOXCg,Its often not as simple. We think many other things could play a role. Some genetic factors or sometimes a role we play within a healthy and wonderful family. If for example we are born the older brother we can feel jealous when a younger sibling arrives. If that happens during a critical time in our life - say very early - this can be a deeply traumatic experience to some. Even if the parents do their best to be there for both.

WjOowWxOXCg,"Hi Thais, thank you for your comment. Did you see the video in the original language or with a transcription? If yes, to which language? In English, it actually says &quot;primary caregiver&quot; which can be mother or father, grandparent, or someone else. That it actually is the mother in our example story is only a coincidence."
WjOowWxOXCg,Kids: the ultimate social experiment
WjOowWxOXCg,Do the opposite to what you life was like . I did☺
WjOowWxOXCg,Me too
WjOowWxOXCg,Just don&#39;t have kids then
WjOowWxOXCg,Awareness of the possibility of failure is the first step in avoiding it.
WjOowWxOXCg,"Thank you Alignment for the thoughtful respond. As you mentioned, the impacts on our personality are various and often not obvious. Attachment Theory is (only) a theory, that tries to explain some of our issues with having a healthy relationship to others when we grow up."

WjOowWxOXCg,"Ok, I will, if you feel sorry for me too"
WjOowWxOXCg,"Robin B, That’s a very true point you make. Intimate relationship is the new “domestic violence” label because it can include power complexes- not just child and caregiver or parent but siblings, other familiar relationships."
WjOowWxOXCg,That&#39;s happened to me my dad and mom delt with some form of abuse and they ended up abusing me physically and verbally for about two years because of my mom having depression and my dad stressing over work those 2 2 events were kind of the catalyst for those 2 years.

WjOowWxOXCg,Same
WjOowWxOXCg,OkinInc thank you! You’re right! Thank you !
WjOowWxOXCg,Kristen Lee 😂 Don’t dwell on the past. Live for today to see tomorrow my friend. We can look for answers through blame or a reason from yesterday but it takes up too much time. Get on with being you. You are AMAZING. 🤙🏻
WjOowWxOXCg,"Of course they are. In fact, the theory is based on „primary caregivers“ regardless of wether they are dads, moms, uncles, aunts, or grandparents. We just stocked to the mom to simply. I am sorry that we have hurt your feelings. We didn’t intend to. Ps: you have an great husband and obviously a wonderful dad."
WjOowWxOXCg,"Thank you for sharing your story, it is great that you found confidence in yourself! All the best to you and your family!"
WjOowWxOXCg,"Redamazulu- It probably has to do with the fact that this actually happened and is still happening. Maybe people will see how crazy and unjustified it is if they see it spoken plainly. It should be shocking because it is, yet so many swallowed it because it didn’t directly implicate themselves. <br><br>Yet you’re not like that and it gives me hope."
WjOowWxOXCg,"@Box Elder even rereading it, it still sounds serious.  Maybe an edit or update?  :)"
WjOowWxOXCg,Redamazulu - What’s sad is that was supposed to be sarcasm but the word is so messed up now that people think I am serious.
WjOowWxOXCg,@Box Elderyou do realize that those &quot;...people they deemed burdensome on society and got some killin’ done!&quot; were Jewish and many were employed or business owners themselves.  You &quot;example&quot; is assinine.
WjOowWxOXCg,"Avella - True. People we cannot afford or care for have no right to exist. I think Hitler called them “Useless Eaters”, or maybe he got that phrase from Margaret Sanger, I can’t remember. At any rate they lined up all the people they deemed burdensome on society and got some killin’ done!"
WjOowWxOXCg,Thank you Dr. Shawna Freshwater for the citations and advise!
WjOowWxOXCg,😂😂😂😂😂
WjOowWxOXCg,"Hi Smile, of course not everything is nurture, much is also nature. I really don´t know what you suffer from. You may lack certain hormons that usually create certain important emotions or you could also have too much of them, these usually can be treated very effectfully with medication. But in any case you could try out meeting someone professional to talk to and share your issues with. This can sometimes help more than we ever expected. All the best for you!"
WjOowWxOXCg,"I&#39;m sorry Selena, I also had to experience my parents fighting a lot. They are damaged themselves and probably have no cure, be at a safe distance from them. Many people have kids for selfish reasons or by accident, it&#39;s not our fault as children and very unjust, one or both of them can be suffering from a personality disorder like narcisism or worse. I hope you can break the family pattern with a lot of studying and psychological healing to avoid repeating it."
WjOowWxOXCg,The same. The best thing to do is to avoid them and live your life. That is what I am starting to do. It makes you feel so much at peace.
WjOowWxOXCg,look up malignant narcissism ..The Little Shaman on YouTube explains narcissism in detail.
WjOowWxOXCg,"@eggshells That&#39;s not precisely the case, most people just want to have children, the peer pressure argument is only valid for those who are single or don&#39;t desire children."

WjOowWxOXCg,As an Asian that was never a thing.
WjOowWxOXCg,I had this also with hugs. I remember maybe three times I was hugged during my whole childhood and teen years. Now that I know I dont miss the chance! But I still strugle with hugging women because my mom was super cold. If my mum hugs me now I tense up so bad and I feel disgust.😖
WjOowWxOXCg,When ever I complain to my dad that why my  friends parents are so nice to them he said that something&#39;s wrong me

WjOowWxOXCg,thanks!
WjOowWxOXCg,That&#39;s so sad.
WjOowWxOXCg,"Securely attached is healthy. It doesn&#39;t mean that someone gets hurt easily because they will seek out healthy relationships and they are not naive because of their secure attachment (of course, you can be naive per your personality, attachment is just one part of the puzzle of psychology). Insecurely attached people tend to enter abusive relationships, so they get hurt."

WjOowWxOXCg,"Hi D, i totally hope so too. And I am positive. I am sure what you gave your children in the first years has a longterm influence on their development.

WjOowWxOXCg,@Ruchi Kameshwar hi my brother committed suicide 2 days after he&#39;d made that comment. I apologise for the dismay.
WjOowWxOXCg,@Mii 2.0 also no expert but if u have a negative goal you most probably will reach it easily but it wont do u any good. Try seeking out a therapist. It will help put ur mind on ease and u can think of better ways to earn money and improve your living conditions
WjOowWxOXCg,@Mii 2.0  they didn&#39;t think their story is sad. But what they went through was hell for them. In these kinds of situations not everyone is grateful someone is worseoff than them. The op was just trying to share something that im sure they have bottled up for many years and from what they said they are improvising .Never think anyones sorrow is lesser than your own. In fact its good that u too shared your story  because beleive it or not sharing does help decrease the mental burden just a little. Again im not telling u off im just stating that your 1st sentence kind of ticked me off
WjOowWxOXCg,"Attachment theory is only one part of the puzzle... there is also things that happended outside the family and simply DNA, too. Maybe bad luck, also... Hope you have better luck in the future."

WjOowWxOXCg,Christina Cathryn I was kind of like an orphan. When my parents divorced I didn’t live with either of them and equally devalued them. From 10 to 14. 14 I then lived with my mom again since she was ready to do so. I’m gifted and I did terrible in school with 0 support

WjOowWxOXCg,@8a41jt yeah that joke keeps coming until I&#39;m 26 now. I came back to this comment which I left 2 years ago. I feel thankful to read all replies in here. But my ears are trained to not to listen to those anymore. I feel motivated to achieve my dreams more than before. :)

WjOowWxOXCg,"@Sprouts Thank you so much for your reply, I didn&#39;t expect one at all! Your theory is very interesting and is something I hadn&#39;t considered before. I mean I feel so sure that I want the person I love to love me back but can&#39;t help asking myself whether that&#39;s a selfish thing to want (which, logically I know it&#39;s not). At the same time I do have the fear that everyone who likes me only does so because they actually only know me on the surface, but that if someone were to see the true depth of who I am as a person, they wouldn&#39;t be able to handle it and would quit. :/<br>Thank you for the advice for different kind of therapy. I&#39;ve been feeling the need for therapy for a while now. I&#39;m also a person who likes to think and analyse things philosophically so maybe trying a new approach would be effective. I&#39;ll see if I can find something.<br>Thank you again!"
WjOowWxOXCg,"Hi Karrie, thank you so much for your honest and open comment. You say you might need your partners too much, which scares them away, and in the same time you don´t give them space to build up a longing for you. This might be only bad luck with finding the right partner. But if you see a pattern in it, so one way to look at it is that maybe you don´t want your partner to really long for you? Maybe you are afraid of the closeness and intimacy that could be there if someone loved you back as strong as you did. A strong love from both partners is potentially also creating a high risk for losing oneself or each other - at least thats what we fear, especially if we are insecurely attached, or experienced trauma in our relationships to people we love a lot. And that fear might keep you away from letting it happen. But as I mentioned before, maybe I am totally wrong and you just didn´t meet the right guy yet? We really can not know. About therapy- I personally gained a lot from physical therapies, like Alexander Technique or Feldenkrais. It works on the emotional/physical patterns that we take on through out our life on a unconscious level, and since I anyways like to analyse everything and to try to solve issues with my head, the physical approach went much deeper for me. I hope I could help you a tiny bit and wish you all the best!"
WjOowWxOXCg,Thank you for your insights!
WjOowWxOXCg,"@maythecatbewithyou another theory/excuse. I&#39;m not saying what is being explained here has no grounds for being correct. Personally I worry about making people feel insecure about things like this when they&#39;ve already overcome them. And of course some coping mechanisms people develop later in life can be destructive, but it is very likely that someone who views this video will finally realize there&#39;s something wrong and consequently enter a very destructive mode instead of asking for help. You can decide which one is more likely to happen. But from experience videos like this don&#39;t help everyone. And this is just my &quot;unpopular&quot; opinion."
WjOowWxOXCg,"The great value of this theory does not lie in blaming people for damage already done, but in educating parents in order to prevent it - especially when you consider that before this theory came out it was considered to be good parenting by many to &#39;toughen up&#39; kids by denying them love: &quot;Never hug and kiss them, never let them sit on your lap. If you must, kiss them once on the forehead when they say goodnight. Shake hands with them in the morning. Give them a pat on the head if they have made an extraordinary good job of a difficult task&quot; (Psychological Care of Infant and Child by John B. Watson)"

WjOowWxOXCg,He’s going to be lonely old man one day. Although maybe he already is... Thanks for sharing your story and all the best for the time when you get to move out and leave this sick man! 🙏
WjOowWxOXCg,I was raised by gangs. Fight me.
WjOowWxOXCg,"Isn&#39;t this a sweeping generalisation of what they said?<br><br>When they talk about &#39;fixing yourself&#39;, I highly doubt that they are talking about genetic illnesses, like schizophrenia, so I think the lost leg analogy is false.<br><br>I&#39;m also sure that &#39;can&#39;t raise them then don&#39;t have them&#39; isn&#39;t aimed at people who who have already been raising them and then experience a death in the family, causing issues with raising them."
WjOowWxOXCg,"@lemsip i love your username! 😊 could def use a hot cuppa lemsip atm lol<br>Hey i have been wondering the same and I experience exactly tye same...🤔 really scratching my head on this. Is it because one is too self-aware or concious about it that so much focus and attention goes into striving etc?<br>The more I try or once I decide to do something or set my mind to something all of those plans are wrecked and something else shows up and Im stuck on a loop, however positive or positive thinking or law of attraction etc. i do...im literally losing it now because i dont know what to do or how to think to turn things around...perhaps its a matter of doing ones best &amp; just letting go and see where it floats down the stream"
WjOowWxOXCg,"Yes, exactly. I had depression, i took some medicine and don&#39;t need It anymore, but i still have social fobia, i AM so anxious about everything, i can&#39;t do anything. Still, I am really smart, if i wasn&#39;t so fucked up i would have a beautiful future, i never did alcohol or drugs, but my illness hold me back from life."
WjOowWxOXCg,"Marvelous Quasar Pork Man  My experience affirms this. Repeating mental affirmations that your emotional soul does not agree with sets up a conflicting dichotomy that will test weak if you apply kinesiology testing as you say the affirmation. Four years ago I discovered <a href=""http://divinetruth.com/"">divinetruth.com</a> videos and have finally learned how to release error feeling beliefs that the child self holds onto and will sabotage any affirmations contrary to what it still feels is true.  Intellectual insights do not change the feeling soul.  I did 25 years of talk therapy that gave me a truckload of insights, but very little emotional release at the child self level. The soul needs to be allowed to express itself emotionally. I call it emoting work."
WjOowWxOXCg,"Marvelous Quasar Pork Man- I was thinking more along the lines of if you had a belief that says, “I always mess things up, I am worthless.” Then you work on a new belief that is closer to the truth. While you may be feeling like a worthless screwup, the truth is that there are things you mostly do well and your worth is not based on your latest mistake. When I recognize I am feeling like a worthless screwup I find it helps to reinforce the new and more positive beliefs. This changes my thinking patterns, that changes my emotions, in turn it helps me take more positive action, that leads to better results."
WjOowWxOXCg,thanks!

WjOowWxOXCg,"@Sherlock Holmes If you build your life on weak basis it will eventually fall.

WjOowWxOXCg,You are totally right- the father is an absolutely central figure in the family. In our video example  the father died and the mother is left alone and overwhelmed by the new situation.

WjOowWxOXCg,"No child has been an adult, an adult has been a child, teaching the children at young age is the best. But we only learn once we grow older, so naturally we need adults to teach us properly, but more times than not it&#39;s the same thing as the children have been trying to express."
WjOowWxOXCg,"Mary Ainsworth was John Bowlby&#39;s student, they both pioneered attachment theory."
WjOowWxOXCg,"As a baby, you don&#39;t have peers. Most of our brain is formed in our first two years - even in the womb. How your mother interacts with you, and even the stress she experiences while pregnant, is more important than a mean or kind kid at kindergarten."
WjOowWxOXCg,"Attachment is very important and can shape the way we understand the world but it doesn&#39;t define who we are. Emotionally strong experiences, either positive or negative, and important figures in our life can change our thinking pattern and &quot;change&quot; our attachment style."
WjOowWxOXCg,"The &quot;attachment&quot; in question forms specifically during infancy, and is a direct result from interaction between said infant and their primary caregiver. Issues such as peers and safe neighborhoods arise well after an attachment style has formed."
WjOowWxOXCg,"The attachment theory only applies to the first 3 years of your life. Of course we are affected and shaped by the things we experience and our environment later on, however the first 3 years of your life that form your earliest neurological pathways, shape whatever we experience later."
WjOowWxOXCg,Agreed! My kindergarten teacher was verbally abusive and this affected me a lot.
WjOowWxOXCg,Moral of the story is learn how to PROPERLY raise children. You could have 1 kid and they’ll end fucked up vs a family with 4 who has a stable family or parent.
WjOowWxOXCg,@Mona Lisa usually they stop at just one - as a meal ticket. You want a real family? You have to at least give your kid a sibling or two....only children (ie; kids with no brothers or sisters) can be entitled and self-important
WjOowWxOXCg,"@EvaMira So you&#39;d want to raise a kid in a future in which our Earth could possibly be destroyed by our own greed? You want them to grow up in that? Can you not do shit on your own, you need kids to do it for you? <br><br>I am tired of hearing people brag about how they have kids and saying it&#39;s &quot;natural&quot;. You don&#39;t NEED to have them, we as humans know that. People have this odd impulse to constantly follow societal trends, even if it causes them distress."

WjOowWxOXCg,"I agree with you that making the decision that you truly want to be happy would greatly change evrything in your life. I didnt have abusive parents, but I got depressed and had so many regrets, I was blaming myself. One time I just decided that I want to be happt and so I did. I took note of the negative traits I have, and started to change it everyday. Basically one thing that helped me most is self awareness amd balance."

WjOowWxOXCg,"People who don&#39;t trust should seek out psychological help, it necessary for a person&#39;s well-being to trust well-meaning people. What you might be thinking of is people who enter relationships with people who don&#39;t mean well, but that is not because they are too trusting, if you are healthy, you will find out rather easily who to trust."
WjOowWxOXCg,I think being born premature and being in a incubator  probably explains why. Myself  and other premiees I&#39;ve talked to are more easily worried less socially engaged and introverted and are   more easily neurotic.  Since we where in incubators  separated from contact and obviously  not being fully developed.
WjOowWxOXCg,"@8a41jt that benefit is funded through your taxes.  Most places have a maximum benefit to be paid monthly and you have to have a minimum number of hours employed before you can access them.  In essence, you&#39;re funding your own maternity leave.   It&#39;s a shame how some feel it&#39;s ok for their taxes to go to a war machine but not to benefit them in any other way."
WjOowWxOXCg,"As a mom, I am so glad that in the first 2-3 years of my children&#39;s lives, I was there with everything I had bc at the time I could be emotionally, physically, mentally,  &amp; life circumstances did not hinder me. We were blessed for that. I began teaching them independence as they grew. My life now is in a difficult spot and I can&#39;t give them the same love &amp; even attention as I would like for now. Not that it would look like that of a baby, but better than it currently is. Thankfully, they seem to believe &amp; understand that I love them and it&#39;s a temporary struggle. Not saying they do not act out in frustration at times, but they allow me to love them through it. I could NEVER let my mom love me at their age. I felt too uncomfortable by then, but I never knew why. My boys are 13, 6. &amp; my youngest just turned 5 last week."
WjOowWxOXCg,@eggshells I do realize. Is the main reason why except for certain religious groups most of society in eurasia is dying. The number of babies is so small . The thing is for society to survive you need 3 kids per woman. And despite feminist motivational speaches a woman should have the kids before 30. Otherwise either she will not have any or there is a really high probability that they will have severe health issues during their entire life. Also believe or not 90% of women having careers is a bad thing. Generally they are severely under  performing but are kept for fer of lawsuits and for a family if you count the expenses for the woman to have a job too vs staying at home you will realize the amount accounts to almost or even more than she makes. While there are exceptions what I said is true for the big majority of women. That standard is extremely bad. Unless you want to return to mud huts tribes over 75% of women should renounce the idea of a career and stay home and have kids. Ironically they can make more net money (money left after job related expenses) from working from home or starting a home business than having a career as a corporate slave.

WjOowWxOXCg,Psycho Analysis works for some
WjOowWxOXCg,Bryan Dott same here
WjOowWxOXCg,@Carlotta Quensel there are certainly bad parents around who did want tp have their kids! You can want them for the wrong reasons.
WjOowWxOXCg,"EricTalwin yes and the introduction is something we were educated about in sociology in high school, that higher educated people over analyze and end up with less kids than careless people who just go with it. Thus there are far more lower educated people on earth."
WjOowWxOXCg,"@**** If you spend so much time trying to get everything perfect to have a kid that you actually run out of time to have one, you have clearly missed the point, planned poorly, fixated on the wrong things, and you probably wouldn&#39;t have been a very good parent anyways. Mostly for those reasons. Kids just need you, a roof, and a plumbing system if you don&#39;t want CPS on your butt. Everything else can be worked out, made, donated, dealt with, saved for, and/or gifted. <br>If you don&#39;t want kids, that&#39;s fine. If you want kids don&#39;t waste your life trying to make things so perfect you miss out on what you really wanted. And if you do that then just adopt a kid or something. Geez, we live in 2019, you don&#39;t have to be childless just because you ran out of eggs at home."
WjOowWxOXCg,Not having kids is kind of good for the planet
WjOowWxOXCg,Have you seen the movie Idiocracy?
WjOowWxOXCg,@Siddharth Singh The LOA is what ever you want it to be. You create your own reality.
WjOowWxOXCg,"There is no power in holding someone else responsible for your thoughts.. Your greatest gift is the imagination, only you can imagine travelling round the world first class. I can&#39;t do it for you."
WjOowWxOXCg,The LOA is a hoax
WjOowWxOXCg,"I disagree, you&#39;re not responsible for your thoughts."
WjOowWxOXCg,agree
WjOowWxOXCg,"No, it is about the relationship to the primary caregiver. This does not have to be the mother."
WjOowWxOXCg,At least one. More are great.
WjOowWxOXCg,"Smithieboy I so agree with you. It&#39;s heartbreaking  to think of children. through no fault of anyone&#39;s, inheriting a personality disorder. The best we can do is to understand it otherwise we stress out trying to change things. and that is one huge waste of effort, as I&#39;m sure you know.."
WjOowWxOXCg,Your mother and sisters most probably inherited the&#39;&#39; anti social personality disorder&#39;&#39; gene. or one of the other personality disorders...  If you research this condition you&#39;ll get to understand why they are like that and knowledge is power. Then just let it go..

WjOowWxOXCg,"This is normal. We just stared my 16 month old in dayacre and everyday it is crying when I leave him. I am so guilt ridden and I always knew in my gut this is not ok, a baby needs to be with his mother at least until he&#39;s around 2-3. I have no choice but to return to work, my husband cannot afford to put a roof over our head. I&#39;m now depressed that putting my baby is gonna reck him for life. Dear lord help me."
WjOowWxOXCg,"Trust me your child is very normal. In Germany we usually take 14 days of settling in for new children to accept their new friends and teachers at a daycare. During those days (some kids need a month) the mom is around. First the entire time, later less. Even the most securely attached 2 year old needs time to built strong bonds to new people."
WjOowWxOXCg,"@Pamela Norton I was with my both grandparents since year one because I was their first grandchild in 1990. Funny thing was they tried to return me to my parents&#39; place about 30km away but every time they do it one week after I got fever (always). So, my biological parents will bring me again to my grandparents&#39; place and I will be healthy again. So I stayed with my grandparents until ma and pa decided to reside here in Manila. I stayed with lo and la until college. After graduation, I live with my parents and manages small business since 2012. Good morning Pam. :)"
WjOowWxOXCg,wilderness and me Same thing: how did you attach to your grandparents? Were they there for you? Could you count on them? What’s complicated is your relationship to your biological mother and father. Were you always with your grandparents or did you know your parents first? Or later?
WjOowWxOXCg,@underworld angel You are extremely lucky. My parents are members of a criminal syndicate. And they sometimes try to kill me.
WjOowWxOXCg,"@Maisie Moby PLEASE MOVE OUT, <b><i>NOW!!!</i></b> NOT WHEN YOU&#39;RE 17, NOT WHEN YOU&#39;RE AN ADULT, <b><i>NOW!!!</i></b>"
WjOowWxOXCg,"Im guessing ur 15/16. Im speaking from experience, at 15/16 I hated myself, and the world. Teen years lived with a bad mindset and dropping out of school at 16. Now I just turned 18, and I love myself. I love my mind, my heart, my physical body. I know my worth, and know what Im here for. It took years of self isolation and self hatred for me to realize my true potential tho so dont lose hope seriously. All you need is love (for yourself) and it will bleed into everything u do."
WjOowWxOXCg,"One step at a time. Don&#39;t lose faith. Come to terms with everything you&#39;ve endured and realize its not your fault. Changing your mindset, turning negative thoughts into positive ones. Look at everything from all perspectives. Accept. Find healthy coping mechanisms that work for you (exercise, art, writing), get to know yourself, what you&#39;re good at or love. Turn it into hobby, job. Learn to love YOURSELF FIRST. And remember things don&#39;t change overnight. This life is yours and you only have one so you want to live it best right?"
WjOowWxOXCg,"Psychotherapy is used to treat mental disorders, including social anxiety. Therapists are legally required to keep the conversation you have secret, so if to decide to see a therapist, you don&#39;t have to worry telling them anything that&#39;s bothering you."

WjOowWxOXCg,It doesn&#39;t and doesn&#39;t intend to. It describes tendencies.

WjOowWxOXCg,"I am the youngest in my family, and the only female, and also queer, and my siblings are much older than me. My mother is very conservative. I live in a country that has a conservative society. So I have so much odds stacked against me. <br><br>My mum was very strict towards me when I was 13. My mother would not understand me if I be myself. My mother never asked me about my interests, she never treated like a friend to me, she never tried to understand me, she tried to control me instead when I was in younger levels of secondary school, or in sec school in general, she never had warm conversations until I was in polytechnic, after secondary school. By then, I found those conversations weird and too late for me to have warm conversations with her. And I thought I have to be strong so I didnt express much to her.  <br><br>When in secondary school, I had no freedom of thought. I was afraid of not only my mother, but also my classmates, who were bullies, and the teachers. <br><br>In the years of secondary school, with the stress of studies, I didn&#39;t know how to express well and essays were actually a pain coz I have to express well and write well. <br><br>It was only a few times in those years of hellhole in secondary school that someone / few people treated me like a friend. I don&#39;t know if I liked it in those moments, or I found it weird coz I have never actualy been treated like a friend by anyone <br><br>Even in polytechnic, I couldn&#39;t express well. I was still afraid of what my mum said if I did certain things because I joined some CCAs. Even if I could what I wanna do, I held back because I was afraid of what my mum would say. <br><br>I had more freedom of thought but still little, and was still afraid of things and I couldn&#39;t get out of it for some reason. <br><br>In polytechnic, I was so religious, dumb in a way, naive and too worried about the future, even though I was in a school that is a relaxed kind of environment, the pace is slower, the environment makes it that you feel you want to learn. But what doesn&#39;t change is my mum is still there, religion doesn&#39;t change; the preachers would say certain things and I had to follow, and the society is still conservative. So I had to continue restricting, oppressing and being harsh on myself even though I knew I shouldn&#39;t do it. <br><br>I grew up to be an anxious avoidant person because I couldn&#39;t form strong bonds with people, heck, I didn&#39;t actually make many friends in polytechnic because I knew I would not make strong bonds. Even with the close friends I had, I could not share my personal thoughts because I worry they would not understand me or they would judge me. But I didn&#39;t want to go deep because it would be deep and I didn&#39;t want to deal with feelings.  <br><br>One day in polytechnic, I went through a crisis and I became the reverse. I became less religious, rebellious over time, demanding and rude to my parents and disorganised over time. <br><br>Now I want to recover but I still want to rebel and be a bad person even though the so many times I experienced and told myself I should not.<br><br>This is why being a friend to your child is important. This is why good parenting is important. This is why disciplining your child is not always the best 1st option."
WjOowWxOXCg,I’m in therapy for this and knowing this is the reason for relationship problems etc in my life I can change things now. I’m pretty excited about that. Scapegoat children usually do well because they break free from toxic families. Good luck!

WjOowWxOXCg,"@Slim Jim You also couldn&#39;t find someone you trusted like a good therapist or mental health pro to give you what you need to overcome.  It is tough, I know. Trying to find one and all will take up your time.  You are doing the right thing by making this a priority in the 1st place!!!  That takes bravery and guts..."
WjOowWxOXCg,"@Slim Jim Yes, I understand the lack of control in those situations, but it&#39;s still an illusion the mind and feelings try to come up with to keep the full experience of emotions and the full grasp of the realization out of reach. It&#39;s just something you have to learn to cope with and survive through I believe. I&#39;ve tried counseling occasionally and for very brief periods of time, bit O honestly do better alone or in standing with my own beliefs, practices (aka talking, praying to God), and self reflection and study versus an outsider trying to condition or help me in the ways they see fit. I am also suffering from depression and have been for sometime, but I believe if God will send you to it, He&#39;ll pull you through it. Everything happens for a reason, it&#39;s learning that sometimes I may never fully understand why....and in return that is ultimately okay....for I am only human as we all are. Take care and good luck with your struggles, I wish you the best. 🤝"

WjOowWxOXCg,"Are you outspoken, an extrovert, and socially-acceptably slim? You may have a role here. Being passive may be helped by finding activities that interest her, even just to watch. (Like skating, and not like TV I mean). Shy is just a way of being. People who are shy may be thinking zillions of thoughts, just not into sharing like an aggressive or extroverted person might. &quot;Overweight,&quot;--in whose estimation?<br><br>Never mention anyone&#39;s size to her--disparaging people by how they look is likely to make her critical rather than friendly with people. Does your daughter show interest in being active and learning to prepare healthy food choices? Do you prepare and eat meals together? Do you purchase food, like chips, cookies, pop, that replace choices like protein, milk products, fruit and vegetables, in your grocery cart? <br><br>You characterise your daughter as &quot;passive, shy, overweight.&quot; Find other words to describe her--funny?, caring?, helpful?, so that you are not &quot;stuck&quot; (you can be characterised as &quot;stuck&quot;). You wanted to see your &quot;first child born&quot; (do you have others?). Why? Just curious? Or, because you hoped to help her learn to be a fully-functioning, self-loving person? Someone happy to love you because you care so much about her and the community that is helping to raise her?<br><br>Your oldest daughter is possibly fine. Look elsewhere for your feelings (that she is passive, shy &amp; overweight). Why do you feel this way?"
WjOowWxOXCg,You may also want to look up how stress affects the unborn child.  I read in child development that children born to a mother under stress while pregnant are more likely to be aggressive.
WjOowWxOXCg,Mary Ainsworth did a study to measure attachment referred to as &quot;Strange Situation.&quot;
WjOowWxOXCg,Not necessarily. My mom wasn’t married and I turned out to be very stable and secure person.
WjOowWxOXCg,More like a stable income
WjOowWxOXCg,"@Generally Uninterested Great Parents is the first part, Good moral instruction and interactions is the second, <b>But the child&#39;s personal choices is the final part</b> . Kids still have agency, and they need to CHOOSE to do what&#39;s right, once they know what &quot;right&quot; is. There are also a bunch of other factors that can greatly affect a person&#39;s life outcomes beyond their personal choices (i.e. genetics; you mentioned possible ADHD;undiagnosed social conditions are a big deal and can certainly have an impact down the road.)"
WjOowWxOXCg,"not necessarily true! I was raised in stable marriage (great mom and dad) but I&#39;ve seen them argue/fight through out the years and even witness their discussion about divorce (i was 6), was abused physically by my cousin for YEARS and still sometimes with my parents knowledge cause they can&#39;t do anything saying she doesn&#39;t have parents which shouldn&#39;t excuse her behavior but wwid! Anyway my point is I may seem normal outside (for my parent&#39;s sake) but I&#39;m really fucked in the head lol"
WjOowWxOXCg,You could be on a spectrum between types I guess. But the idea is that it should be pretty clear whether you are securely attached or not.
WjOowWxOXCg,"I know exactly what you mean! And I was thinking this the whole time while watching the video! My parental situation is just like the first story @ <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjOowWxOXCg&amp;t=1m57s"">1:57</a> , my father died and now all I have is my mother.....except they weren&#39;t together, but I have a complete secure attachment to my mother...and yet....I have a negative self image and I don&#39;t make friends so easily...I think it has something to do with how much of a meek person I am!! It sucks being that person everyone see&#39;s as &quot;too nice&quot; while being in a world full of chesty, egotistic people ....it&#39;s just who I turned out to be and it sucks, I&#39;d honestly give anything to be that outgoing confident person :&#39;( ...so just because I have that secure attachment to a parent it doesn&#39;t necessarily mean I&#39;ll be better off in life or even have better personality traits than others. This theory is saying you can either be this, this, or this...its definitely not always true."
WjOowWxOXCg,Patterns can be recognized however.

WjOowWxOXCg,"Sam Sırri <br>There it is, the magic word: statistics. ‘That means surely it must be science and be taken seriously’. Statistics nowadays are criminally overrated and taken too literally (I say this as a physics student), most people don’t really understand how they work.<br>Statistics first of all can be interpretated in a dozen of ways, ESPECIALLY in psychology. This is just one interpretation by one psychologist that apparently a lot of people seemed to agree with. Psychology is for a big part just speculation (not to say I don’t take it seriously).<br>Secondly, people need to think logically first before grabbing to statistics. There are plenty examples of people not fitting into any of these boxes including myself."
WjOowWxOXCg,@Sam Sırri yep! and I&#39;m pretty sure even the more variable cases can be mapped out..
WjOowWxOXCg,"There&#39;s a difference between not being gullible and feeling prosecuted and unsafe all the time though. I think generally our society is actually quite safe and most of the time nothing bad happens to people. Yet people who are not securely attached <i>constantly</i> feel unsafe. What&#39;s more, children internalise the relationship(s) they had with their caretakers in their first years. If these relationships were full of ambivalence, violence, emotional neglect, etc. these children will grow up to become adults that have internalised these attitudes towards themselves. They now treat themselves in that same way and expect others to treat them that way (and often cannot see the degree to which this is projected by them as opposed to actual). This makes for a terrible way to live. I can attest to that. I&#39;m myself still in the process of overcoming this."
WjOowWxOXCg,"Typically healthy attached children rather be with the caregiver than a stranger, where’s in some situations, the insecurely attached child will seek out the attention of strangers or not be scared of them."
WjOowWxOXCg,"@Jilligain Well that&#39;s a cheerful attitude 😕 lol I was brought up in a VERY sheltered life (born and raised Mormon 7th generation) at a time Mormons didn&#39;t allow people of color to join the preisthood &amp; raised halfway between SLC &amp; Provo up until 1978 I had never met anyone outside of my parents faith or other than cocasion but as soon as I moved to Alabama I pretty much fit right in. Life is what you make of it choose your fights keep looking forward &amp; if you see someone without a smile, give em&#39; yours😊"
WjOowWxOXCg,"That&#39;s not what this is about... It&#39;s about being optimistic, relaxed, having good self esteem, being able to develop good and lasting relationships, etc. As in opposed to being insecure, anxious, stressed, depressed and lonely. You can fit in the first example AND have a realistic view of the world."
WjOowWxOXCg,"the video doesnt say they know the world is safe, they think so. they slowly learn where its not, while trying things and proving the things that are safe.. on the other hand, the unattached child sees everything is unsafe, and does not try anything. they never prove themselves wrong and remain fearful. it doesnt mean attached children feel safe sitting in the middle of the road. look at things with some perspective.."
WjOowWxOXCg,"If a child is clingy he or she is probably insecurely attached, it only seems as if the bond is too strong. If the bond were actually strong, then the child wouldn&#39;t need to fear leaving the mother, because he/she knew she&#39;d always still be there."
WjOowWxOXCg,"Suzanne&#39;s Vlogs you are facing the true about your mistakes, very few people have the courage to do that. You are on the right track, a problem can only be fixed when it’s identified."
WjOowWxOXCg,"Suzanne&#39;s Vlogs Wow I really admire that you can see your part in this, I think that shows you really are good parent. I’m sorry to hear about his dad, maybe there’s some underlying trauma in that. Unless he’s had it already I suggest he goes to therapy"
WjOowWxOXCg,"You were not responsible for his fathers death and so you are not guilty for your reaction to this sad incidence. Don&#39;t feel guilty. Since you very aware of what has happened, I have great faith that you will find ways to supports your son to stand on his own feet and built meaningful relationships. When the time comes, trust him and I&#39;ll trust others."
WjOowWxOXCg,My son is very close to me as we lost his dad to cancer when he was ten. I think 🤔 I have over protected him and he’s now suffering with social anxiety. The guilt ways heavy on me😒. We can’t do right for doing wrong.

WjOowWxOXCg,no this story doesn&#39;t particularly blames the mother but the society that blames the mother if just one day she can&#39;t prepare a proper lunch.. but if the father cooks a meal  just once a year that is celebrated. i am not blaming the father or mother.. as we raise kids we inspire our girls to overcome every boundary inspire them to be a pilot and but we fail to raise our boys properly we fail to inspire them to share the responsibility of being a caregiver .
WjOowWxOXCg,@noobenstein she&#39;s referring to the studies only examing children&#39;s relationships to their mothers and saying it&#39;s the mother child relationship that has affected the attachment style of the child.

WjOowWxOXCg,"@Vj Grimes Yes mam you&#39;re right. I know how it feels and you know, childhood has a lifelong impact on our personalities.

WjOowWxOXCg,"But as a parent?, or seeking a loving relationship, you are armed and ready, because of your understanding gained from this attachment theory stuff.

WjOowWxOXCg,“Just stop having children.” i don’t think that’s the only solution or the best solution. Maybe we should just consider having less kids or  more adoptions at the very least. There are alternatives to not having children that we can also focus on in order to improve the world. Hopefully you’re actually proactive in trying to improve the world and you aren’t just advocating in the comment section and hopefully “stop having children” isn’t your only solution.

WjOowWxOXCg,"I also grew up afraid of the world. My mom always says to me that I am easily manipulated. I always grew up with bad social anxiety/anxiety. And was very insecure on the way I’ve looked what I would say, therefore most the time I wouldn’t say how I felt or anything at all because of the way I thought people would look at me were view me. For chrissakes my mom even had me afraid of black people. Which yes we did live in a veryll I also grew up afraid of the world. My mom always says to me that I am easily manipulated. I always grew up with bad social anxiety/anxiety. And was very insecure on the way I looked what I would say, therefore most the time I wouldn’t say how I felt or anything at all because of the way I thought people would look at me or view me. For chrissakes my mom even had me afraid of black people. Which yes I did grow up in a very small town with only three red lights right outside of Jacksonville Florida. I would pray at night to the Lord that he wouldn’t allow any bad people to get me and pray for my family and friends. I still remember that prayer. I ended up once turning 18 turning to drugs and alcohol. That lasted a devastating 10 years of my life that I don’t remember. I don’t like pointing the fingers or blaming anyone for anything, but I know that if it Weren’t for the way my mother raised me as a single parent yes but still raise me to believe my dad was a piece of shit abbreviation mar weren’t for the way my mother raised me as a single parent yes but still raise me to believe my dad was a piece of shit, (and later I found out that was exactly what he was, when doing Drugs together he pulled out his private parts..) long story.. my dad has even resulted in asking me to send him naked pictures. Which in my eyes is disgusting and pathetic but I understand he is on drugs and he is an alcoholic therefore he doesn’t view me as his own child. There’s a lot of things I haven’t told my therapist but I’m wondering if anyone here can relate? There’s a lot more to the story but I’m on seven different medications, most of them are for anxiety and mood stabilizers, antidepressants, along with my ADHD medication. I don’t like pointing fingers like I said but the only thing I can think that stems from me being the way I am today a recovering addict/alcoholic and still going through anxiety and ups and downs in my life sometimes even hating myself, I’d leave stems from the way my mother raised me. Any advice?"
WjOowWxOXCg,"@Mona Lisa it&#39;s scientifically proven that unhealthy attachments stunt developments emotionally and physically, in the brain. Hence the reason for sociopaths. They didn&#39;t form attachments early on. So nks reply is far from empowering. It doesn&#39;t do any help at all. It&#39;s blaming. Didn&#39;t you watch the video? It bluntly said that attachments, healthy or unhealthy, form a person&#39;s outlook and health later on in life."
WjOowWxOXCg,I sympathize with you...maybe its financial...love may be there...but on and off...my mom was wonderful when I was ill...but hated to see me sad or crying....

WjOowWxOXCg,"In this case, you&#39;ve been pulled away from your &quot;stable core&quot;.

WjOowWxOXCg,"The attachment theory only applies to the first 3 years of your life. There are of course other factors that determine and shape your emotional life, however the first 3 years of your life are extremely significant to your inerrant nature. Hope that makes sense."
WjOowWxOXCg,Similar past childhood experiences and the same psychological outcome with me too.
WjOowWxOXCg,That&#39;s not necessarily your attachment styles changing. Your attachment styles is something that would be assessed at a young age that&#39;s only one part of a bigger puzzle. Forgive me if I sound presumptuous but you might have c-ptsd which describes somebody who has a complex relationship with PTSD because of repeated trauma. Abuse in a relationship and lots of uncertainty would make anybody feel unsafe. If you can find a councillor for c-ptsd it would change your life
WjOowWxOXCg,"@Susan Hopkinson We aren&#39;t Playing Victim&#39;, some people are just disadvantaged and recognise that."
WjOowWxOXCg,"@JL J You got such an important point there: &quot;Likeable people who don’t do their homework get jobs straight away. Because  people like them right off the bat. And they know they don’t have to do their homework.&quot; that right there is one of the biggest problems for both, those who do their job and those who do not (who with their more psychopathic or manipulative tendencies can cause great harm to society) Some of them do their homework and are still more liked than others and I guess they become happily successful people.. those are the ones that can be called fortunate"
WjOowWxOXCg,"Audrey Gibson, you certainly had it tough. And I think what you said is an example of what I tried expressing earlier, that being introspective and trying to get to the roots of the problem is not the same as sinking in self-pity and not being pro-active. You seem to be an example of being both, introspective and analytical and responsible/proactive. :)  I think that&#39;s what may fail to understand here. However, there are man reasons why some people might fail to be able to do the second, even as they try with all their heart. And a person can be able to achieve financial stability and try their best at being useful members of society (or at least, not hurtful members) and still not be able to put her/his pieces together in other ways. Different people undergo different journeys and we should not judge until we walk on their shoes. I do think it is society&#39;s responsibility to provide support for those members who fall off the edges."

It&#39;s difficult, sure, but everyone is always changing and growing and becoming new people every day.<br>To me, there&#39;s no point in studying psychology if you don&#39;t believe people can change and make better lives for themselves."
WjOowWxOXCg,noted. :)
WjOowWxOXCg,yes!
WjOowWxOXCg,@coffeedesk Your baby feels from your attitude and way of thinking how loved they are. Just the fact that you worry like this is a sign that you think about their wellbeing selflessly and as the top priority. You&#39;re taking care of him/her as well as you can.
WjOowWxOXCg,My husband doesn&#39;t make enough to put roof over our head so I&#39;m forced to work. I&#39;m eaten by this thought constantly as I just put my little one in daycare. Not all women who go to work do so because they value career more. Some of us don&#39;t have husbands who make enough money to live .
WjOowWxOXCg,"No, but feminism says that if the parents prefer it, mom can work and dad can stay with the kids, too. (Omg!) Or mom could stay home one year, then dad could stay home one year. Or both could work part-time. Or whatever they want (yes, also stay-at-home mom and working dad). The problem is what do the circumstances allow? In my country, both parents can get family leave until the child is 3. In other countries, such as the US,  both parents working full-time seems to be the only option financially for many parents."
WjOowWxOXCg,"you are misinformed, Pawel"
WjOowWxOXCg,"Hasiger Hase I said what I said 7 months ago and it still stands. People need Jesus. He will save you. I can meet 1,001 kind hearted people and still be drowning in my problems. People cannot save you. But hey, let’s just agree to disagree"
WjOowWxOXCg,"While philosophy, or a life belief, is handy, having secure people to hang with is also important. Getting the good parenting from others helps heal that broken thing inside."
WjOowWxOXCg,Danik2028 Agreed.

WjOowWxOXCg,"yes, it could be"
WjOowWxOXCg,Flavio Ferreira could you recommend sites and books?
WjOowWxOXCg,Flavio Ferreira could you please give me some advice for self therapy?
WjOowWxOXCg,You can heal your relationship with yourself
WjOowWxOXCg,No no.  You can overcome.  Awareness of why you experience these is a good start. Read more on it and seek counseling if that is available to you.
WjOowWxOXCg,"You shouldn&#39;t get too hung up on these boxes. Unlike Myers Briggs Personality Types (Which was born un scientific with some mother and daughter), Attachment theory is more precise, but in the end it&#39;s all a simplification of reality. You probably will fit in some attachment model more than others, but things happen in life and you may sometimes pick from others."
WjOowWxOXCg,I feel 65% anxious avoidant and 35% anxious disorganised
WjOowWxOXCg,Yes
WjOowWxOXCg,"If you feel that way, then you&#39;re probably the disorganized attachment style."
WjOowWxOXCg,@Racer X You just described me.
WjOowWxOXCg,"Same. I was a very trusty person and with time learned to trust less. I also had, and still have to some extent, a sense of inferiority which damaged my social life and self image. My parents always loved me and cared for me( in their own flawed way ), but their endless arguments made me a very shy kid. I had a relatively nice childhood until argument time came and I had to shut up and watch the &quot;adults do their business&quot; I don&#39;t want to ask you too personal questions so I&#39;ll ask this : Do you find a correlation between the cause of my childhood problems and yours and if you do relate, then can you share some tips on what have helped you to overcome them? Maybe I can also help you with a tip or two :)"
WjOowWxOXCg,Sprouts yeah true that!

Y9hWwxPV1bs,Welcome
Y9hWwxPV1bs,welcome
Y9hWwxPV1bs,There was one built about 15 years go here - after it fell off 3 time from hurricanes they finally did not rebuild it.
Y9hWwxPV1bs,My pleasure - glad it helped
Y9hWwxPV1bs,And that is why I put them out there.  Figured other students might needs them as well as my own.  Glad to know it will help!
Y9hWwxPV1bs,I am not sure that many professor even know how to make them to be honest - lol. They do take time.  I am glad it helped.
Y9hWwxPV1bs,I did not do Chapter 2 for my class - they are nurses and have a far better course in prenatal but  that is a good idea for me to do for this channel - sorry I do not have but thanks for the idea
Y9hWwxPV1bs,Glad it was helpful!
Y9hWwxPV1bs,"Your welcome! If you are in a psychology degree Dev Psy course - adult chapters might be a bit thin, but just ask and I will try to assist.  I am going to do another set for Psy students specifically as I skip stuff the nursing folks do not need to know in these lectures as we get to the adult stuff."
bounwXLkme4,I am from India an open learning institute  (NIOS) &#39;s student of 12 grade humanity stream . These videos help me alot in self learning. <br>KEEP IT UP @ sprouts 😍🤗 <br>Lots of love and blessings from India.
bounwXLkme4,The pharmacist doesn&#39;t approve..
bounwXLkme4,"But if you ask my personal opinion, if I was in that position, I would probably steal the medicine..."
bounwXLkme4,he got no time since his wife is near to death..
bounwXLkme4,-1
bounwXLkme4,..
bounwXLkme4,"I agree with this and would also like to point out that the doctors thought that this drug might save her , there is no certainty that the drug will save her life. All of his actions is based on a chance that might be 50/50"
bounwXLkme4,You&#39;re not really supposed to answer the questions for everyone. Kohlberg&#39;s intent was to see the responses and understand what levels existed. Sociologists and psychologists try to avoid saying level 4 is &quot;wrong&quot; as they aren&#39;t ready to understand level 5. Some do reach the next level; others don&#39;t.
bounwXLkme4,"particularly, in case he is black"
bounwXLkme4,"@Prof. Dr. ヴィクトリアミロシュニック I absolutely disagree. Joshua Lynn is only at stage 5. His answer is a shallow and obvious way of thinking, and is basically exactly how they describe stage 5 in the video; &quot;Well, the boy deserves the punishment because he did a bad thing.&quot; It&#39;s assuming the druggist deserves what he gets and has no redeeming motivating factor. Stage 6 thinking is more, &quot;I understand you want to make money to better your family&#39;s place in life, but you&#39;re doing it at the expense of others&#39; lives so it&#39;s no acceptable and you MUST charge less, or else.&quot;"
bounwXLkme4,@MKRJ the question was of individual morality rather than economics. That said your point is extremely valid and maybe raises a question of societal ethics
bounwXLkme4,"Perhaps the druggist spent his whole life sacrificing many precsious wants for the sake of inventing a curative pill.  Only the large reward at the end kept him hard at work all those years.   Remove that reward and maybe that curative pill may never have been invented.   Are we judging the the druggist too quickly?   While it should be enough for the druggist to know he/she is saving others this ignores basic human behavior/drives - and perhaps that&#39;s the point... ethics helps us rise above basic human behaviors and drives.    Hmmm.   All that said, I&#39;d have a very hard time punishing the husband."
bounwXLkme4,"Congrats, Joshua Lynn! Your opinion is a clear example of the highest sixth level of the post-conventional stage of moral development according to Kohlberg&#39;s theory."
bounwXLkme4,"@Abe McGee true, its reality but thats what law says..ethics say that they should get punishment ..but unfortunatly we live in a society based on &quot;blind-law&quot; and not morals...but again different people have different morals so blind law is kinda best solution..that means yes they are under no obligation to save someones life..sad but true"
bounwXLkme4,"David, I think you hit the nail on the head here. A lot of people won&#39;t like it, but I fully believe this is stage 6 thinking. I formulated my answers similarly before I read yours."
bounwXLkme4,David Roddick: The questions weren&#39;t designed to establish &quot;right or wrong&quot;. People at a level 4 aren&#39;t going to agree with level 5 positions... they don&#39;t perceive them. They are into self-interest.
bounwXLkme4,"Good point, you see the world is pretty self-centred nowadays..."
bounwXLkme4,That&#39;s not what&#39;s happening. You&#39;re just not understanding the argument. You&#39;ve not reached Stage 6 of the moral development. You&#39;re stuck at either 4 or 5. Try to really read and understand what people are saying and why they are saying it.
bounwXLkme4,"How much did the pharmacist pay for it? Is the pharmacist working for a big box chain? Or, does he own the small township pharmacy? So many questions about the situation that need answers. Could the husband have gotten for free from the drug manufacturer, or a nominal amount? Yes, they actually have such programs. I couldn’t believe it either!!!"
bounwXLkme4,"@Tidbit hehe i live in Denmark. :) Healtcare is free so i dont recognize the problem. But in SoMe countrys i Can see its different. Here we just get it for free, it would never had Been a problem in the first Place."
bounwXLkme4,"I would argue the whole point of the law is to make a more moral society.  Stealing is wrong so the first three options are off the table.  The pharmacist isn&#39;t &quot;just doing their job&quot; because they are charging 10 times the cost which is 1000% markup, that is morally disgusting, to let people die just because you want more profit, it&#39;s also inefficient and lazy, and takes advantage of having a monopoly or near monopoly of that particular drug(this is what &#39;big pharma&#39; does in the real world, in a fair capitalist system, with a level playing field there would be other pharmacists that would sell the drug for less money in order to compete).  So it is the pharmacist that is acting in an illegal, and immoral, way."
bounwXLkme4,"@David Therwhanger Government has a lengthy history of negotiating outcomes over dictating them when their resolution is a national concern (strikes are an example), though there is certainly some guaranteed dictation, especially when regulations have been broken (at least there should be; assuming enforcement).<br><br>Also, what you mentioned about the FDA sounds like protectionism. Which is surprising since I feel most would say the U.S has committed itself to the principles of free trade and economic liberalization since the federal income tax (to which middle class Americans actually contribute more) and WW2."
bounwXLkme4,"I agree something must be done. But doing the same thing that has had disastrous results when done in the past is probably not the way to go. Government setting prices has failed time and time again in many other areas. I know you said negotiate, but the government rarely negotiates when it has the power to simply dictate. Alternatively allowing the industry to help draft regulation doesn&#39;t work well either. That is how the US went from over 2 dozen car makers in the early 20th century to just 3 in the mid 20th century. Those 3 helped draft the regulation.<br><br>I don&#39;t know if this has been tried before, but what if instead of giving a pharmaceutical company inside our borders exclusivity, we expand it to those outside our country can get approval as well. Broadening the market. As I understand it right now foreign pharmaceutical companies can import drugs into the US on a case by case basis if they have no part of their company here. Meaning that a citizen can order a medication from outside the US only so long as the drug in question is not made here. But as soon as a company here in the US begins making that drug, citizens are not allowed to get that drug from the foreign companies that have had mass production, and thus a lower price; and must instead begin buying the drug from the US company at whatever price the US company sets. I remember hearing about a case about 5 to 8 years ago about this. And I think the FDA still has it this way.<br><br>How it works as I understand it is if you have a condition and require a drug that is not available in the US and doesn&#39;t have FDA approval you can get special dispensation thru the FDA to purchase the drug abroad. Until a US company gets approved by the FDA to manufacture that medicine and the FDA cancels your special dispensation.<br><br><a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/matthewherper/2011/03/23/the-most-innovative-countries-in-biology-and-medicine/?sh=71f5805b1a71"">https://www.forbes.com/sites/matthewherper/2011/03/23/the-most-innovative-countries-in-biology-and-medicine/?sh=71f5805b1a71</a><br>I know the data is a little old, but I think it hasn&#39;t changed that much in the last decade. Without large profits, interest in researching and developing new drugs would dry up. And as the graph shows 40% of all the new research in the world is done by the US. For that to take a significant hit I fear in our drive to reap the benefits we accidently kill the goose laying the golden eggs. I know the extortion rates of some medications are going to hurt some people. I just don&#39;t want our desire to save a few end up killing the many of the future."
bounwXLkme4,Well summarised
bounwXLkme4,"Look at Jesus, he is the standard. We are way too fallible as you said"
bounwXLkme4,do unto others as you would have them do onto you.  Funny how something so simple can work <br>for 2000 years
bounwXLkme4,"Things necessary for human life should never be for profit. At 10x the production cost, greed killed the woman and not the disease."
bounwXLkme4,"@Kate Lim the goal is to  never become sick? I&#39;m pretty sure no one&#39;s goal is to become sick and need some expensive treatment. Then you put, if it&#39;s an accident or something?? You could have simply said that you wouldn&#39;t steal the drug. Or do you believe people go around giving themselves breast cancer, or a brain tumor? I guess that says something about character in itself"
bounwXLkme4,"The goal is to never become sick that you need to rely on expensive medical treatment. If it&#39;s an accident or something, I talk to my husband about it, and neither of us would steal the drug. I&#39;ll spend his last days with him by his side. We&#39;ll see each other in the afterlife. :)"
bounwXLkme4,"totally agree, except the last part. if the customer can get the drug somewhere else, then the price of this drug will drop 50% due to the competition between those pharmacies.<br>if the two pharmacists who have the drug reached a deal to keep the drug price high to make more benefit, then the margin of this drug price will drive more competitors join the game and lower the price."
bounwXLkme4,"@Steve Lawrence like the movie John Q... These dilemmas are not about the actual answer, but the reasoning that one goes through."
bounwXLkme4,"@Kurt Johansson A democraty worth its name is so much more than just a majority rule. Free and independent press, a solid constitution, courts independent of the political rule, free and unbiased education, freedom of speech etc. All this makes it very unlikely for situations like the One you describe to occur. The system is designed to prevent that. Not perfect by any means but imo the risc of individuals claiming moral superiority for totally egoistic reasons is orders of magnitude higher"
bounwXLkme4,"Suppose the man instead spends a year researching the disease, and finds the cure himself. He produces it and gives it to his wife.The next day however, the police knocks at his door and tell him he is being charged for patent infringement. Would that be right or wrong?"
bounwXLkme4,"&quot;A man&#39;s ethical behavior should be based effectually on sympathy, education, and social ties and needs; no religious basis is necessary.<br><br> Man would indeed be in a poor way if he had to be restrained by fear of punishment and hope of reward after death.&quot;<br>- Albert Einstein"
bounwXLkme4,Totally agree. We have created a society mostly full of juvenile delinquents.
bounwXLkme4,"@TheGratefulSteve Haha, no, though I respect those that are.  Not profiting from the death or possible misuse of another creature is very admirable!  Due to humans&#39; biological natures, we need a large amount of protein in our diets, and the most readily available source of protein in the wild comes from animals.  We were basically made to eat (at least some) meat, so eating meat can&#39;t, in itself, be an immoral act for a human.  Though immorality and virtue are divided by a gap wherein acts are neither virtuous nor immoral.  I think eating meat (and eggs and cheese) falls into that gap.  I try to buy pasture-raised eggs, happy cow meat, etc. when it&#39;s available, but I don&#39;t require it of myself either.  In middle America, food choices are somewhat limited."
bounwXLkme4,Are you vegan?
bounwXLkme4,"You forget an important thing! The ought of Hippocrates, he is bound to it, in this case the pharmacist. So yes he has to endure the consequences. Your text is instructif and mostly subjectif. internal motivations does play here; I wrote - I think before turning a burglar I should follow the moral path , if and only if time does mattes, than still I would do the moral path (shortcut)  and go right afterward the burglar path. Leaving money, and turn myself in. Greetings."
bounwXLkme4,"you are only at stage 3 of moral development, according to Kohlberg theory; good luck with you journey up"
bounwXLkme4,"Do you support the banning of factory farming? We all know the atrocity that it is. So if I break into a farm to save animals, will you be on the side who wants to punish me? Or will you live by your own statement and say a life is more important than profits?<br><br>Remember, you said a life is a life, no matter who it belongs to. Be vegan my friend. ❤️"
bounwXLkme4,Oh wow finally someone figured it out. I guess we can delete this video now.
bounwXLkme4,"How and why you interpret what you think is a reliable answer, &quot;When you ask your self&quot;, depends on what you understand holistically. Doing your research helps more than sitting in expectation.., sometimes."
bounwXLkme4,Otherwise known as situational ethics.
bounwXLkme4,"@TheGratefulSteve Yes, I agree completely. We have and are trying to make the positive changes within our own little world. It has to start at home and within a small community of people."
bounwXLkme4,Adamantly opposed to the current system we find ourselves in today.

bounwXLkme4,"How about this moral dilemma... since it has been found to be unnecessary to consume animal products for human health. And that animal products come from unnecessary exploitation, abuse and the murder of animals. While also producing enormous amounts of pollution and requiring an even more exorbitant amount of resources to produce. What justification does one have to continue participating in funding such a vile industry?"
bounwXLkme4,"I agree, which is also why I believe for-profit health systems are inherently wrong."
bounwXLkme4,@Kittyququmber I’m aware. Just because something is so does not mean it’s justified.
bounwXLkme4,@Wildfire wake up. America is built on this model (I do not live on the North American continent). Easy to pass judgement on limited information that the story gives. This is the problem with the judgement of bioethics. One has to understand all the facts of individual cases. This is the reason there are bioethics committees in hospitals and universities -which I have sat on  for many years. This story is made to sway one opinion. One has to know the whole circumstance. Much is underneath the story.
bounwXLkme4,"@Kittyququmber The pharmacist’s wife is not sick at home and dying, in fact she isn’t even a factor to consider in this dilemma. This fabricated point only communicates your sympathy with the person directly responsible for this problem, as well as highlighting how you NEED to introduce other elements in order to portray this situation differently.<br><br>There is no moral defense for charging inordinately higher than the cost of production, neither for amenities nor life’s essential. And especially not for a life-saving drug."
bounwXLkme4,"@Thomas Wood Right, baby vs bathwater."
bounwXLkme4,"I couldn&#39;t put my finger on it, but something did feel off about their examples while watching. I do assume it&#39;s a faulty interpretation/assumption, and that the actual theory is more fleshed out, altho I also haven&#39;t read it."
bounwXLkme4,@Chris Gillard None of what you’ve implied is unjust is actually unjust. Public health is well within the purview of government as it’s… public.
bounwXLkme4,@Wildfire Far too many people allow themselves to be obedient to unjust laws and mandates. They should learn real quick on how to stand up for themselves.
bounwXLkme4,@Chris Gillard Against their will? A country can force itself to do something against its own will?

bounwXLkme4,The point of the questions is NOT &quot;the right answer&quot; but how you got to any answer. The thought process is what is being measured here.
bounwXLkme4,stealing is more immoral than cheating at a multiplayer game though.
bounwXLkme4,I noticed i used to live with people that steal from me I told them its acceptable to steal a percent but not everything. my boss said don&#39;t steal at all.
bounwXLkme4,if when you steal you deprive someone of a lifesource completely that is wrong though.
bounwXLkme4,As long as the patrons of the restaurant aren&#39;t deprived of everything I&#39;m all for stealing.
bounwXLkme4,I&#39;m also not morally against stealing food if homeless.
bounwXLkme4,hopefully coming soon! 🙏
bounwXLkme4,"@Manas er, thanks for the insightful contribution..."
bounwXLkme4,I mean I knew I&#39;d find a &quot;master moralist&quot; but not this fast
bounwXLkme4,Yes. That&#39;s why my answer to the dilemma question is do nothing and spend the final days with your loved one. :)
bounwXLkme4,@BUTTER It has lifted the world out of poverty and there is no workable alternative to it.
bounwXLkme4,"Im conseravtive in everything, but honestly I think free healthcare or atleast good insurance should be a thing."
bounwXLkme4,"In an extreme capitalist system, the only thing which matters is selfisness and one&#39;s own well-being is the only existing value. Therefore, those who cannot help themselves are doomed to die on the streets. Some people also call it as a social-darwinist system."

bounwXLkme4,"Great response!<br>Wow Homer, you’ve come a long way from your blundering days working at the power plant"
bounwXLkme4,"yeah i think there should be a new placed for people who are going to die unless they get something, people should be able to get that thing they need to live and be able to pay it off later or get help from a bank or something, capitalism is bull"

bounwXLkme4,this is a clear example of the stage 1 of moral development according to Kohlberg&#39;s theory
bounwXLkme4,"great answer;   however, your answer is a clear example of stage 5 of moral development, according to Kohlberg theory"
bounwXLkme4,The Heinz Dilemma is an extreme example of today&#39;s insulin profiteering in the USA. Getting the drug from Canada is indeed an option a modern-day Heinz should consider. Follow-up questions: At what moral development stage is a pharmaceutical company that jacks up the price for the drug if it were judged by Kohlberg&#39;s standards? Can a nation whose most powerful interests are the embodiment of pre-conventional morality effectively serve the interests of the disenfranchised?
bounwXLkme4,Lol

bounwXLkme4,@Barry Balzak you need to study for 3 months to just haal a 10 on 20
bounwXLkme4,"even if I would fail, I would learn as much as I can in those 2 hours, search, talk, ask, there are so many things you can do in 2 hours. Then, meaby I would have a chance to pass. If I sit there for 2 hours  sure I would fail. It is up to you if you will fail or try to pass!"
bounwXLkme4,Sorry you have to learn a prescriptive lazy take on moral development for the sake of passing a test mandated by authority. Maybe afterwards you can learn something about morality that&#39;s real and useful.
bounwXLkme4,You remind me of myself 🥲✊✊<br>I literally watch all sorts of videos just to not study
bounwXLkme4,Yes
bounwXLkme4,@FT Right. Which is exactly what I&#39;m arguing.
bounwXLkme4,this is so dumb the whole point of the dilemma is sometimes ethic principals and moral are more important than obeying the rules

Just trying to be realistic as possible, depends how the court would handle something like this, maybe they&#39;d let him off easy because of the situation!"
bounwXLkme4,This explanation is one of the most perfect examples of sociopathic thinking I&#39;ve ever seen. Ever.
bounwXLkme4,"From what I can gather, it ends up creating a culture of avoidance at any cost, opening up a window to develop (or ‘strategize’ less than ideal means of doing which become justified by the ends (avoidance of violence). One byproduct could be not having the gall to interfere where a violent situation does not concern you, incapable of committing yourself to the defense of others when you cannot commit yourself to your own defense. On top of that it can also spill over into other things (avoiding heartbreak by giving up on that pursuit, for instance).<br><br>“Avoid violence.” If you fail, what do you do?<br>“Avoid violence.” You fail, what do you do?<br>If the only answer is some variation of “I don’t know”, “…”, or “withdraw entirely”, there may be an issue."
bounwXLkme4,@Adolph Paffen usually I would agree but there are some really weird people out there and this will work on 98% of the people.
bounwXLkme4,"@Tim In my experience if you challenge a bully with violence even if you are not a good fighter the bully will look for another victim and leave you alone. If you fight a bully and lose the fight, as long as you put up a good show you will not have to worry about the bully as bullies are interested in easy targets i.e. people who don&#39;t fight back. Running to a teacher for help will never do the trick."
bounwXLkme4,"It depends on the people you meet.<br>You should always try to avoid violence but in some situations or for some people it takes some violence.<br>As soon as they noticed you are capable of fighting back they usually stop, except when they are stronger than you but thats an even more complicated topic.<br><br>Just try to avoid violence but be ready to use it.<br>&quot;War is not a solution but an option.&quot;"
bounwXLkme4,"Both my father and mother told me to fight back if I was bullied, because if you don&#39;t fight back you will always be bullied. I learned even if you don&#39;t win the fight, the bullies will not bother you anymore, but move on to another victim that will not fight back."
bounwXLkme4,exactly
bounwXLkme4,i mean it has multitudes. finn as a 7 yr old might be scared of punishment by teachers and another 7 yr old might be scared to get beaten up by the bullies. maybe that&#39;s like a slow transition into stage 2 of pre conventional morality. the girl was interested in how this wld affect her and that cld be the only reason she did or did not stand up for tom u know

bounwXLkme4,These comments only show that very few have moved from stage 5 into stage 6.
bounwXLkme4,"I don&#39;t agree....there&#39;s right and wrong and hienz needs to put the effort into finding a way to get the money legitimately.....it doesn&#39;t matter who&#39;s family it is, the price has already been set by the manufacturer, no matter how high or outrageous for hienz it is. So it is now the pharmacists fault because hienze doesn&#39;t make enough money???.....so the pharmacist would have to change his price for any person who says they can&#39;t afford it ...I wonder how many years and dollars went into even making a drug that could save hienzswife to begin with....there&#39;s a real problem with the whole &quot;apologize after&quot; thought process.....hienz needs to step his game up save his wife and be able to look at himself in the mirror later.....sounds like he gave up and took the easy way out....."

bounwXLkme4,Watching this on my own for an assignment
bounwXLkme4,congrats! the clear example of the stage 6 of moral development: the universal ethical principles!
bounwXLkme4,"A life is worth exactly a life. If you saving a life endangers a life, then you do no good. If you do save a family member by sacrifising the well-being of another, then you are just deciding who lives and who dies; you play god.<br><br>While I agree that no money in the world is worth the same as a human life, that only is true as long as the money wasn`t necessary for other people to live. Image that because you stole something, another person lost his job and died? You stole 200$ worth of drugs, which is why the cashier is paid 200$ less. But the cashier needed to use the 200$ to pay for the drugs of his daughter. Was stealing still right? How are you dealing with the cashier&#39;s daughter dying?"
bounwXLkme4,@will leslie this is just for the  emergency situation<br>It&#39;s about saving life<br>Well it&#39;s true that earning livelihood   for the pharmacist is equality important.<br>But what you&#39;ll choose to do at first when at one side someone is dying and to other someone needs food.
bounwXLkme4,Priceless? How about the $250k needed to raise a kid to 18? How about the pharmacist needing to make a living for himself and spending his money and time into making the pharmacy or product? Stop being entitled.
bounwXLkme4,@Rose Clearwater yeah I would really harm or do anything to the pharmacist since again they are just there to sell it and follow the rules and if they just give shit away for half the price it could get them fired and they have a family and people close to help too<br><br>Honestly ill only do something super petty when their a massive asshole about refusing or smt tho I will still try to take the drugs even by illegal means if it means that person close to me lives
bounwXLkme4,"I actually wouldn&#39;t be too hard on the pharmacist, for he is just another employee low on the hierarchy of the system. He did not make the drug price it is only his duty to sell it. The problem with capitalism is the people at the bottom keep fighting with each other instead of realizing they are just another cog in a machine and do not get paid what their worth from their crap jobs. The poor man falls through the cracks of a bad healthcare system. The people at the top benefit from the fighting and make ALOT of money with sleazy, greedy means, and they should be the ones you should take from.<br><br>I&#39;d recommend watching Contrapoints&#39; 2 videos on the &quot;Problems of Capitalism&quot;, very funny, good, and informative (((:"

bounwXLkme4,"Good question! And more importantly, if the medicine was in short supply and she discovers that someone else died--perhaps someone younger, with more life ahead of her--because her husband stole the medicine and gave it to her instead, would she really want to live the rest of her life with that guilt?"
bounwXLkme4,@drconkle1 we should know as in the past 50 years we’ve paid anywhere from 45-75% of it as taxpayers if we are talking US.
bounwXLkme4,You realize medication research is expensive and if they were to give it away for free future research would greatly decline with no monetary motivation.
bounwXLkme4,"What if no one gives money in the fundraiser? Every human being deserves to live? Would you give up one of your kidneys to save a life of someone? Why should pharma firms give medicine for free? They are in the business of making profit, not of saving lives, which is the entire reason why life saving medicines even exist on the first place."
bounwXLkme4,"which would have resulted in his wife&#39;s death, so how is that doing no wrong to allow your loved one to die? Inaction resulting in your wifes death is not doing no wrong. A society in which profits from your wife&#39;s sickness is unethical, so why would you follow the ethical guidelines of a society that is currently wronging you?"

bounwXLkme4,Increase productivity IMO. Theft usually cause very bad incentives for wealth creation.
bounwXLkme4,"which would involve accountability on part of the pharmaceutical industry who literally controls the politicians who are made incredibly wealthy pushing for pharmaceutical laws. Think about it, people in congress....are millionaires. If that isn&#39;t corruption I don&#39;t know what is. The person who draft the minimum wage laws get cash outs from multi-billion dollar business to approve laws that are to the benefit of their companies."
bounwXLkme4,"the question was, SHOULD the pharmacist (or more correct pharmaceutical company) be held responsible for putting profit over the lives of others who are in desperate need of life saving medicine (for example, the exact thing happened with Pharma Bro Martin Skreli who had a patent on the only available drug that saved the life of patients with HIV, raising the price from something like 5$ a pill to like 1000$ a bill or something ridiculous like that. The answer, is clearly an ethical choice. We live in such a society, but the question is weather or not that society is ethical or not. Which, i&#39;d think it would be hard to argue that it is ethical to put profit over life as an ethical conclusion. <br>The second is an assumption that the husband WOULD be arrested, not only is that not a guarantee, but it also posits the idea that breaking the law is justified if the ends are justified. For example, stealing bread to feed your starving sisters life. But also the idea that just because you stole something, and got caught doesnt mean much of anything if you consider your temporary punishment worthy of risking, for a person to continue to live. For example, courts will take into consideration the motivations in a case, especially if its a crime motivated by compassion. If a judge had to sentence someone for theft for stealing drugs that would keep his wife alive it would greatly have influenced the court decision, plus, assuming he didn&#39;t get caught in the process might have saved her life in time. Getting caught is not part of the hypothetical the hypothetical is the risk. Which is precisely what they went over with the post-conventional morality. Which is what justice systems and law makers are trying to align. Police officers are conventional morality, enforcing the rules, judges and law makers are creating them. <br>would it change anything if he didn&#39;t love his wife? ethically, no. Irregardless of how someone feels towards another we as a society have an obligation to do what we can to maintain health and wellbeing and are not in any position to judge weather or not someone should or shouldn&#39;t be provided life saving drugs.<br>Repeat this for third option of it being a stranger. Ethics should not be conditional on emotional attachment. especially with regard to social issues like access to health care.<br>should the pharmacist be arrested for murder? he should be held accountable. Not for the murder, because he didn&#39;t give her the illness but he contributed to her death by refusing life saving mechanisms. For example, if someone had a life threatening injury on the side of the high way and someone who had the paramedics knowledge to assist, but chose not to, is not the cause of the persons death, but ethically guilt of refusing to assist contributing to their demise.<br><br>In conclusion, they all merit special consideration. but since the only option that runs the risk of successfully saving the life of the indivdal means stealing the medicine that would be the choice, if someone didn&#39;t love their wife enough to do that, it would be risking one&#39;s self and they might choose not to bceause they are fearful of the consequences and the outcome isnt beneficial to them. (but irregardless how psychopathic could someone be allow their wife to die is pretty messed up even if you have a falling out) would you specifically steal for a stranger? why not. if you&#39;d steal for a loved one, the idea that the stranger is any less worthy of life over our wife is a bit self centered. and yes the pharmacist should be held responsible for withholding life saving medicine, but since the contributing reasons why he didnt are so multifarious he would like not see charges in the real world because of how poorly structured and corrupt the system of profiting from the long term medical needs of a society in a corporate field of medicine."
bounwXLkme4,HAHAHAHAHAHAHA😭😭
bounwXLkme4,one of the best comments on the internet lol

bounwXLkme4,Lol😂
bounwXLkme4,"Hi bigshooter461, thanks so much for the insightful comment and adding to the debate! :)"
bounwXLkme4,"Why should we not arrest you for not helping, The pharmacist was at least providing an opportunity?"
bounwXLkme4,"I personaly think it quite weak. Laws are built upon the ethics of a society; thus, by putting the lawful person on another level than the ethical principles, he principally misunderstood society. We don`t just write laws without thinking about it, we think about what is right and create or change law to reflect our beliefs. Thus, the lawful person would be the person who acts upon the ethics of the society he lives in, while stage five and six live by their person ethics."
bounwXLkme4,"i mean,. right?"
bounwXLkme4,@Erik The Existor bruh you&#39;re harsher than me
bounwXLkme4,Thank you so much Madhu .S😀
bounwXLkme4,"but the question is, would it be okay for him to do it if it was a stranger, or he didnt love his wife. and would the pharmacist be held responsible if she died."

bounwXLkme4,"And more precisely, what SHOULD your character&#39;s alignment be?"
bounwXLkme4,"Nice! I like the thinking! Thank you, Suzanne!"
bounwXLkme4,"alright, i&#39;m realizing my answers to 2&amp;3 need to be modified... above, I answered from the basis of his preliminary decision (to steal the medicine). the thing I didn&#39;t consider was, what informed his initial decision. variables like love and interpersonal relationships intrinsically motivate selfish behavior (on an egocentric or societal level). the thing is though, everything is selfish. everything. morality (as we consider it) is simplified down to a measure of ethical gusto. we accept &quot;morality&quot; as a maxim -- we create words like &quot;selfless&quot; that slander the reputation of &quot;selfish,&quot; thereby motivating societal organizations that create and maintain order. the point is, there is no strict right or wrong any given scenario -- rather, the cumulative legitimacy of factors that inform decisions AND the decision&#39;s subsequent repercussions, decide what is right or wrong at a certain instance in time."
bounwXLkme4,"I would also suggest that the idea of levels, making the top the best, is misleading as each level is organically right in the context of a developmental system (not just a conceptual argument from one of the levels speaking of the system,) through which people must experience and see things through their own eyes rather than a logical challenge of what is the system that is best and to be arrived at through filtering assumptions until the right set are developed. I don&#39;t think you can think yourself to the highest level - it has to be experienced and process in ways of our lives."
bounwXLkme4,"precisely highlighting the failure of our government to provide an ethical foundation for medical assistance.  this is a great breaking bad comparison. someone who had to break the law, to provide the health care that they needed to live."
bounwXLkme4,"The last level this channel gets wrong. The &quot;universal principle&quot; wasnt compassion, it was a moral framework of the persons choosing. So you can replace thatw ith any moral system in which you have attempted to ground out and centered around any value you wish. Take for instance myself. Im an act utilitarian, I believe the highest order is maximizing utility for society, myself, and those around me. However I believe the best method for doing so is looking at the available options in front of you and picking among them based on what nets the highest utility. The utility however is not a set thing, it can be money, it can be social capital, it can be happiness, health etc. The one I choose to value is the utility of joy via the mitigation of suffering. So I weigh whose suffering matters most to me. First and foremost it is myself and my partner. Then my family. Then my community. Then my class. Then the species. And so on. So in this instance I dont care much that me stealing might create a few points of suffering to the druggist, as the suffering incurred to myself, my family, my partner even if objectively equal (which they arent seeing as one is a loss of money or product the other is life) it would still outweigh as through my subjection i find theres to be worse. In this case I would steal the persons drug. And I would consider anyone, even someone doing so against me to be morally correct in doing so. If a poor woman needed to feed her child, and was faced with no other way than putting a gun to my head and stealing what i had to do so, it would suck and I would dislike them but they are morally right. Hope that helps."
bounwXLkme4,"I feel the need to challenge your assumption because it infers that a person&#39;s morality can in fairness be judged by the publicly perceived &quot;goodness&quot;, or the reverse, of their family of origin. While your statement, in and of itself, may seem logical and, thus, true, it is a generalization that can be damaging to individuals, particularly in cultures that have maintained a system of social and/or economic class stratification that encourages prejudice against individuals based on a factors they have no control over, including their family of origin.<br><br><br>Nobility CAN and often does spring from the soul, thus no one should be measured against anyone else, nor presumed to be anything other than who they are as an individual. An individual&#39;s family&#39;s reputation, good or bad, in and of itself, should not determine how an individual member is perceived. Conversely, nor should a family be harshly judged due to public perceptions of one of their offspring gone awry, particularly where that has not been a family&#39;s perceived &quot;norm&quot;.  <br><br><br>I have known people from extremely challenged backgrounds who followed their inner voice (aka the beat of their own drum) and developed into loving, caring, intelligent human beings in spite of their upbringing, in some cases so unlike their family of origin in nature that they could not maintain connections with its members.  Further, if your generalization was, in fact, true, how could one explain the cause when a so-called &quot;excellent family&quot;, with a &quot;highly respected&quot; lineage, produces offspring that seem entirely devoid of conscience or care for the thoughts, feelings or needs of others?  I have seen this in my life-time as well. <br><br><br>Ultimately, it is the individual who determines his/her own morality, thus they should not be measured against anyone else&#39;s, nor should anyone else be measured against their&#39;s."
bounwXLkme4,"Tons of animals exhibit compassion, tons of humans even today exhibit compassion. What has changed is not whether or not we have compassion, but how far it takes us, and who we find deserving of it."
bounwXLkme4,And what WOULD Jesus do?
bounwXLkme4,Thank you!
bounwXLkme4,"another argument in the second iteration is that you could consider the death of a significant relation to be mentally scarring, even physically harmful (many widow&#39;s die within 10 years of their significant other&#39;s death as an example) so it could be argued that Heinz&#39;s action of theft is actually an act of self preservation. The same spirit of the law exists with looting laws for people in a life or death situation (eg. lost in the wild for weeks without food and stealing food from a farmers house to survive is not illegal) That argument fails to hold up if he does not have a strong bond with the person he attempts to save ie. only an acquaintance"

bounwXLkme4,@M Z In the past there was many who hated Christians for going against the old testament and those from the Islam world who beleive Christians are the to be eradicated from the Earth according to thier prophet Mohamed. Most of the deaths caused by Christians was from wars. It&#39;s a normal way of life if you consider what happened in history and human nature.

bounwXLkme4,"They displayed unselfish interference at Stage 4 (the teacher didn&#39;t interfere for selfish reasons: he interfered for societal ones). But, you are missing the point. Any action could be taken at any of these stages and still be valid, depending on the rationalization. For example, the boy at Stage 1 could have interfered in the fight out of fear that his friend would be angry with him if he didn&#39;t help. The headmaster at Stage 6 could have interfered to try and help the boys come to a peaceful resolution: he just wasn&#39;t present during the fight in this example. That would certainly have been selfless interference if he had been. The cartoon can&#39;t cover all the potential possibilities - it is a simple illustrative narrative giving examples."
bounwXLkme4,"Kohlberg&#39;s work was based on Piaget&#39;s, however you feel about it. They certainly did do their research."
bounwXLkme4,Better question:<br>Would you still have that same set of morals and convictions without ever knowing the concept of an afterlife?
bounwXLkme4,But if you steal the person getz the drug once and gets better but without continuous treatment can be detrimental to her recovery. Thus not only killing her in the long run but also preventing her loved one or her from seeing each other making it lonely scared and messed up for both parties.
bounwXLkme4,"will leslie ?!?! Why does the pharmacist “deserve it all”? This is presuming, as do so many, that the man who needs but can’t afford the medication to save his wife  doesn’t also work very hard..... typically those with less liquid capital are working the hardest...."
bounwXLkme4,The pharmacist has every right to sell it for whatever price they want. They put their heart and soul and years into making the product or pharmacy. Stop being brainwashed by society thinking you deserve it all.
bounwXLkme4,ch4nz viewing life as of relative importance would be a sort of self interested action.
bounwXLkme4,"the example made it crystal clear. He couldn&#39;t get enough money even with external help, the options were leaving his wife to die or stealing"
bounwXLkme4,Why?
bounwXLkme4,@Viduthalai T Thank u...nice to see u😊😊
bounwXLkme4,@AJEETH KUMAR oh nice
bounwXLkme4,@Viduthalai T ohh very good.. nw i am working in madurai..

bounwXLkme4,@viduthalai selvi <br>Where u r frm tamilnadu..? R u a psychology student??😊😊
bounwXLkme4,"Same. Right now, but it makes a lot of sense."
bounwXLkme4,But did you steal your drugs?
bounwXLkme4,"He hurt the owner of the pharmacy, who now has to pay for the damage from the things that were broken."
bounwXLkme4,"The government should not have reduced the price of the product. Like you said the pharmacist has every right to sell it for what they like. Also, government spending is created either with tax or printing money (causing inflation, which destroys societies). <br><br>The husband should be charged with petty theft (which basically ends up being a loan) to the pharmacy. And that should be that"
bounwXLkme4,"@Sprouts there is an interesting video by VSauce in his series Minefield about the Stanford Prison Experiment where they have a &quot;hero&quot; program and then they test the participants and strangers and see how they act in a real situation and to their surprise (or maybe not) the people of the program did not perform better than other people. I don&#39;t think that their experiment is particularly good because it takes inaction as, perhaps, an immoral decision with which I do not agree because it ignores context and is not objective. I really enjoy your videos. Hope COPPA won&#39;t hurt you too much!"
bounwXLkme4,"Hi SiMe, thank you for your thorough comment. I very much appreciate it. You brought up some excellent questions: <br>You made me think about the question: Can we make moral judgments of any situation, if we are not directly involved in the situation? Or, if it doesn&#39;t concern ourselves directly?<br>In his study, Kohlberg used hypothetical moral dilemmas, but when we are confronted with moral dilemmas, in reality, our thinking/decision making will quite likely be very different. This point was often criticized in his study. <br>And I believe, this issue affects us on a daily base, f.e. when we read the news and we make moral judgments about situations somewhere else. It is quite easy to know what&#39;s the right thing to do, when you don&#39;t carry the costs of the decision. <br>It&#39;s a big topic to discuss and there is lot&#39;s more to say. Thanks for the inspiration!"
bounwXLkme4,Wrong. It is not exploiting anyone to have private property rights.
bounwXLkme4,"@John Matthias No, capitalism is about <b>who</b> owns the <i>means of productions.</i>  News flash, <b>you are</b> the means of production.  <b>I am</b> the means of production. In socialist countries, doctors get forced to provide services at fixed rates because because they don&#39;t own themselves.  Capitalism is the <i>only moral</i> option, as everything else requires somebody to give up their time for free, which is the definition of slavery. Besides, you&#39;d be hard pressed to find a capitalist society these days.  The US hasn&#39;t been anywhere close to capitalist for about a hundred years now so it&#39;s nice that people like to conflate capitalism with the current fascism in socialism&#39;s clothing with capitalism, but this isn&#39;t how capitalisms work.<br><br><br>Besides, hein&#39;s issue is <b>exactly</b> what health insurance, charities, credit, and savings were put in place to fix.<br><br><br>So No, The pharmacist is in no way obligated to do anything for heinz or his wife, regardless of the outcome.<br><br><br>Since you disagree with me, can you tell me <b>exactly</b> why the pharmacist <b>should</b> be responsible for heinz&#39;s wife&#39;s death?  What did he <b>do</b> that means he should suffer punishment?"
bounwXLkme4,"@John Matthias Yes, but part of society&#39;s stability <b>IS</b> private property. If you take away that profit incentive for the product that the pharmacist is producing, you take away the pharmacist&#39;s motivation to make more of the drug. Production plummets and more people die.  This cycle is plain as day in <b>every</b> socialism there was on the planet.  Resources start to get spent poorly by the state, people who provide <i>basic necesseties</i> like farmers etc are forced to work at fixed rates because the state owns them, and those people stop working the farms and go do a more <i>profitable</i> profession, and then food production plummets and people start starving to death.<br><br><br>It&#39;s easy to say <i>not providing private property to save a strangers life</i> is wrong, but it&#39;s even <b>worse</b> when people <b>demand</b> that the life saving things be provided for free or at a fixed price, because then it&#39;s supply plummets, and since the price is fixed, nobody but black market dealers start providing the product, but this time it has that sweet sweet banned substance markup.<br><br><br>Private property is more important to a society, and anytime you make exceptions to those rules, things go downhill fast for those industries.<br><br><br><b>edit:</b> If you <b>really</b> want a good solution, lower the patent and copyrights down to 3 years like they were when the US was founded.  Once drugs go out of patent, they get cloned and the price plummets.  Your pharmacist might cause people to die, but once his formula is out in the wild, the prices plummet even more.  If you want to blame someone for heinz predicament, blame the government for protecting the pharmacist&#39;s formula for 7 years (+ when you can abuse the law by changing the formula ever so slightly to get another 7 years from it).<br>Government, once again, is the cause of heinz problems."
bounwXLkme4,"​@Jarrod Society comes with obligations as well as rights.  The drug owner has a right to remuneration, but not the right to withhold the drug at the cost of other people&#39;s lives."
bounwXLkme4,@John Matthias How so?  Why is the man <i>entitled</i> to another man&#39;s property?
bounwXLkme4,And how was your answer?
bounwXLkme4,@Karen Ness Thanks for the references Karen. Happy Holidays
bounwXLkme4,"@Randy Hilton I suggest you investigate the history of the jury a little bit further, starting with the Magna Charta, article XXIX, the interpretation of an abolitionist lawyer: An Essay on the Trial by Jury, and the opinion of the dissenting judge in Sparf and Hansen vs the United States 156 US 51 (1895).<br>The constitutional right of the People to decide if a person accused has violated the Law is annulled if they are denied the power to determine if the legislation in question is Law or arbitrary legislation arrived at through a political process, in other words, the competition for power among politicians, at the expense of the power of the People to defend themselves from government errors and abuses.<br>You can also get a free e-book of the Civic Dictionary if you have Amazon Prime.  It outlines step by step the dynamics of Society and politics.  If you don&#39;t have Prime, you can get it for $0.99.  If you understand Spanish:  <a href=""http://lexicocivico.com/"">lexicocivico.com</a>, also free."
bounwXLkme4,"@Karen Ness The jury simply decides if a law was violated, not whether that law is moral or ethical. Many laws are neither moral or ethical, some of those are still undoubtedly on the books. Societies can change their views over time with both knowledge and empathy of circumstances previously overlooked, whether intentional or not."
bounwXLkme4,"@Spiral Dynamics According to the Kohlberg&#39;s theory,  Karen Ness is at stage 4 of moral development, and Spiral Dynamic is at stage 6, thus, Karen just unable to comprehend the reasonings representing the higher stage of development"
bounwXLkme4,"I would have done what the husband did.  That this is even a situation, life or money, says sooo much about our society.  This is going on in the great USA on a daily basis, it is not some made up story. So morally, I am 100 percent with the husband."
bounwXLkme4,@SiMe 👌👌
bounwXLkme4,Should we enforce a blood tax?
bounwXLkme4,"Not right to life is being violated because there is no active killing taking place. If the right to life is more important then you are saying that you and everybody you know are killers because you don&#39;t donate everything you have to saving people all over the world from dying. Just because one didn&#39;t provide you with a service and you died because of it, does not make the other person a murderer or make your rights violating action proper. I&#39;m not saying that stealing was immoral in that instance btw. If he values the life of his wife more than his imprisonment then it is necessarily moral for him to steal. He would just have to face the consequences as a member of a rational governmental system. He did violate the rights of the pharmacist after all while the pharmacist just did his job and did not violate the rights of anybody."

bounwXLkme4,"​@Japanthewoman Simply without rank. A presentation of the type : here is a sketch of 6 differents point of view that can impact our moral. I would insist on the sketch because that&#39;s obviously not a scientific certainty. And it&#39;s more honest.<br>There is 3 things in the 6th point that trigger me so hard:<br>- The study presents the teacher as a spiritual guide. It&#39;s said that he have the quality to be *empathic*, he have *compassion*, etc. Where does it come from? Just present him with neutral interest like the others. The praiseworthy excess that is made to him is ridiculous. In addition to that it is placed at the very top of the hierarchy, as if he held the absolute truth. That&#39;s stupid.<br>- The caricatural of the old man &quot;infinite source of infinite wisdom&quot;. With that, the emblematic teacher/principal who symbolize authority and other things.<br>- He was not involved in the fight. I&#39;m pretty sure he would have another point of view if he was involved. It&#39;s ok in the study, for discribe the different point of view people can have. But add to the fact he is put above others it&#39;s pathetic from the study.<br>It allows me to suggest, according to your request, that the sutdy can be present with a degree of involvement in a situation. That can explain why the news tell us the nationality of people, why do we react differently depending on whether it&#39;s a stranger or a loved one, etc."
bounwXLkme4,"Yeah, I cringed at the term &quot;universal ethical principle.&quot; It has a very Western vibe to it to think your morality is the best. I doubt there was much diversity with the boys he interviewed beyond their age.<br>Maybe a 3 part venn diagram would have been better. Especially because I think our morals change not only with age but with the situation. How would you suggest the information should have been presented instead of stairs?"
bounwXLkme4,How long does this sick wife have that she can wait for the outcome of a lawsuit to get the medicine. What country are you from with any sort of <i>efficient</i> legal system?
bounwXLkme4,Price-gouging drug manufacturers are a lot more like the mafia:  causing many deaths and getting rich off other people&#39;s fear and suffering.
bounwXLkme4,"@Farjad Raza please read Talos&#39;s comment, and contemplate what they are saying in their comment. This process of thought leads to growth, it&#39;s good for us."
bounwXLkme4,"@Farjad Raza In the original scenario he actually tried a bunch of different ways, offering to pay in installments, bartering, and so on. However with time pressed he was faced with the reality of A. Steal. B. Let wife die. This is a hypothetical. The purpose is to remove the nuances and alternate possibilities of real life in order to isolate ones logic and figure out how they would be most likely to act given a real life situation in which they are left with two options. You are trying to outsmart the hypothetical, not answer the question."
bounwXLkme4,Yes I thought of the same thing. But the wife would have died. This means I would be paralyzed and would not be able to do anything if I could not try another pharmacist.
bounwXLkme4,@Trench Coat Doggo  but was he a hundred percent sure that by only this drug he could save his wife what if even by the drug she died what then? The robbery he went through was all for nothing then. And if she lived what would her wife think about his deed? Would she be satisfied with it. And what if  the drug dealer filed a case against him the wife would have to live her life separated from her husband as his husband would be in jail
bounwXLkme4,"Yes, but in every moment he wastes time, his wife will slowly get more sick until it would be too late to save her. <br><br>If there were more time he would have been able to find alternative ways to help his wife but it&#39;s implied in the video that she didn&#39;t. <br><br>Since it looked like she was so sick and she her face expressing a feeling of discomfort and pain that her body isn&#39;t healthy enough to get off the bed, which is a sign of terminal illness getting worse..."
bounwXLkme4,We are working on this one! It&#39;s coming soon :)
bounwXLkme4,"Universal healthcare should be payed for by the over priced nonessential products capitalism has plagued us with....thats my answer to all of them"
bounwXLkme4,I agree with all these points
bounwXLkme4,@Dragon &amp; Co Mosaics Because we don&#39;t know why actually the cost of the medicine is 10x. It could have been because of the high demand of the medicine and the medicine companies not having enough facilities to provide for all. They could be doing this to get enough money to buy equipment and get medicine for all. I don&#39;t that&#39;s wrong at all.
bounwXLkme4,"@Go Ahead, Make My Day Martin Skreli much the piece of shit is still in prison (unfortunately not for price gauging) but ethically can we blame someone for taking advantage of a system in which encourages such corruption and profiteering? He&#39;s literally doing exactly what every other big pharma company does except he was turned into a meme and became a target for being openly pathological about it, was audited, and sentenced. <br><br>but the fact we live in a society where that is in fact the case, is horribly unethical."
bounwXLkme4,"For the The Sake of All and a common well Why Our Society allows Such and important pharmacos to be Only managed By the Private Sector only , Private Sector Have the Right to exercise Commerce on a free market , but The Market Most Provide An generic alternative Through other channel, <br>Social Contract Mr pharmacy Guy please keep on selling the drug But you most also Sell have of Your stock To a second channel For a generic option The Interest of all above your only one interest."
bounwXLkme4,Thanks Abraham!
bounwXLkme4,"In Point 2, it is only different from his own self interest. From a general moral perspective, it would still save a life...?"
bounwXLkme4,@un mog That means high taxes for the medical insurance
bounwXLkme4,"@Mr MisanthropeI 100% agree with you for the first three, however, charging high prices is unethical, not illegal. He is fully allowed to charge the price he wants. That being said though, the pharmacist is a huge dick for not lowering the price as you said, or give the medicine through a payment plan as op said."

mhG-twzaE_g,"I don&#39;t know about you, but I have vivid memory of (broadly) sexual thoughts and drive from before the age of 8."
mhG-twzaE_g,"@Rod Fleming The consensus? Not even close. Cite your sources then. The most extensive twin study was the Minnesota Twin Study which showed a 54% concordance rate. I don&#39;t know of ANY study that puts the number at 80%. Your view was the the prevailing view from about 1995-2010 but the pendulum is shifting the other way again, and as psychedelic research takes off and people truly relive their traumas on a deep level and not just in talk therapy, you will see more views in this direction. The fact that many people are able to completely remake themselves in deep psychotherapy should tell you its not genetic. Perhaps you are confusing cause/effect with genetic predisposition.<br><br> Genetics set the template, but without the environmental influence, forget about it. That&#39;s true on everything from alcoholism to schizophrenia to borderline personality to psycopathy. I&#39;m not a constructionist at all, I&#39;ve just read the research. Unfortunately the geneticists are in denial of their own traumatic childhoods, which nearly EVERYONE has. Anyway, I&#39;m all ears if you can cite your research. Show me some sound research, multiple and  replicable research with theoretical triangulation that shows this 80% influence on mental illness. <br><br>I can also speak from personal experience. I suffered from deep depression as well as various addictions. When I was able to relive the repressed emotions, not just talk about them, I went completely off of antidepressants, have no desire for any of my addictions, even my blood pressure dropped into the normal range, skin problems disappeared, and my allergies and asthma reduced drastically. Of course I&#39;m just one person, and I&#39;m not denying genetic influences at all. But its predisposition, not causal. No researcher worth his salt will deny this. The prevailing view is DEFINITELY that there is a predisposition."
mhG-twzaE_g,"@Antonio Sciara nope. Currently the consensus is 80% genetic/innate, 20% environmental/learned. Constructionists don&#39;t like that but since they&#39;re wrong about everything else..."
mhG-twzaE_g,"@Rod Fleming Doesn&#39;t depend on your upbringing? Upbringing is everything. No matter what your genes are. When you are raised in a loving, accepting home with minimal abuse, its a slam dunk that you are going to be a well-adjusted adult. Likewise, those from abusive homes, with the exception of a few, those are your drug addicts, borderline personalities, etc. The correlation is extremely high. In fact, there is no such thing as an alcoholic or drug addict who is not from a highly dysfunctional home."
mhG-twzaE_g,"I&#39;m just gonna say he was right about everything being about sex, the way he interpreted the reasons was hi trying to feel smart and use his logical experience to claim wha the felt inside but you can&#39;t do that so thats where he fucked up but trust me from experience everything is."
mhG-twzaE_g,Freud had to have been on something while making that. The more i learn about him the less i understand why he is so popular

mhG-twzaE_g,Brandi j Adams
mhG-twzaE_g,Seems like a reasonable response.
mhG-twzaE_g,to me it just sounds like being trans
mhG-twzaE_g,Its a theory of a dead man theyre just covering. Chill
mhG-twzaE_g,🤣nice one
mhG-twzaE_g,Someone got abused 🤔
mhG-twzaE_g,Thank you Deepak Fialok!
mhG-twzaE_g,right? I was wondering why no one was talking about that part
mhG-twzaE_g,@red dunkey thanks for help buddy !
mhG-twzaE_g,@red dunkey true
mhG-twzaE_g,certainly not if you have a weak father
mhG-twzaE_g,Men&#39;s power
mhG-twzaE_g,"I think that more than people being amazed, he was really criticized, and i’m not saying that some people weren’t amazed or interested by what he said (He had his whole Wednesday gang), however, in those times what explained behavior had a lot to do with science (We had Pavlov, Thorndike, and well, everything regarding human behavior had to do with science/medicine/psychiatry), they thought that well, we can control the entire part of ourselves, that there is a way to control it, but the psychoanalysis was one the hits that damaged the ego of humanity (another one, for example, was that the earth wasn’t the center of the universe), it was a hit because in psychoanalysis it implies that we don’t have absolute control of what’s on our mind, and that was really criticized <br>A lot of things that he said were controversial, a good example are the things said in this video and you can even see it on the comments (imagine if it’s a shock nowadays, how much of a shock must have been in his time), and well, of course if you just watch this video without reading more in depth about the topic, this theory might come off way more crazy than it really is<br>There were also times were he said one thing in one text and later on said to never mind what he stated previously and changed what he said<br>He was really questionable in some things (maybe in a lot), but overall a lot of things that he stated, his theories, are the bases of what we currently know as psychotherapy, of course, as all things, they develop and there are new authors with new contributions in the psychoanalysis field that, overall, help the psychology field."
mhG-twzaE_g,I think it was because he was the first to do talk therapy and actually listen to his patients and that he chose to look at the deeper roots of a psychological problem rather than trying to just treat the surface symptom of a deeper issue. That being said the guy was a complete crackhead.
mhG-twzaE_g,Freud was influenced my cultural values and during the years he practiced as a psychoanalyst people were amazed by his theories because there were no other known explanations for abnormal behavior.
mhG-twzaE_g,Yikes. Now that you mention it...
mhG-twzaE_g,yeah Freud did lol
mhG-twzaE_g,It does tho....
mhG-twzaE_g,that was good lmao
mhG-twzaE_g,This is why more female sex offenders have dominance/power and control as motive than men do. Because society gave a toxic idea about sex.
mhG-twzaE_g,you may have a talent for story writing
mhG-twzaE_g,Fkn Hans
mhG-twzaE_g,yes.
mhG-twzaE_g,"Yes. Its all based on very simple human psychology and some of its functions. However, it does not have to be correct for everyone as we all experience traumatic events on a different level so from the same traumatic event, one could grow up to be completely fine while the other could have long lasting effects if thats what you were wondering."
mhG-twzaE_g,maybe
mhG-twzaE_g,Homophobic Parents be like: “What have I done?! 😢”
mhG-twzaE_g,I also had a similar class “Child Growth and Development”. I finished with an A. And just completed my Associates Degree this year.
mhG-twzaE_g,"Dont get worked up over things and turn against them just because it seems incomprehensible at this point. Everything can be comprehended and understood, it just takes time, research, and a good motive. Take it step by step in the right direction and u can find out any truth you wish to know."
mhG-twzaE_g,"nah pretty much all of these consequences could source from other things too. I got a problem with authority too (if it could even be called that, basically i always strive to get control if i have a way of doing so) and it damn sure aint from what they said in the video lol. I was quite the great shitter back in the day actually...lmao"
mhG-twzaE_g,Great to know!
mhG-twzaE_g,"I feel ya, I spent a good amount of time during that phase just playing ps2 games and being lonely with low self esteem cause I didn&#39;t know how to handle verbal bullying at the time. Living in a city theres a not a whole lot i could just go do outside that I was interested in. Precious digital pacifier."
mhG-twzaE_g,Right there with you man.
mhG-twzaE_g,"@Rae Ryuko So you&#39;re saying, despite the evidence before our very eyes, 3rd wave feminism, SJW&#39;s, Cancel culture, etc...<br><br>You&#39;re telling me Freud is COMPLETELY wrong, simply because you dislike his reasoning, because you don&#39;t like how he arrived at his conclusions? :P<br><br>Bruh, Freud was around before psychology was even an established field of science... it was in it&#39;s infancy stage at that point.<br><br>And somehow his method proves to have some truth to it, show some respect for historic figures, ya numpty. -_-&#39;<br>Almost every case of primitive science guess-work in history has proven to be at least PARTIALLY correct or SURPRISINGLY accurate... People in the past were more intelligent than you think. :P<br><br>Doesn&#39;t matter if you dislike or disagree, the evidence speaks for itself, and MUST be acknowledged. : /<br><br>Freuds theory EXPLAINS said evidence, so his theory can&#39;t be COMPLETE bogus. I&#39;m not saying he was COMPLETELY right, i&#39;m just saying he was onto something. :P"
mhG-twzaE_g,"?????<br>Dude, he probably just thought about the people he knew in real life and then make up a &quot;reasoning&quot; for why they turned out like that<br>It&#39;s completely ridiculous if you think about it with common sense"
mhG-twzaE_g,🤗
mhG-twzaE_g,@bugbugbug human
mhG-twzaE_g,diagnose uou as what😰
mhG-twzaE_g,"We have much to thank him for, but he was a man, not a god, and he had flaws just like the rest of us. Some of his theories still ring true, and his influence was major, but there are some real whoppers where he went off track. Look, nobody can see the back of their head without a mirror, you know? We all have our limits. Take the best of what he had to offer and leave the rest to the historians..."
mhG-twzaE_g,😂
mhG-twzaE_g,Right 😂
mhG-twzaE_g,LIKE PLEASE I HATE HIM SM HES SO WRONG ??? CAN WE COLLECTIVELY REPRESS THE IDEA OF SIGMUND FREUD
mhG-twzaE_g,I punched my father&#39;s ball when I saw they were kissing. My mother told me LOL
mhG-twzaE_g,It hurts to accept that
mhG-twzaE_g,You’re famous????

mhG-twzaE_g,@prince othello  you have a better chance winning the lottery twice than finding  a gay guy that has a good relationship with his dad...
mhG-twzaE_g,The flaw in Freud’s theory:  there are guys who have a good relationship with their fathers and turn out to be gay.
mhG-twzaE_g,"Nah , not really"
mhG-twzaE_g,Most likely.
mhG-twzaE_g,you might be interested in psychology?? idk lol
mhG-twzaE_g,aye good job on getting it my boy
mhG-twzaE_g,Yes I feel like there&#39;s alot of truths in this though tbh
mhG-twzaE_g,Now you put it that way I can accept it 😂😂 but penis envy was just hilarious to me😂😂😂😂
mhG-twzaE_g,I think you missed the point. It&#39;s meant to be both - literal and metaphorical. Which puts a different spin on things entirely...
mhG-twzaE_g,@6 9 me an asexual girl*
mhG-twzaE_g,We male too envy what women have: their keen sense of understanding behaviour and choosing mates. If we understood that we&#39;d find sexual partners more easily. But yes with sustainable struggles and ideas to work through the competition.
mhG-twzaE_g,Traumas can affect our brain structure in childhood
mhG-twzaE_g,@first name last name omg the legends are true!<br>I have always heard that such a man exists! One who is so powerful and so well known all fear him! The man who has no numbers! The original first name last name! He really exists! I know first name1 last name1 but i never believed you exist!
mhG-twzaE_g,Especially when you wake up.
mhG-twzaE_g,😅<br>Oh man
mhG-twzaE_g,"Thanks mate, I learn new words."
mhG-twzaE_g,"@Michael Furia ur being slightly over analytical about things, i think"
mhG-twzaE_g,cool!
mhG-twzaE_g,Same but it’s 2 am
mhG-twzaE_g,Who knows
mhG-twzaE_g,Who tf liked this
mhG-twzaE_g,Yup basically.
mhG-twzaE_g,A blue waffle
mhG-twzaE_g,"It&#39;s just a theory, one that Freud himself abandoned later in life. The only reason it&#39;s relevant is because of how many people continued to believe in it."
mhG-twzaE_g,Normal.
mhG-twzaE_g,"True, and when i hard that Ida has (you know what) envy, i thought that she(sorry i meant he) might be a trans men who grew up with transphobic parents"
mhG-twzaE_g,Women go from envy to desire.
mhG-twzaE_g,I went to search for someone who heard it too loll. I had to replay it to see if i heard correctly
mhG-twzaE_g,It’s even funnier because his daughter Anna Freud was clearly sapphic.
mhG-twzaE_g,"@FMAYasha12 I think you’re a pretty functional human, but you have to see the irony here right? LOL"
mhG-twzaE_g,"@Josef Yes, Freud said it"
mhG-twzaE_g,Freuds words not his
mhG-twzaE_g,@Angel Rose google lol<br>I don&#39;t understand y&#39;all feminists<br>the 97% UK statistic was fake and y&#39;all believed that and now suddenly you want proof..why? Cuz is something that don&#39;t boost your ego and you don&#39;t like it
mhG-twzaE_g,"@Angel Rose ik, but there are more abusive mothers and not taken accountable than abusive fathers, especially in the western/with feminist influence countries"
mhG-twzaE_g,@Angel Rose probably cuz there are a lot of abusive moms not taken accountable for their actions
mhG-twzaE_g,Like 90% of the time
mhG-twzaE_g,Naw penis envy is real. Id go into more detail but id prefer not to
mhG-twzaE_g,"That&#39;s why you ask stuff anonymously, so people will answer it honestly."
mhG-twzaE_g,"but you have to take into consideration that Freud was addicted to cocaine and that none of his theories were backed up by evidence. He was convincing his patients that they had gone through childhood trauma that they don’t remember. He’s theories are subjective and not scientific, so most probably he’s wrong."
mhG-twzaE_g,I don&#39;t like my father but like thinking to get rid of my father is kinda stupid
mhG-twzaE_g,"I totally get what you&#39;re saying. These constructs take on the functional nature of the personalities that conceive them, but even so, can we doubt the profound utility of Newton&#39;s principles or Einstein conceptions? Newtons explanations may not be actual reality or the meaning another person will construct from the same data, but his derived principles are still spot-on in being able to make predictions that are extremely accurate and useful. We owe almost our entire modern existence to the operating principles derived from these ill-conceived explanations. So even though we may not agree with the particular meaning one constructs from the same data, it should not be lost on us that our inability to see past that and look at the value of people&#39;s contribution is a failing of our own. A wise person will look towards its utility and accept that people are flawed and different, and seek to make their own contributions rather than seek as sense of validation from attacking the ideas of others that have been of great utility to mankind."
mhG-twzaE_g,"You can make a good sense, if less ironic, cause you lose logic the moment you start like that 😉"
mhG-twzaE_g,@Compa Check about &quot;Freudian cover-up&quot; 🙃
mhG-twzaE_g,"@Abhinav oh, sorry, i didn&#39;t mean to be offensive"
mhG-twzaE_g,"@Compa No. It was you who understood what (s)he wanted to. <br>I support psychodynamic approach and psychoanalysis till by last breath, and also &quot;beyond the pleasure principle&quot; but certainly not works like this on infantile sexuality. And BTW, Carl Jung, his disciple, departed because of this thing. And he&#39;s more pertinent to modern times and reality than freud could ever be with his weird generalisations of own mind to others. Just because someone developed a good method, say calculus by newton, or Relativity by Einstein, doesnt mean they&#39;re always correct. Viz Newton failed b/c of religious instincts and Einstein rejected QM- the ultimate reality. <br>Similarly goes for freud."

mhG-twzaE_g,"@ツAcidicAli777 Yeah, but so were many people at that time because it was thought of as a miracle drug"
mhG-twzaE_g,"@*oof oof* Freud saw castration anxiety as the counterpart to penis envy, but I&#39;ve heard people speak of vagina envy or womb envy as well."
mhG-twzaE_g,Well its oversimplified for starters

mhG-twzaE_g,@A man of culture um- I am going into to gender studies so. What proof do you have 😊
mhG-twzaE_g,"Actually yes , you had a bad education"
mhG-twzaE_g,I know it at 12 when all my my friends did it at 8
mhG-twzaE_g,Bruhhhh 3 I new girls were different
mhG-twzaE_g,I was right when I thought all men had a wee and women had none
mhG-twzaE_g,"People go through theses phases on different ages, it&#39;s not always on the &quot;recommended&quot; ages, there&#39;s also phases fixations when we are growing up, you probably couldnt move on from a specific phase for a long time and it took longer to get to the genital phase. It happened like that for me, it&#39;s not unusual."
mhG-twzaE_g,@Raccoonraccoon Raccoonraccoon I see.<br><br>But it had to feel a bit weird and uncomfortable at first though right?
mhG-twzaE_g,@Ryan Blanche not really. I was taught all that at a young age
mhG-twzaE_g,"@Nat C I dont care, I&#39;m going to a gender psychiatrist and she didn&#39;t tell me anything about me being just a faker, so I dont believe you anyway."
mhG-twzaE_g,"@SunshinePIRRATA sounds like peter pan syndrome, not gender dysphoria"
mhG-twzaE_g,"Penis envy actually refers to the idea that many of a woman’s problems in life come from her gender, and that she would be much better off if she was born a man. But using it in a study that’s supposed to be taken seriously is laughable"
mhG-twzaE_g,@Mike Ockburns Why do i need to hate myself to be valid? Thatd stupid.
mhG-twzaE_g,@SunshinePIRRATA You arent valid. You&#39;re desperate for attention and internet points.

mhG-twzaE_g,@gary trunsik not everything is about sex human beings are a lot more complicated than that + some people lack sexual desires so it&#39;s not an essential part in everyone&#39;s life and can&#39;t be the cause of everything
mhG-twzaE_g,"I&#39;m just gonna say he was right about everything being about sex, the way he interpreted the reasons was him trying to feel smart and use his intellectual status to claim what he felt inside but you can&#39;t do that so that&#39;s where he fucked up but trust me everything is about sex and sexuality"
mhG-twzaE_g,@GTA and Apple channel yeah it does fit somewhere I guess
mhG-twzaE_g,But it’s does look like a poorly function key though

mhG-twzaE_g,"&quot;Eda experiences penis envy. She thinks this is the key to power and domination and also <b>wants</b> one&quot; I don&#39;t know if it means she desires a man in order to have a sensation of power, or if she wants to be a man."
mhG-twzaE_g,"That&#39;s a fact,my buddy."
mhG-twzaE_g,<b>You cannot escape libido</b> /j
mhG-twzaE_g,Totally agree
mhG-twzaE_g,Wut? Why is that good?
mhG-twzaE_g,"@MK not some, *most. I’m criticizing his extreme irrationality, most hypothetic propositions he made were not based on evidential principles. He essentially made things up in his mind with no theorem to support his hypothesis and simply stated these things were the absolute truth with no factual consensus. He was very irrational."
mhG-twzaE_g,"@Jazeah Luster Everything you said, Freud did, but given that the human sciences are very complex, and that man is not a laboratory material, this field remains for the most part theoretical.<br>The mistake I see many of you making is that you take everything he says at face value. Freud is much more abstract than you thought.<br>Freud gave theories, some of them are approved and have changed the human sciences in a revolutionary way, others have been widely criticized. To spit on scientist only because some of his theories are difficult to accept is ignorance."
mhG-twzaE_g,"@MK I’m confused…A logical equation would be proposed with general reasoning, and an evidential basis. this is what makes a theorem logical in the first place. if something is not rational, based on theoretical principles, or mathematically determinate then it cannot be considered logical, as it is an anomaly of reasoning."
mhG-twzaE_g,"@Jazeah Luster Logical does not necessarily mean scientifically proven. Psychology is not an exact science like mathematics for example. Anyway, I don&#39;t feel like debating on this subject. If you don&#39;t like the research of a dead man because he doesn&#39;t support your progressive ideals, that&#39;s your business. But whether you like it or not, he made science evolve in a remarkable way."
mhG-twzaE_g,"@MK …logical? He proposed his ideas with hypothetical principles, he based nothing with theorems and blindly linked things that had no evidential basis. he even proposed everyone has a degree of sexual hermaphroditism, which of course can be disproven simply by dissection any mammalian organism. there’s no traces nor direct or indirect display of the opposite sex’s reproductive composition. There’s absolutely nothing factual about such statements and he simply came up with different hypothetical ideas, with no consensus or theorem to support his ideas."

mhG-twzaE_g,He was a bit odd
mhG-twzaE_g,"Seriously, are you really that young? If so wtf is a 14 year old child social media socializing with a bunch of un-educated, hyper aroused, misinformed comment trolls?

People usually look for similar qualities as their own which usually correspond to their parents&#39; qualities. I am sure if someone has a shitty dad or mom and they are aware of it, they won&#39;t look for the same qualities in their partner just because of a strong deep urge to fuck their parents. Freud was right for some things, but for the wrong reasons. It&#39;s like he was turned on every time he came up with theories or projected his own thoughts over those same theories."
mhG-twzaE_g,"@IdiotChips I mean it might apply, if you think about it. I&#39;m not saying I agree tho"
mhG-twzaE_g,@bee Nope ... Theories must be rational so your generalization doesn&#39;t apply to that situation or what ?
mhG-twzaE_g,@Ismael Barrera <br>PFFFTT you must have a pretty small mind to think that reproduction is the only purpose in life.
mhG-twzaE_g,@Ismael Barrera <br>Duh I have no genetic future. Do you understand what asexual means? XD
mhG-twzaE_g,@Flex tape Sealin you all up Just because you weren&#39;t actively thinking it doesn&#39;t mean that you didn&#39;t subconsciously believe it or act it out.
mhG-twzaE_g,Same
mhG-twzaE_g,"Fast Boi productions Just seeing these replies now.<br><br>I made the joke about my sexuality because it’s 100% relevant to the topic of the video. <br><br>The ideas discussed in the video are incompatible with asexuality existing. Meanwhile, they aren’t incompatible with heterosexuality. That’s why you wouldn’t see straight ppl making a similar joke"
mhG-twzaE_g,@Dr. Man straight ppl dont do that cause it&#39;s &#39;the norm&#39; and everyone just assume ur straight so u have to tell ppl and this comment makes sense if u know what asexual means
mhG-twzaE_g,"@Jimmy Dean Propaganda for who though? There aren&#39;t&#39; many people, on either side of the aisle who still subscribe to Freud&#39;s outdated ideas."

mhG-twzaE_g,Basically GTAV Trevor
mhG-twzaE_g,@Miles Gaunt <br><br>Well my father and mother never divorce.<br>   But out of me and my three sisters one sister was the only one not divorced. But she was so liberal I couldn&#39;t stand her and she couldn&#39;t stand me.<br>   What&#39;s my point ? I had about enough of all this hopeless change
mhG-twzaE_g,People just use the word simp without knowing what it means huh
mhG-twzaE_g,@Steven Gu hmmmm seems like someone had troubles with their poop traing
mhG-twzaE_g,"@TheCapatalistPropagator _ I don&#39;t think it is about an abandonment of natural roles but more of the fact that in the modern world, families need both the father and mother working to make enough money to sustain a household. Plus, more women are seeking to advance their own careers than have tons and tons of babies. In truth, however, the population decline is not serious at all since the human population is at the billions. I think we got way too many human beings than is sustainable on this planet."
mhG-twzaE_g,@Steven Gu Actually since 1950s the innovation of incredible healthcare which made sure that you give birth to two kids and 99% they will survive changed the meaning of fittest will survive . Acc to nature fittest to survive means ability of a species to pass its genes to next generation .<br>Right now we are living in a world in where some parts are facing human depopulation crisis very absurd and unprecedented as people have abandoned the natural  roles to be obligated <br>Will be interesting to see what happens in few years
mhG-twzaE_g,"@TheCapatalistPropagator _ Well, the modern world is not all about sex and reproduction simply because human beings decided to throw morality into hyperdrive. Morality was a useful human invention for the survival of the species but it also became the deciding factor of who is more &#39;fit&#39; to reproduce."
mhG-twzaE_g,Freud would tell you that it is thanks to a trauma
mhG-twzaE_g,@Well Prepared Cat Damn. Do I get to keep some left? Please?
mhG-twzaE_g,"@Polarisque we will inject the extracted asexuality into the writers of media, and the world will no longer be filled with weird asf lust bees bessjjjhhelpme"
mhG-twzaE_g,"@Polarisque never, you have been lured here, and you will be experimented on. We must extract all ounces of asexuality for testing, to de-sexualize the media."
mhG-twzaE_g,When can i let go of this chair?
mhG-twzaE_g,it do be like that
mhG-twzaE_g,also the part that the son has the wish to get rid of his father seems rather questionable
mhG-twzaE_g,"I dont want to be angry anymore, i just want to shit in a potty"
mhG-twzaE_g,Has your child started asking certain questions though?
mhG-twzaE_g,"@Well Prepared Cat Jokes on you, I&#39;m a junkie! 😅 lololol jkjk... my name is from a song not about actual heroin"
mhG-twzaE_g,I don&#39;t understand why they are all so sadly super aggressive and feel a need to discredit a pioneer in the field in mental health?
mhG-twzaE_g,Ily already
mhG-twzaE_g,"Ah yes, the true facts of life."
mhG-twzaE_g,"I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s not, I don&#39;t think my mother has &quot;penis envy.&quot; I don&#39;t think he&#39;s joking though"
mhG-twzaE_g,I can’t tell if men think this is true or is you guys are joking
mhG-twzaE_g,"It could. Sadly, some people feel the need to project their negative emotions of other people- a lot of the time it&#39;s not just because of their gender. Like, sexist people have most likely had connections with people of the opposite gender, right? But they still think that gender plays a role in intelligence level for some reason."
mhG-twzaE_g,?????????????
mhG-twzaE_g,SAME-
mhG-twzaE_g,LOL! I Know Right.
mhG-twzaE_g,yeah this idea feels suck
mhG-twzaE_g,@Asturianix98 Hell yeah
mhG-twzaE_g,@Wilhelm von N He once recommended cocaine to one patient as a way to cure his addiction to morphine. He ended being addictive to both and he said it was his fault for having a bad administration lol
mhG-twzaE_g,He actually recommended cocaine as an aid to clear thinking.  Yeah right ...
mhG-twzaE_g,Lol
mhG-twzaE_g,<i>💀</i>
mhG-twzaE_g,akshuly yeth.. but he called it &#39;slip&#39; not &#39;slap&#39;
mhG-twzaE_g,No doubt
mhG-twzaE_g,his name wasn´t  ´´joy´´ for nichts
mhG-twzaE_g,What?
mhG-twzaE_g,"Pretended? Nope, he was one of the first psycologist as it wasn&#39;t a very liked thing before him. He worked with the info he had at the time, which isn&#39;t as good as current info. Lot&#39;s of what he said was right, and lot&#39;s was wrong. He paved the way for psychology becoming normal and it now considered a science (albeit, the worst one by many)"
mhG-twzaE_g,Well he married his mother.
mhG-twzaE_g,@Dr. Be yes
mhG-twzaE_g,dya feel better now..?
mhG-twzaE_g,"That&#39;s a fact,my friend."
mhG-twzaE_g,"Yeah, it&#39;s not completely the child&#39;s fault but the child is still responsible for his/her actions."
mhG-twzaE_g,"Yeah, but when you realize you&#39;re wrong, it&#39;s your fault."
mhG-twzaE_g,Possible.
mhG-twzaE_g,pls no
mhG-twzaE_g,"Lucky you. LOL At what age did you start noticing the anatomy differences?<br>My parents were pretty strict, so I didn&#39;t know what the female anatomy looked like until around 5th Grade when I was around 11."

mhG-twzaE_g,"@septimius the destroyer As an adult with a bigger brain, she hated me for having her ex our dad&#39;s name. When she looks at me, she can see him, through my name..."
mhG-twzaE_g,"100% not. I was a kid and my Mom was/is a single Mom of 4. I was a curious kid and always got in trouble because of it. One morning, I wake up and remember that the carpenters working on the yard had left a nice pile of sand just outside on the side of the house from the back kitchen door. <br><br>Idk what led me but I went into my Mom&#39;s closet and started fumbling around. She used to take away my Sega Genesis, games and controllers and stash them in her dirty clothing or somewhere crammed in her closet behind heavy packed pieces of luggage. <br><br>I kept digging deeper and found a few boxes of morning glory, those little stick fireworks you give to a toddler to wave around because it sparkled and harmless unless used stupidly. So I grab the boxes of morning glory and rush to the pile of sand with my plastic toy soldiers and other toys with my younger brother and he had his action figures too. So through the power of time and imagination, our toys suddenly became engulfed in some fantasy scenario and we started to have fun. We got some of the sticks, starting making noises as if our toys were about to do a special,  (we were too young to know what a &quot;special&quot; is in gaming like MvC2 special down forward double punch type deal) so we let the sticks one after the other or at the same time at a distance to see some of our less popular toys get torched by the morning glory, it was at least 8-9am on a Saturday morning this was maybe 1995-1996 not even the year 2000 yet. <br><br>Then my Mom, my only Mom, because Dad left Mom with four kiddos all by herself and she never remarries or pair up.(I kinda resent her for that today being 31 and learning how to be a man from the worst of examples) She storms outside and by this time the fireworks are used and burned out, some of our toys are about burned but they look &quot;cool&quot; because of the burns. Me and my brother were on the pile of sand again, playing with our toys and our imagination is where it should be, on our toys...because we&#39;re kids...little boys...<br><br>My Mom begins to interrogate me in Spanish, where did you get those cuetes? Where did you get them? I had them planned for *faded memory*. She gets mad, first she takes an ear and lifts me up, then smacks me across the face, spanks me, all in front of my younger brother, I also have an older brother and a sister...she takes my arm and drags me from the sand, my toys, and up the 4 concrete steps into the titled kitchen floor where she then begins to shout at me in Spanish, shouting &quot;You can&#39;t keep your hands off anything. Why do you have to put your hands on everything?This will teach you to never put your hands on anything ever again!&quot; The burner was on, she did not hesitate, the fire spewed out of the stove top burners like lovely razor blades, blue and orange tipped, the flame on high and my young boy eyes are staring at this flame as my own Mother with force takes my hands and takes them towards the fire! I&#39;m shouting for help, I&#39;m calling for my brothers shouting, then I begin to see my own burned hands at school, in the classroom, I begin to see myself in a class, with a sad face and burned hands in class. At that moment, I overpowered my Mom and used all the life in my young body to push against the stove, to direct my hands towards the tile countertop of center of the stove because she was bringing my hands to the flame. I push off away from the stove, Mom is on the ground and I run away from the house...I run to a grassy corner in the front of the house truly visible and I just crouch down and sit in a corner looking at purple and pink flowers and 3 fat bushy pine trees as I took in what just happened. <br><br>I had nowhere to go, my brain thought about calling child services on my Mom but if I did, I&#39;d have no parents, neither would my two brothers and sister if I had called or something...but I didn&#39;t. I&#39;m not sure what came first how she beat me in my sleep demanding me a child for the date when I will change or when she tried to burn my hands among other things. Oh and the girlfriends I had growing up, she hated every single one, even though some were home runs and had good lives going for themselves. Once I briefly dated a nurse who dressed nicely one afternoon after a job interview at a clinic near my home so she could visit after work. Mom disrespects her, doesn&#39;t even look at her and at the same time, she&#39;s scolding me and intimidating me regarding &quot;girls&quot; in her home....... <br><br>She&#39;s 61 now...miserable, alone and restless. I know she knows she&#39;s crazy and I know she knows what she did to me and it&#39;s not easy for her to live as a Mother that tried to burn her young boy&#39;s hands off and literally mounted his young body and beat him out of sleep demanding when the boy she is beating will become a man (that will essentially get a job and pay her &quot;rent&quot; as was her motto when I got my first job at 17 and 3/4 at a grocery store. She wanted half my check, I unaware of the value of money because of the lack of knowledge thereof, paid half my check for a moment until I began giving her bits to eventually question what I was doing giving my money to her, and she knew what she was doing. Even today, she still abuses me, making me feel like I&#39;m worth $300. <br><br>True story btw. And YouTube is the first to read it."
mhG-twzaE_g,"The brain is so strange also Why would anyone do that to a kid, sorry you experienced that :&#39;("
mhG-twzaE_g,"For anyone who doesn’t know female hysteria was a fictional disease created by psychologists at the time that basically said that a woman would go insane if she was sexually deprived or had low libido. Most people at this time thought that the uterus was a living creature of its own and there were many shocking and disturbing treatments performed on many women to “cure” this fake disease <br><br>1.Most commonly used in mental hospitals, they would force the legs open and shoot a jet powered hose up the vaginal canal into the uterus, usually caused injury, infertility, or death<br><br>2. Involuntary Sterilization, especially with women who were on the lower socioeconomic scale, women of color, and disabled women <br>3. Doctors would masturbate women or straight up penetrate them<br><br><br>Most people at the time assumed that this disease was real but we all know it wasn’t and that what these doctors were actually doing is rape/sexual abuse"
mhG-twzaE_g,Maybe other people have influenced you to be this way...like teachers or people you admire.
mhG-twzaE_g,A father is not supposed to teach his son to ignore his feelings rather to be stoic and control his feelings through a rational outlook
mhG-twzaE_g,It&#39;s real though i studied it
mhG-twzaE_g,"thought the same. I mean i am not proud of it, its currently fucking me in the ass and i&#39;m searching a way to turn this whole shitshow to a good side."
mhG-twzaE_g,Lol
mhG-twzaE_g,"That was the first lesson I was taught in psychology! “Kids, we’re gonna cover Freud, but only as a thought experiment rather than believing it’s all true, then we’ll move onto psychologists who actually have proof of their theories.”<br><br>We’d go over Freudian concepts, only so our teacher could ask us what we thought about it, rather than being taught it was reality. I found it fun, then we spent the next 6 months doing real psychology"
mhG-twzaE_g,Why do you have over three trillion cells in your body when they could have all been mine
mhG-twzaE_g,I was thinking the same thing
mhG-twzaE_g,Yeah same
mhG-twzaE_g,Never murder but I can’t say I looked up to him
mhG-twzaE_g,"Oh, so that’s just me, ok"
mhG-twzaE_g,Not saying this theory is correct tho
mhG-twzaE_g,"nah envy means you want to HAVE one, not have one in you."
mhG-twzaE_g,yea same
mhG-twzaE_g,"I think it&#39;s important to point out that these theories are one of the most influential in modern psychology - current therapies developed leading on from this (psychoanalytic psychotherapy) or in critical discourse with it (CBT). Freud published his works more than 100 years ago, when people with mental health problems ended up in asylums and psychology and psychological health was not realy a concept."
mhG-twzaE_g,No shit Sherlock!?!
mhG-twzaE_g,But what about the part about young boys and girls finding out about their anatomy differences?<br>At what age should they be taught about that? I always thought you should only teach them if they happen to notice and ask questions?
mhG-twzaE_g,"It has been said that around 5,6 or 7 your early memories fade and you don&#39;t start remembering until those ages.<br>Even if you do recall them, they&#39;re usually very vague."
mhG-twzaE_g,"You are right. Hopefully we will get to cover that topic too some day soon!

mhG-twzaE_g,I don’t think not pooping causes inSensitive bevhavor in adult hood

mhG-twzaE_g,This stage is heavily refuted since it was based on completely hypothetical principles.
mhG-twzaE_g,🤣🤣
mhG-twzaE_g,"Sexual desire isn&#39;t what you think it is. It&#39;s an intimate relationship and not necessarily the same intimacy as physical sex. By definition intimate means: 1) intrinsic 2) marked by very close association, contact or familiarity. 3) marked by a warm friendship. That&#39;s using the word intimate as an adjective. Using the word as a noun means an intimate friend, associate or confidant."
mhG-twzaE_g,@Lyon bro wtf-
mhG-twzaE_g,Not exactly
mhG-twzaE_g,Nope thats actually internalized misogyny not feminism. Feminism is the belief that all people are equal (what the video describes is the opposite).
mhG-twzaE_g,The huge amount of coke he snorted probably helped
mhG-twzaE_g,🙏
mhG-twzaE_g,Exactly. Even famous scientists in the past have wrong assumptions and theories but we can never deny that they&#39;ve contributed a lot to their field of study. Psychology was not yet fully explored in Freud&#39;s time and most of his theories are just his own observations which means he mostly made it from scratch. Can&#39;t people just spare him from bs?
mhG-twzaE_g,Most of the comments deny things because it offends them.
mhG-twzaE_g,"Everything is just probability, dang it."
mhG-twzaE_g,"@Vini Chenzo he is weird... But his method is... Effective to say at least... <br>His way of dealing with problem can be sum up as:<br>&quot;You have a psychological problem? Let me guess, childhood sexual abuse?&quot;<br>It&#39;s not right all the time... But 100% work 30-40% of the time."
mhG-twzaE_g,@Vini Chenzo YES!!! I thought the exact same thing!
mhG-twzaE_g,"Not sure what to say about that, but ok 😃"
mhG-twzaE_g,I thought this happened in real life for a second
mhG-twzaE_g,"Good for you. I, personally, do not believe that it is <i>necessarily</i> a phase that <i>all</i> little girls <i>must</i> go through. It depends on her personality, her parental upbringing, as well as her environment.<br>But I won&#39;t sweep it under the rug and ridicule it as something that doesn&#39;t exist just because in today&#39;s zeitgeist it offends a politically-protected class. <br>Every year of my life since I was six years old I&#39;ve encountered at least two new female faces who would tell me of their own volition that they had this problem."
mhG-twzaE_g,lucky<br><br>i never outgrew mine and likely never will
mhG-twzaE_g,"Well Alan to be fair a lot of people in the comments are just pointing out that Freud was a pretty crazy guy. In my native language his works would be called a Hagelsvar or &quot;Shotgun-answer&quot;. He didn&#39;t really know what he was doing so he just guessed. Some guesses were right, a lot were wrong. Copious amounts of cocaine, probably a pretty rough childhood in Austria-Hungary, a few mental issues and boom! You have a madman! (Or Sigmund Freud to be more precise.) With some work his theories are perfectly viable but taking it straight from Freud himself would be like asking the local drunk to solve the climate crisis."
mhG-twzaE_g,@Cabeza Depija  well that&#39;s true

mhG-twzaE_g,@jacknap1 Marshall I can tell from Freud’s theory that you shat your pants at age 2
mhG-twzaE_g,He did not believe this. He viewed it as a pathology that should be grown out of.
mhG-twzaE_g,@Emily Rencken lmao it’s the same shit just backwards.
mhG-twzaE_g,"@Ŧħɨs ᵾsɇɍ actually, SHOULD have."
mhG-twzaE_g,"@Ŧħɨs ᵾsɇɍ ha even non-religious people wouldn&#39;t know who came first. Because evolution can&#39;t show that. Just another thing that makes more sense about a creator. If evolution was true, who came first and why do our reproductive systems fit perfectly like a puzzle piece? We need eachother and could have just evolved as one species/gender."
mhG-twzaE_g,"Well, they were theories from more than 100 years ago, what did you expected? <br>If you just stuck to what comes in the video and don’t read more in depth it will really come off as something insane<br>But his theories really helped the bases of the psychoanalysis and, in general, psychotherapy nowadays and as time went by and more authors, theories and contributions came out it helped and improved psychoanalysis<br>Yes, Freud had a lot of issues regarding colleagues that didn’t followed what he said or just other authors interested in psychoanalysis that didn’t agreed with what he said and, in general, he was a questionable person<br>But well, It’s not like his theories are followed by the book and by this I mean that it is suuuuuper rare that people nowadays follow and apply his orthodox psychoanalysis"
mhG-twzaE_g,@Well Prepared Cat No I mean that some facts in his theory are correct

mhG-twzaE_g,The rich like to spend lots of money on weird stuff
mhG-twzaE_g,@Julia Lia who was talking about all our behavior?
mhG-twzaE_g,lol
mhG-twzaE_g,@Julia Lia Definitely
mhG-twzaE_g,@Daniel RTSC not all behavior.

mhG-twzaE_g,"@Kati West oh! I&#39;m sorry for you...<br>I don&#39;t know, I always had a strange logic, so maybe it protected me, are you doing ok now?"
mhG-twzaE_g,"@Kati West sorry, I didn&#39;t answer one question..<br>About the money, I spend nearly nothing<br>More now in the quarantine, after I hated to go out, now.. well... :)<br>(But maybe I&#39;m so &quot;protective&quot; with my money because all of my family is like that.. but.. yeah dunno)<br>And you? Are you alright now?"
mhG-twzaE_g,@Alguém Aleatório I&#39;m glad you learned a good lesson from it! I hope if I had been a bit older I would have figured that out 😅 for me it was a time where I couldn&#39;t really communicate or reason yet so it was just like &quot;oh I can&#39;t have anything ever! Got it!&quot;
mhG-twzaE_g,"@Kati West dunno, I just kinda of stabilized myself pretty quickly, I didn&#39;t find it a trauma, I got it as thing like, &quot;oh ok, maybe next time&quot; <br>But this was good for me, because of that I learned that the logic that &quot;if it is expensive is good&quot; not always works, an that was not necessary always pick the expensive, even more when it comes to popsicles.<br> So i developed as a kid with a lot of empathy, nothing serious at all."
mhG-twzaE_g,"Well what&#39;s your relationship with money now? I took being told &quot;we can&#39;t afford that&quot; one time as a trauma (because 2 year old brains are not super complex) and decided I was never going to ask for anything ever. Caused some problems because I was practicing chronic self-denial my entire childhood/early adulthood. If you wanna draw parallels to this theory it lined up with the anal phase, refusing to do things that feel good (like taking a satisfying dump lol).<br>Something they didn&#39;t cover is if you&#39;re stunted in one phase you might not ever move on to the next one? I forgot exactly how that works"
mhG-twzaE_g,@Aiden Moody Abuse is wrong.
mhG-twzaE_g,Attention ⚠️ You people call him mad and theories crazy because of moral values taught by your parents/society.
mhG-twzaE_g,No-
mhG-twzaE_g,@Dr. Man i do
mhG-twzaE_g,@Son D. Lollipop How tho XD I just pointed it out
mhG-twzaE_g,Hahahaha!!!!
mhG-twzaE_g,tbh this video would’ve been very long if they had to explain why in every situation. most of it links back to his theory of the unconscious mind and the way that framework comes into our everyday actions. it all makes sense according to his theory but perhaps lacks external validity in regards to other theories.
mhG-twzaE_g,"Science has more rules now but since then people have studied this quite a bit (I have no idea the results, Freud is a huge point of contention in academia)"
mhG-twzaE_g,Wretched Excess I&#39;M PHOTOSYNTHESIZINGGGGG

mhG-twzaE_g,"@Jakob Moscow He&#39;s asking because he&#39;s a racist, I&#39;ve noticed that most hardcore Freud fanboys are."
mhG-twzaE_g,"@Memero Culero I am 1/8th Jewish, but, I am curious, why exactly are you asking? lol"
mhG-twzaE_g,@Jakob Moscow <br>Are you a Jew?
mhG-twzaE_g,Amazing u attack Freud using one of his own concepts! lol.
mhG-twzaE_g,"@Nunya Biz Damn he got dissed, he must be wrong"
mhG-twzaE_g,Ok
mhG-twzaE_g,So basically God is dead and we have killed him
mhG-twzaE_g,Crack good 4 you
mhG-twzaE_g,@QuiteBzr psychology is technically a science tho I understand some don&#39;t believe that...it does have strong roots in biology but also depends on socialisation too!
mhG-twzaE_g,I wouldn&#39;t exactly call him a scientist but ok
mhG-twzaE_g,He was on coke
mhG-twzaE_g,"Well, yes actually"
mhG-twzaE_g,@CriminalChicken so it was like paracetamol and 100 years in the future we will be saying &quot;are you high? This guy gave paracetamol to cure addictions😂😂😂😂😂😂&quot;<br>After we start over dosing on paracetamol🤗
mhG-twzaE_g,I mean technically that&#39;s not wrong
mhG-twzaE_g,U wont be an addict if u are dead
mhG-twzaE_g,"Ah yes, accelerationist medicine: overdosing the patient, that way they will never feed the addiction again"
mhG-twzaE_g,"@Name? well I don&#39;t know why you&#39;re over thinking a YouTube comment and stating what is self explanatory. But Freud&#39;s work is only talked about for historical purposes. Next to none of it is still taken seriously. Don&#39;t form your opinions from a YouTube comments section, do your own research."
mhG-twzaE_g,Working on it :)
mhG-twzaE_g,But apparently we understand enough to say that humans are just machines with emotions... got it
mhG-twzaE_g,"This may be due to the fact that scientists have not understood entirely the way our minds work. There are millions of neurons in our brains, each one somehow connected to others, and we&#39;re not sure yet how it affects us. We think we control most of the things we do but in reality our decisions are mostly subconscious. Of course, it might be simpler, maybe because we are social animals, we can&#39;t live without others etc, so other people have the most influencing role on our life and psychology."
mhG-twzaE_g,I&#39;m doing psychology at A level and I noticed this as well. Most of it is really deterministic towards our mental state and the free will approaches aren&#39;t taken as seriously.
mhG-twzaE_g,Wut...
mhG-twzaE_g,Always the cass
mhG-twzaE_g,@wilbert What&#39;s &quot;those&quot;?  LOL
mhG-twzaE_g,@Ryan Blanche &quot;Oh! so thats what those are&quot;
mhG-twzaE_g,LOL<br>You read a sex magazine at that age?
mhG-twzaE_g,we&#39;ll probably never know....
mhG-twzaE_g,@vicious zero I agree.

mhG-twzaE_g,"Wait, what’s my psychology then?"
mhG-twzaE_g,@ShadowPhoenix82 Um is your brain considered part of your body? If so then that is where your consciousness or conscientious lives.
mhG-twzaE_g,@Nicholas Christiaan Scheckter is it really even a study of a part of our bodies?  Is the conciousness a part of our body?
mhG-twzaE_g,"“Wait, it’s all sex?”<br><br>“Always has been.”"
mhG-twzaE_g,"I mean, every species main goal is to reproduce right?"
mhG-twzaE_g,"Ya, that’s a bunch of bs"
mhG-twzaE_g,"While a lot of Freud&#39;s stuff is odd, there is some truth to be found in the idea that our childhoods can affect us."
mhG-twzaE_g,Bruhhh he mentioned the latency. Which means you still can learn a lot while growing up. You didn&#39;t understand the video at all.
mhG-twzaE_g,"It is not bullshit. There are many studies about how our childhood affects us. And it does. Also Freud did not talk about us being prisoners of it. Those problems don’t have to occur, it’s mainly about tendencies. I can’t understand why no one really gets it"
mhG-twzaE_g,"Yep, illusionZ XD Freud had some pretty strong statements :D"

mhG-twzaE_g,"Not even close. Freud was a typical man of that era, full of himself"
mhG-twzaE_g,U mad?
mhG-twzaE_g,"This isn&#39;t factual, its a theory that has been proven false again and again."
mhG-twzaE_g,(I&#39;m an adult btw. I forgot to clarify that.)
mhG-twzaE_g,"There&#39;s plenty of high-school-level textbooks on the matter that you can study at your own pace, if you&#39;re interested. Keep in mind that this is just a theory and have fun learning."
mhG-twzaE_g,"I wouldn&#39;t consider this science, but philosophy at most."
mhG-twzaE_g,"Hi Madhumanti Mandal, great suggestion!"
mhG-twzaE_g,"From what little I know, I&#39;ve got the impression that a rigorous scientific method still hasn&#39;t been developed for psychology. Theories may still be interesting for tickling the minds of us non-professionals and possibly even help for therapy, however."
mhG-twzaE_g,It&#39;s more like leaving home! not throwing father out.
mhG-twzaE_g,Attention ⚠️ You people call him mad and theories crazy because of moral values taught by your parents/society.
mhG-twzaE_g,I mean me and him would just attack each other with puns. It was terrible
mhG-twzaE_g,"I never had that sort of rivalry with either of my parents, but instead had it with other people when I felt that they were getting more attention from my parents than me. Wonder why."

mhG-twzaE_g,"@ledocteur7 I knew other animals were intelligent but wow, that’s cool. I guess Humans are not as far ahead of the rest as I thought."
mhG-twzaE_g,"@Anomalocaris Lover not only human, but a lot of relatively &quot;complex&quot; mammal such has most species of monkey, penguin and some other cases has been proven capable of expressing homosexuality quite commonly and even other sexuality in rarer cases, so yeah, gene passing isn&#39;t everything at all."
mhG-twzaE_g,I mean I kind of understand to an extent. Life in general is based on organisms wanting to pass genes on. But humans are more complex and I don’t fully agree that human condition is based on sex.
mhG-twzaE_g,"He’s not completely wrong. We’re animals. Highly evolved and intelligent animals, but animals."
mhG-twzaE_g,"Yeaaaah,it&#39;s alll coming togetherrrr...."
mhG-twzaE_g,"But that&#39;s just a theory, a PEEN THEORY"

mhG-twzaE_g,"Oops, wrong channel!"
mhG-twzaE_g,@itsmeyaboi I knew several girls when I was growing up who had penis envy and readily admitted to it. Way before they ever even heard of some guy named Freud.
mhG-twzaE_g,"Sea Raider more amused than angry about this, but claiming women feel inferior because they don’t have a penis is laughable lmaoo. I’m a woman and as a child I never felt jealous of boys because they had a penis. I’m wondering what his theory of the phallic phase was based off of, because it seems like Freud severely misinterpreted/misread some things."
mhG-twzaE_g,@Sea Raider because Freud was a freak
mhG-twzaE_g,@Deados Cheetos I’m ace too and I can confirm
mhG-twzaE_g,Thank God everyone can change. Just because you were unlucky with your parents doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t change as a person.
mhG-twzaE_g,@Fatal Errored Kassie . Ace people dont neccesarily feel disgusted by their private parts although some are some just accept it but doesnt focus on it (Speaking as an ace person)
mhG-twzaE_g,"@Soda_Pressed depends on the perversion. Secretly watching strangers undress? Horrible, no arguments. Having your consenting significant other wear a collar and dog ears? Still considered being a pervert, but isn&#39;t harmful and is over all okay."
mhG-twzaE_g,@Kadeem Johnson ?
mhG-twzaE_g,LMAO 🤣🤣🤣
mhG-twzaE_g,@Brendonian yeah he&#39;s an interesting person from the looks of it
mhG-twzaE_g,"@brainman67 Possibly. Freud was messed up in quite a few ways, so I wouldn’t exactly be surprised if that contributed to it"
mhG-twzaE_g,@Brendonian anger towards his mother?
mhG-twzaE_g,Good point! I&#39;m pretty sure we actually don&#39;t know how to raise a healthy woman in Western culture
mhG-twzaE_g,"Oh, they didn&#39;t show a strong female because Freud didn&#39;t believe in strong women. From what I know, Freud believed in the strong man (Hans), the weak man (Ernst), and the weak woman (Eda). It wasn&#39;t the fault of the channel, it was the fault of Freud."
mhG-twzaE_g,@Cardinality of a set the number is increasing because our population is increasing. Am I wrong?

mhG-twzaE_g,"@Leonardo Teles Most of the time you won&#39;t be able to find corelations between treatment and recovery because each person is different and has different reactions to medication. Up to date science simply can&#39;t deal with all the variables in the brain. Btw I&#39;ve never said that it can&#39;t help people. I just believe that psychology stands on wrong axioms and has to be reformed. Nowadays, more than 300 million people (possibly even more) suffer from some common mental disorder and the number is increasing. Modern psychology seems to fail to cure poeple consistently at the moment."
mhG-twzaE_g,"bro stop spreding things like that, go read and undertand fully, you are being ignorant, psycology helps people, and people like you guys in internet are just being ignorant and helping to make something good that helps people, looks bad"
mhG-twzaE_g,Preco chodis nahy do skoly?
mhG-twzaE_g,"YES. This is just a probability guide, and shouldn&#39;t be taken 100% seriously."
mhG-twzaE_g,"Yeah, logically, but this video is just presenting Freud&#39;s theory how it is. Keep in mind Freud is the father of psychoanalysis: before him, little to no research. So of course his vision is gonna be simplistic, outdated and backwards. Yet it still is the basis of later research and it definitely contributed a lot back in its time. We all know Freud&#39;s theory is not accurate and overly simplistic, doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s any less historically relevant."
mhG-twzaE_g,What about it
mhG-twzaE_g,"Hi Hisham Ahammad, thanks for the suggestion!"
mhG-twzaE_g,Fax
mhG-twzaE_g,"@Mohammed Mesum Hussain it’s about how he got a firm grasp on the idea and understanding of how it affects majority of things we do....without the base for that, the other theories of other researchers wouldn’t have anything to build off of to create diagnosis and treatments for other problems....like ptsd, sociopath etc"
mhG-twzaE_g,"@Zay Atkinson what&#39;s so big deal about subconscious mind? Isn&#39;t it obvious that we have it. I mean atleast I was able to observe that there are certain tasks which became automated after I learnt them putting some effort, at a very young age..... I didn&#39;t knew it was called the subconscious mind..... I was probably 8 year old at that time (even an 8 year old can figure that thing out).<br><br>Even if it is not obvious, and he was really a genius to come up with the theory of subconscious mind, all that still doesn&#39;t imply this theory of his is right. Even great thinkers do mistakes sometimes..... only criticism can develop a field. Blind faith won&#39;t cut it."
mhG-twzaE_g,"@Juandre Ferreira his theories helping people all over the world as of now still doesn&#39;t imply him being right. you can still be wrong after being right for hundreds of thousand times. I don&#39;t know much about psychoanalysis and heard of this guy for the first time. But I can say one thing, this theory can&#39;t be right..... it&#39;s more like pseudo-science."

mhG-twzaE_g,@Enitsu I can imagine that thanks
mhG-twzaE_g,@Asya envying another genital when u dont have one is most likely gender dysphoria and most of the time ppl who have gender dysphoria is under the trans umbrella
mhG-twzaE_g,"@IntendedChaos imagine caring abt who ppl date like what is it gonna do to u. &quot;OH NO! A GAY IS KISSING, OH WHAT SHALL I DO.&quot; Is that how u act, u wouldn&#39;t like that to straight ppl would ya"
mhG-twzaE_g,@IntendedChaos can definitely imagine. it&#39;s such a very good thought honestly
mhG-twzaE_g,More than likely your parents or family did something to trigger it happening before it was supposed to.
mhG-twzaE_g,Same
mhG-twzaE_g,"@Michelle Sanborn thank you very much for your answer, I dont actually believe in reincarnation, but I believe in God, and I think that dreams are so important, they are not just seen randomly, they have meanings and explanations. Thank you I&#39;ll do a closer research about healing with dreams."
mhG-twzaE_g,"Yes, you absolutely can. Through therapy and also his “Interpretation of Dreams” dreams are not junk, they come from the unconscious that can store every single memory, even past lives if you believe in reincarnation. Dreams can heal your soul and psyche, if you want to change behaviors start trying to pay attention to dreams, analyze them, try lucid dreaming, astral projection etc. Now they say the astral world will display your unconscious, the things you would never see while conscious or pre-conscious. Not many people want to change unfortunately or do not see a problem with what they are doing. That’s why therapy and psychology exists. 😃"

mhG-twzaE_g,"Also, a lot of what is said in video like the penis envy thing is also a misconception.<br>What actually happens is the fact that the little man and the little girl start to see the differences between their bodies. One has a penis and the other doesnt. This comes at the same time as the infantile sexual theories. The boy and the girl start to think about their physical diferences and make theories of their own trying to explain these diferences. So what happens the most is that the little boy thinks the girl has either lost her penis or that it will grow up eventually. And the little girl thinks she has lost her penis, so she feels uncomplete physically so she develops a &quot;penis envy&quot; that is translatable to the feeling of being complete. While the boy starts to feel anxious about loosing his penis and being uncomplete like the little girl. This anxiety of wanting to feel complete or fearing to be uncomplete is what starts the oedipus complex.<br>ITS NOT AN ACTUAL PENIS ENVY literaly speaking.<br>And so on.. Theres a lot of misconceptions. What is important is that people need to understand this kind of knowledge comes from clinical observation and has nothing to do with personal beliefs."

mhG-twzaE_g,"I still don’t have a father, but I don’t hold any traumas about it. Then again I guess you miss more something that you once had rather than something you never had. I don’t feel any pain because I was never promised a father figure. But for people with divorced or missing parents, I guess that security was taken from them. Breaking that promise, but that’s just a theory."
mhG-twzaE_g,You must&#39;ve had good people or at least role models in your life. 😊
mhG-twzaE_g,@Demeter greek yes
mhG-twzaE_g,@L A hmmmm 🤔 I tend to disagree that it&#39;s human nature to want to reproduce. I believe though it&#39;s a mere feeling that makes things tend to want to reproduce no matter how intelligent a species is. If it&#39;s something beneficial (a jolly feeling or dopamine per say) that doesn&#39;t hurt you wouldn&#39;t you want more of it? It&#39;s only natural eh?
mhG-twzaE_g,"Sex is a human nature thing. He speaks on it on a psychological level. As absurd and unorthodox as it may seem, it’s still a part of us and our development. When you view it on a more mature perception."

mhG-twzaE_g,@ThatFanBoyGuy there&#39;s a reason why Freud rhymes with &quot;fraud&quot;.

mhG-twzaE_g,OMG YOU&#39;RE RIGHT
mhG-twzaE_g,MarioSnz • lmao
mhG-twzaE_g,"I think my favorite thing about being a girl is that I don’t have a penis 😂<br><br>I once read this article about the whole “penis envy” thing and it opened my mind into interpreting it in a different way. The article says that that “penis envy” we women have isn’t literally a penis envy (as in physically wanting a penis), but more of a “social” penis envy (envying the way men are treated in society where they’re given more dominant roles compared to women) which, as a woman that has lived her whole life in the Middle East, kind of agree with. This envy isn’t natural, it’s how we came up to wildly separate the two genders (there isn’t a physical obstacle that stops women from getting “dominant” jobs in society (like CEO, Surgeon, Judge, Lawyer, etc...) and even some women are as physically capable as men in physically demanding jobs (even thought it’s not very accepted socially))<br><br>There’s an opposing theory that is called the “uterus envy” which is, as stated before, opposed to the “penis envy” and it believes that this whole men-repressing-women thing comes from a man’s insecurity because he isn’t physically able to give life, so that’s why he tries to control the people who do.<br><br>These things are fun to look up, but I never dive too deep in them so I won’t go crazy lol<br><br>Also I do believe that Freud had a very messy childhood and bad relationship with his mother, which shaped a lot of his theories"
mhG-twzaE_g,"I&#39;m not quite certain but my perspective on it is not as much focused on the genital aspect of the terminology but the psychological part, envy. Perhaps misconstrued but the envy of which women desire what they associate as men naturally developing that they don&#39;t that gives them something like power which can be repulsive or attractive (an interesting idea whej it comes to the amount of women that at polar opposites in regards to men) and actually derived from the testes but the phallice having greater sexual importance to the female or society in general."
mhG-twzaE_g,"Lol, love your context detailing 😅 hmmm I do remember thinking as a young kid that boys in general had it easier in life but to be honest it could also be my child mind trying to comprehend the patriarchy we live in 🤷🏻‍♀️ then I grew up and decided being a girl was way more fun 🙃  now I actually dont give so much thought to it tbh."
mhG-twzaE_g,Thank you 🙌
mhG-twzaE_g,"I believe you, but do you know where in the video it was said?"
mhG-twzaE_g,"Hi Simone, this seems to be what Freud believed. He lived around 150 years ago. We try to represent his theory the way his theory was, and not how we would like his theory to have been."
mhG-twzaE_g,Happy we could help ;)
mhG-twzaE_g,Thanks!
mhG-twzaE_g,I feel like I can agree
mhG-twzaE_g,nice name though
mhG-twzaE_g,You had psychology class in high school?
mhG-twzaE_g,@D Caspar taught* or at least at mine they quit doing it a few years ago
mhG-twzaE_g,This is a funny misplaced modifier. It sounds like your high school teacher thought you this in 9 minutes
mhG-twzaE_g,Hahaha!
mhG-twzaE_g,our childhood defines us by teaching us how to function or act to other people based on how our family taught us/ our own experiences. all this sex stuff doesnt apply
mhG-twzaE_g,"Do you have children? Have you raised them? He was a critic of his own theories, we adjust scientific theories all the times to fit what we need. You will see this in children a lot. They need these 5 phases to be a well balanced human contributing to society."
mhG-twzaE_g,That&#39;s why Freud&#39;s psychosexual development theory is basically regarded as obsolete in academic circles. His work in the unconscious is truly commendable though. But I still wonder where Freud would see himself in the spectrum of deviancy from normal as he was also infamous for lying about curing many of his patients.
mhG-twzaE_g,"Well, some things I feel that are linked, like a &quot;domino effect&quot; or chain reaction. Same as you though, I question some of the points that he established (for example, I remember being always happy when my parents were together and wanted to be with my father as much as possible, rather than wanting my mother for my own, Lol. I didn&#39;t understand it when they danced instead of being with me though), but in general I think that it&#39;s hella interesting all this concept.<br><br>Also, despite being very controversial, Freud is pioneer in today&#39;s psychology. There are people who take his concepts and tweak it a bit so they can fit with a scientific background and general understanding..."
mhG-twzaE_g,"@g b <br><br>The ultimate truth is there are variables , no one Theory fits all.<br>  Humans come in all shape , sizes and colors, only basically the same.<br>    The human mind is even more complicated. Such as if you leave GOD out of the equation something needs to fill that void and western man turns to science and it&#39;s theorys<br>But evolution. Don&#39;t sell well to a true Christian, who wants cold hard facts.<br>   You see , &quot;FREE LOVE &quot; is not acceptable as a Christian value.<br>But it is to secularist who are pushing these theories.<br>Therefore something is missing that don&#39;t quite explain human sexual development, as sex addiction or<br>Homosexuality from a Christian understanding can not be understood as normal development.<br>     Casual observation will tell you there is only male and female , only willful ignorance would tell you different.<br>    But gender identity is something quite apart from sexual development , my point is the hard sexual wiring of male and female may well be biological , however I believe gender identity to be spiritual and therefore subject to spiritual forces quite apart form biological forces .<br>   250 pound man , hairy body deep voice , yet puts on a woman&#39;s dress and make up , this I can&#39;t put down to any biological Force and it don&#39;t compute with Freud Theory , to me it is a spiritual/ sexual disease, an<br>Abnormality brought about by. &quot;SIN&quot;<br> But this &quot;SIN&quot; is nothing secularist will take into account , so they say it&#39;s normal .<br>   Spiritual gender mutilation is not normal. One theory don&#39;t cover it all."
mhG-twzaE_g,"@Tom Dooley You do understand that there is no simple fact of this topic and it is being constrantly argued today, therefore a &#39;theory&#39; will be the best argument humans have for that topic."
mhG-twzaE_g,@g b <br><br>   Do you know the difference between Theory and fact ? <br> Most  scientific tipes. Only know<br>Theorys as they will not acknowledge an ultimate truth.
mhG-twzaE_g,Yes if you feelt guilty as well as your parents or caregivers didnt handle the situation well. Maybbe you&#39;d not become a doctor
mhG-twzaE_g,"@Display Chicken never wanna be, seems like &quot;salty&quot; two meanings still got messed up even after I bolding it out with piss and confused people that the comment was suppose to be a joke and never intended to offend people...."
mhG-twzaE_g,bit of a generalization. noting in social science is perfect. until we as a society find the hardcore connection between neurology and psychology will we be able to get more foundational meaning from fields of psychology into a realm of physical proof.
mhG-twzaE_g,@Sprouts I see. Thank you for the precision! Keep up the good work :)
mhG-twzaE_g,"Hi Nox DeadlyPatate, thank you for the great feedback! Yes, not all of Freuds theories are scientific and many of his assumptions are outdated today. But culturally and also in regards to the history of psychology it is hard to imagine a world without his revolutionary theories. I believe his greatest achievements are the acknowledgement of the unconscious and it&#39;s influence on us, the contradicting forces of our personality, which he calls ID, Superego and Ego, and that he created a jargon to talk about sexuality, in general."

mhG-twzaE_g,This is possibly the most thoughtful criticism of Freud I&#39;ve read. <br>Most people just parrot some barely true factoids that they&#39;ve heard.
mhG-twzaE_g,"Simple?<br>Yes, that is the crux of life.<br>We over complicate what we perceive so that we can feel good about how smart we are when we figure out the convoluted paths we create.  <br><br>Most everything boils down to simply one thing.<br><br>Sex/Money/Power, are all about that same thing...<br>...the desire for control; which is an illusion.<br>There is only cause and effect and random chance.<br> Both, guided by the choices we make...<br>...some blindly and others consciously. <br><br>The only real control any of us have are the choices we make or don&#39;t make.<br>Everything else is attempted manipulation.<br><br>&quot;Everybody wants to rule the world.&quot;<br><br>Life is only complicated when you make it so.<br><br>We are all just biological pattern recognition devices, looking for patterns to navigate by. <br><br>I think the nurses and orderlies are about to find my hiding place and they&#39;ll be wanting me to take my medication so, TTFN."
mhG-twzaE_g,what about me where I just find everything hot on a woman
mhG-twzaE_g,"@Nicholas Christiaan Scheckter If it was reductionist and if the theory tends to blanket certain groups of people then we would be talking about sociology and social studies and not psychology. Have you ever read Piaget ? Not even psychoanalysis but pure constructivism. It doesnt matter if you are born in mars or NYC, your intelligence WILL developp following certain steps under a certain logic ALWAYS. What boils me is the fact that people take these videos way to seriously. This video is reductionist and is wrong about the topics it tries to explain because its clear the maker doesnt know nothing about psychoanalysis neither. But again man trying to say psychoanalytic theory is reductionist only shows how little you know about psychoanalysis. Specially when psychoanalisys is literally the best method we have today when it comes to treatment and understanding of the human psyche and also psychopathology. Its perfect ? Absolute NO but no other method is, doesnt matter, we are talking science here not religion.<br>But hey, of you really dislike the approach and you hate it. Fist of all you start by actually reading psychoanaliysis and then you critisize the theory, your arguments will not be &quot;its reductionist&quot; I promise, theres a lot of stuff that can be questioned. But the stages of psycho affective development for being too &quot;reductionist&quot;... I dont think you know really what you&#39;re talking about. <br>Go check your local library its all 50% psycho neurology and other 50% psycho dynamic/analytic studies. We havent found better ways to understand psyche yet and I doubt someone will come up with a better way any soon. Cheers man, happy new year."
mhG-twzaE_g,"@Lucas Mitchell Yeah, I don&#39;t get what&#39;s the problem with these people, I actually find most of what was stated in this theory to be logical or make sense when you really think about it..."
mhG-twzaE_g,"@Doriasta : Basically the only thing people seem to care about nowadays it&#39;s &quot;Does X thing makes you gay&quot; of things like gender studies.<br><br>He actually nailed the Id, ego, and superego thing, and hit quite close to the mark with most of his other theories. Funnily enough, modern psychology would probably no be a thing if it wasn&#39;t for him."
mhG-twzaE_g,Floyd Hebert I m not native in English so maybe I didn’t  get you right  but... what do we talk about in modern psychology then ?

mhG-twzaE_g,"Maybe it&#39;s no really &quot;penis&quot; envy... maybe is only a &quot; I&#39;m considered like an entire person and you are born to be a slave, because I have a penis and you don&#39;t&quot; envy. So, it must be called &quot;sense of justice&quot;, not &quot;envy&quot; of nothing. This theory takes sexism as a nature law that women must accept... so, if you don&#39;t accept sexism, you have a &quot;psychological problem&quot;, because you haven&#39;t &quot;overcome&quot; your &quot;penis envy&quot;."
mhG-twzaE_g,@Robin Arnold when a woman gets mature she transform her envines into admiration. because a good father/mother role in her life.<br>When they haven&#39;t is very difficult for them in this society where it feeds their envines and dirt for attention to cover it.

mhG-twzaE_g,"@Rulos Magicos That&#39;s ever said in the video, which states that all women have this &quot;penis envy&quot;. Which is stupid."
mhG-twzaE_g,YES IT IS AN ISSUE AS A RESULT OF HAVING A BAD FATHER ROLE IN YOUR LIFE AS MODEL.
mhG-twzaE_g,"@R P Actually no! These theories are heavily disproven, a detail they missed in the video."
mhG-twzaE_g,"Thank you, Yalilee!"
mhG-twzaE_g,"Well, that makes sense if you ask me..."
mhG-twzaE_g,... And is that not true?
mhG-twzaE_g,@Angelica Vargas yea Freud is just one guy and some people out here acting like he&#39;s a prophet.  Now he did contribute to the whole lie on the couch and talk about your problems thing. So Freud was important but also NUTS
mhG-twzaE_g,@Angelica Vargas honestly
mhG-twzaE_g,Yeah...It’s a theory. Doesn’t necessarily mean it’s right. People just can’t think for themselves 🤣
mhG-twzaE_g,Oh my gosh I was thinking that too
WMv8A9qg6jY,"It helps the general public, as well as practitioners, to learn the appropriate needs and expectations that are generally required for each stage of a person&#39;s development/age. For example: in Erikson&#39;s Psychosocial model, if a child is in Autonomy vs Shame, then we can expect them to say &quot;no&quot; more often, and want to do things themselves (for ex: wanting to put on their own shoes). A lot of 2 year olds are in this stage, and so it&#39;s important to give them some independence and freedom when they&#39;re in this stage so they develop a healthy sense of autonomy, rather than shame.<br><br>These theories are kind of like a scaffold where it can inform practitioners on the overall wellbeing of the child, and where they may need some extra support."
WMv8A9qg6jY,@Shan x tubercolosiis
WMv8A9qg6jY,How?
WMv8A9qg6jY,"Here is all of the CC text in case you&#39;d like:<br><br><br>Voiceover: Okay so you&#39;re probably looking at this screen and wondering who<br><br>in the world are these four men that I have put on on the screen.<br> <br> Well these four men we&#39;re gonna look at. <br> <br>At are very important in understanding theories of development.<br> <br> So that&#39;s what we&#39;re gonna talk about in this, <br> <br>in this video are the different theories of development.<br> <br> And it would be nice if I could spell it properly. <br> (laughs) There we go. <br> Okay. <br> So, up here, we have Freud. <br> Over here, we have Erikson. <br> Over here is Vygotsky. <br> And last, we have Kohlberg. <br> So, development. <br> Let&#39;s start off by defining what it is. <br> Development is the series of age related changes <br> that happen over the course of a life span. <br> <br>So people pass through different stages in a specific<br> <br> order and each stage builds on top of another. <br> And we develop capacities through those stages. <br> Built upon the previous stage. <br> <br>So these four men had four different theories of how we develop.<br> <br> <br>And the first we&#39;re going to take a look at is Freud, Sigmund Freud.<br> <br> <br>So, Freud proposed the psychosexual theory of development.<br> <br> So let&#39;s write that down here. <br> So, he was. <br> <br>He was important in starting off the psychosexual theory<br> <br> <br>that describes how personality develops during childhood.<br> <br> That&#39;s also another key term. <br> <br>He looked at how we developed through childhood, and<br> <br> <br>he actually believed that early childhood was the most important.<br> <br> <br>Most important age or period in which most of our personalitie&#39;s developed.<br> <br> <br>He said that most of our personality is established by the age of five.<br> <br> <br>And he says that early experiences play a large role in<br> <br> <br>personality development and that continues to influence behavior later in life.<br> <br> <br>And his theory was built upon five stages, which we&#39;ll get into a little bit later.<br> <br> But, if these five stages are completed <br> successfully, the result is a healthy personality. <br> <br>And certain issues, if they&#39;re not resolved at a certain<br> <br> stage and we move ahead to the next stage, then. <br> Something called fixation can happen. <br> <br>So that&#39;s another key term that we&#39;ll take a look at a little later.<br> <br> So that&#39;s the psychosexual theory of Freud. <br> Now the second key player. <br> <br>Or key person that we&#39;re gonna look at was Kohlberg.<br> <br> Sorry not Kohlberg, Erikson. <br> <br>And Erikson talked about the psychosocial development theory.<br> <br> <br>So in this theory, he proposed, Eric Erikson proposed.<br> <br> <br>That personality development occurs through one&#39;s entire lifespan.<br> <br> <br>So, you can already see how it&#39;s a little different<br> <br> <br>from Freud who said personality, most of it&#39;s established in childhood.<br> <br> So he believed that each stage of <br> <br>development again, was focused on overcoming a conflict.<br> <br> <br>And success or failure in dealing with these conflicts<br> <br> <br>at each stage can impact overall functioning of a person.<br> <br> And he proposed a theory that had eight stages, <br> which we&#39;ll take a look at a little later. <br> So in each stage, people faced new challenges and <br> <br>the stages outcome depends on how people handle these challenges.<br> <br> <br>The next person was Lev Vykotsky, who was a Russian theorist.<br> <br> And what Lev said and developed <br> <br>was the sociocultural, cognitive development theory.<br> <br> <br>So, socio-cultural and how it&#39;s heavily influenced by cognitive development.<br> <br> And, what Vygotsky believed was that children <br> learn actively and through hands on experiences. <br> <br>So it&#39;s a very, it&#39;s an active process through which through which we develop.<br> <br> <br>And his sociocultural theory suggests that parents, caregivers, peers<br> <br> <br>cultural beliefs, attitudes, and language are all responsible<br> <br> <br>for the development of this higher order function of learning.<br> <br> And he said that a child internalizes the <br> <br>information they get from the interaction with others.<br> <br> <br>So he was all about, how us as individuals are influenced<br> <br> by those around us and the culture around us. <br> <br>And then that is, that interaction is what is able to<br> <br> <br>guide children in their own performance and in their own development.<br> <br> And his theory stresses this importance of <br> <br>social interaction in the development of cognition.<br> <br> <br>So, fun fact, unfortunately, Vygotzky died at the age of 38.<br> <br> <br>So many of the parts of this theory are actually incomplete.<br> <br> <br>And the last theorist we&#39;re gonna take a look at was Lawrence Kohlberg.<br> <br> And he developed the moral development theory. <br> <br>So he looked at how we develop our morals throughout life.<br> <br> He focused on moral reasoning or why people think <br> <br>about think about the difference between right and wrong.<br> <br> So right versus wrong. <br> He believed that moral reasoning depends. <br> <br>Depends on the level of cognitive development and proposed<br> <br> <br>that people pass through three levels of moral development.<br> <br> So his was three stages, but each of <br> <br>these three stages was further divided into two stages.<br> <br> So altogether, there were six levels. <br> And he came up with this theory after he <br> did a lot of research with groups of children. <br> <br>So he would present these children with a bunch of moral dilemma situations and then<br> <br> after, he would interview the kids to find <br> <br>out their reasoning behind their judgements in each<br> <br> <br>of the scenarios so he could ask them a bunch of questions and try to analyze<br> <br> how they came to certain conclusions and reasoning <br> behind how they solved each of these scenarios. <br> <br>So, overall remember that Freud and Erikson looked at personality.<br> <br> So they were focused on how personality develops. <br> <br>Versus Vygotsky and Kohlberg were interested in how our cognition develops.<br> <br> <br>So their theories were heavily, heavily influenced by cognitive theories.<br> <br> So this is a broad overview of the different <br> <br>stages of development from four main and different perspectives.<br> <br> <br>There are a lot of other and much many more perspectives,<br> <br> but we&#39;re going to focus on these four and so the <br> <br>main takeaway from this is to keep in mind the similarities<br> <br> <br>and differences, as well as the focus of each of the theories.<br> <br> And in the next set of videos, I&#39;ll go <br> into more depth into each one of these theories."

zy3ahUzSanA,My daughter too but I think bc she has a heavy head it would tip her over lol 😆
zy3ahUzSanA,Thank you so much for this!!! I so appreciate you! 🙏🏾🤍
zy3ahUzSanA,"My mother ran a day care and I have my EEC (infant toddler teacher) I have 3 kids, almost 16 yr old, 14 and almost 11yr old. My youngsr was almost 5 weeks early, developmentally you go their full term due date. <br>With my oldest we followed all the &quot;rules&quot; I remember thinking no co sleeping ect.   She had a clockwork  schedule/nap/play/bed time ect.  When my son was born I remember accidently falling asleep one night in my bed while laying sideways breastfeeding him. I woke up to him trying to eat again. We broke a few rules with him and with my youngest, we lost them. Lol  I don&#39;t think she slept in her crib until she was 3 months old, I don&#39;t even remember if we did &quot;tummy time&quot; but she was crawling at 25 weeks. I loved every minute of it. <br>When I think back I so wish I just threw the dang rules out the window with my first. I see all these videos with parents trying to get their baby to walk as early as possible and all I can think is WHY? They will walk (unless of course there&#39;s a medical reason) My ex husband mentioned driver&#39;s Ed today and I thought &quot;What happened and how did we get here so fast&quot; <br>My point try not to compare and just enjoy your newborn.  <br>When I worked I would have one extreme to the next but they all (except again if for  a medical reason) they all caught up to each other by   1/1.5 yrs old. <br>Now I have to wait for grandchildren. Lol."
zy3ahUzSanA,Lovevery
zy3ahUzSanA,I have a close friend and her kid was also born 10 weeks early. Look at the milestones for the corrected age. After your kiddo has 12 months the milestones with the corrected age and actual age should align.
zy3ahUzSanA,Hey there! This is considered developmentally appropriate. No need to stop him
zy3ahUzSanA,So?
zy3ahUzSanA,Omg my baby is only 2 months old and 2 months ahead of yours!

zy3ahUzSanA,"@Kwame Oluwasomi I think there ARE effects related to early vaccination: slight developmental delays, asthma and a couple more. Not autism. I had a girl at work with an egg allergy, meaning she can&#39;t receive vaccines. No one else at work was as on the spectrum as her."
zy3ahUzSanA,"@lollsazz My concern is about autism. The science was never settled on it, I know an ex Pharma Lawyer who used to bend reality to swerve lawsuits and I have my own personal experience to compound my paranoia - I’m on the spectrum. My unvaccinated brother isn’t.<br><br>I don’t use ‘paranoia’ lightly. My wife &amp; I have gone the distance - not once did she get a check up, we birthed our son by ourselves... and we’re in shanti Tanzania, where I’ve seen babies get washed in gutters 😱🤣. Nevertheless, the kids are fine (contrary to what a lot of charity adverts taught me). <br><br>I don’t know, maybe I’ll prick a cow - I mean I get vaccine science... I’m just weary of the concoctions on offer."
zy3ahUzSanA,"@Kwame Oluwasomi Actually, 8 vaccines already. I&#39;m all for vaccines, and both me and my husband, who are both well-educated and emotionally all there, are fully vaccinated. I always feel so bad for our small one though, and kinda wish we could wait for a few months - it&#39;s not likely she&#39;d even encounter any of the bacteria yet and her body has so many other things to handle while being so young :/ Tetanus is the only thing babies can catch early in industrialized coundtries, before kindergarden, so I have nothing against parents that wait till their babies are around half a year old to a year old before getting them vaccunated.<br><br>If the question is about autism though, scientists recently found out that tylenol during pregnancy can cause it..."
zy3ahUzSanA,"Same. He&#39;s now 2.5months and its compounding. No vaccine, right?"
zy3ahUzSanA,How are coping with returning to work? I’m stressing about it. I don’t want to leave my baby with a stranger.
zy3ahUzSanA,is your baby 7 month now?

EYbCE1udazw,"I think a similar ideas is relevant for religion too. I recently came across this quote: “To one who has faith, no explanation is necessary. To one without faith, no explanation is possible.”<br><br>― St. Thomas Aquinas. Seems to fit the schema of your theory!"
EYbCE1udazw,@gemma bailey More experience usually creates more wisdom.
EYbCE1udazw,"@Bummo I read a short but interesting article suggesting that brain structure may have a role to play in political divides. it is suggested that more right wing conservative people have larger amygdalae, meaning they have an increased response to fear and are more worrisome of change. its a rather radical explanation as it does therefore suggest a lack of free will, but at the same time it is not clear which comes first; the structure or the views, much like the chicken and the egg. I believe it must be the views that come first, as views change over time, and if brain structure is genetic then family members would have similar political views which is not the case. however I do have a theory that in fact as we get older, our brain structures must change to reveal a more conservative perspective, as many old people are conservative. the link to the article is <a href=""https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/04/110407121337.htm"">https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/04/110407121337.htm</a>"

EYbCE1udazw,"I&#39;ve been wondering if recent political divides go beyond simple &quot;my team vs your team&quot; and people getting stuck in their own social media bubbles.  Yes, being in a media bubble only getting a partial reporting of facts can influence a person&#39;s perspective but I&#39;ve seen people view the same video and come away with completely different views of what happened.<br><br>Similar to the blue and black/white and gold dress, and yanny/laurel sound, perhaps we all experience reality differently to such a degree that we don&#39;t perceive the same facts as actually existing.  Remember how heated debates on those memes got?  This is more significant than just having a different perspective on an event.<br><br>This video seems to hint at that possibility in terms of how memory is stored in recalled.<br><br>Does anyone know of related research of how the brain works that might be related to this?  Is there historic precedence for a society disagreeing so much on what is actually happening?"
EYbCE1udazw,@Sprouts is there a more direct way to support Sprouts financially?  I stopped using Patreon a while back due to fundamental disagreement with the way they implement their policy.

It is wonderful that the community can add more details and insight into the topics we cover! :) With this video we went for a general overview of the Schema theory and as available literature suggests that &quot;Scripts&quot;, as you describe them, are a sub-type of &quot;Schemata&quot; we didn&#39;t get to explore them in further detail, but it&#39;s great we can get to acknowledge them here!<br>Hope this helps."

EYbCE1udazw,"simply put. It is your &quot;will&quot; and &quot;want&quot;. But this also depends on the time of day, your appetite, surroundings, subject, connection, etc."
EYbCE1udazw,it&#39;s not exactly an how-to video but Sprouts has a video about learning with enthusiasm and passion
EYbCE1udazw,@Henry Mourland sometimes extrinsic motivation can be a powerful motivation for doing something that in the beginning you weren&#39;t really self -determined to do and paradoxically end up to become intrinsic motivation.
EYbCE1udazw,This would potentially be about intrinsic vs extrinsic motivation
EYbCE1udazw,"To clarify, are you saying &quot;if you don&#39;t want,&quot; or are you saying &quot;if you can&#39;t?&quot;<br><br>I don&#39;t think an individual who has experienced severe trauma in there life would &quot;want&quot; to make sense of their world based on violence endured. I believe most would agree.<br><br>As a result, their schemata won&#39;t allow for them process their world beyond their instinct to survive. They assimilate acts of kindness with duplicity, etc.<br><br>In other words, please help me to understand your point of view or if you will, point me in the right direction of your research."

EYbCE1udazw,@Sprouts omg hello 🤩🤩🤩😆😆
EYbCE1udazw,Hi Snowman! :)
EDU45WQjd7Y,Thank you
EDU45WQjd7Y,Thanks
EDU45WQjd7Y,Thankyou sir bahut hi achha explain Kiya hai.
EDU45WQjd7Y,@Himachali Youth Adda Bhai dekh rha hu...☺
EDU45WQjd7Y,पूरी विडियो देख लेना SIR😊
G2XBIkHW954,You got great point. I think human evolved and babies can learn from pad and phone these days
G2XBIkHW954,"That&#39;s awesome. Unfortunately, primary school is long after the critical period of language learning mentioned in this video."
G2XBIkHW954,"I think the more you speak, the more she will absorb, and the more sophisticated language you use, the more sophisticated will be her language. I think you also have to be careful not to overwhelm her with too much language (I could be wrong about this)."
G2XBIkHW954,You sound a little angry. You ok?
G2XBIkHW954,You totally ruined this for me by saying that.
G2XBIkHW954,Jarvis Lo She is not talking about associated meaning. She is talking about indentification of the specific sounds a language uses. These are two very different things. The research proved that babies only do their statistical analysis of the sounds and patterns they are hearing when it comes from an actual person. Pay attention.
G2XBIkHW954,"1- Kuhl, p. et al (1997) Cross-Language Analysis of Phonetic Units in Language Addressed to Infants. Science, 277.<br><br><br> 2- Kuhl, P. (2000) A New View of Language Acquisition. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, Vol. 97, No. 22<br><br>Let me know if you need more."
G2XBIkHW954,Yeah and the sad fact of the matter is that most of these polyglots do not sound native even though they claim to. They may be fluent but the sounds they make are noticeably not native. This is at least my observation with people speaking Swedish (my native language). <br><br>Interestingly though the only foreigner that sounded native to me out of the hundreds of polyglots I&#39;ve listened to was my music teacher. I find this interesting as I&#39;ve heard somewhere that speaking and singing are processed in different parts of the brain.
G2XBIkHW954,Thank you. By reading the abstract I finally understood the experiment  carried out on bilingual babies.
G2XBIkHW954,"body has to adapt, to catching the sound then to pronounce it using correct combination of musclework.<br>if you will ever have a child and it will start making weird sounds and be very persistent in making them, even if you will be totally annoyed, never silence them. they&#39;re training."
G2XBIkHW954,"+DownFlex Knowing 4 languages, even fluently, still is not the same as acquiring it. Are you saying you have no accent in the languages you&#39;ve learned? If your pronunciation is EXACTLY like a native speaker, you have a very rare gift.<br>I don&#39;t know a single person who learned a language as an adult and doesn&#39;t have distinct non-native accent."
G2XBIkHW954,@DownFlex just because you know 4  languages doesnt mean that statement is wrong. if u was brought up bilingual you may acquire these languages a lot faster. She didnt demonstrate a common fallacy there she said they have more difficulty not that its really difficult or impossible.
G2XBIkHW954,"@avatarf fullon Thats why I said &quot;translate them to a close counterpart&quot;.I know that you cant translate directly, but well yeah, I have said that!"
G2XBIkHW954,@DownFlex some words are non translatable  eg  dharma in hindi/sanskrit can be described as an intersection of different words but not as a one word in english similarly their will  always be some difference the way you and a native speak
G2XBIkHW954,"Also the big and fundametal difference is that you, as an adult, need to take classes to learn a second language, a child learns his native language without someone teaching him/her."
G2XBIkHW954,"You don&#39;t understand the point, there is a HUGE difference between the competence of a native speaker and the competence of a person who speaks a second language."
G2XBIkHW954,Were you 6-8 months old in grade school? This is talking about very early in development. By the time you were in grade school you lost the ability to take statistics like infants do.
G2XBIkHW954,Id say babies and children are far better at developing a base language. What you learnt is how to translate english into another language. You might do it so fast it doesn&#39;t seem like a translation but it wouldnt be a true internalization of the language like a baby could have. More a logical processing
G2XBIkHW954,"Um...yeah...anyway, it&#39;s called the &#39;Critical Period Hypothesis&#39;. It&#39;s closely related to Noam Chomsky&#39;s theories on Generative Grammar. It has nothing to do with your ability to learn French in high school. Actually, it sort of does a little bit, but I can&#39;t be bothered explaining any further - Yours Truly (undergrad in teaching, master of education, master of applied linguistics)"
G2XBIkHW954,Read Maria Teresa Guasti
G2XBIkHW954,May I download this without going through all the registration?
G2XBIkHW954,+Keeley Tim &quot;Many experts dispute this claim.&quot;<br>Then where are your sources?
G2XBIkHW954,"@Jason Hardin The point still stands that the earlier you learn, the easier it is. The critical period refers to learning the native language or teaching true bilingualism (where both languages are equal in use and comprehension)."
G2XBIkHW954,"The critical period is 0-8 months, I don&#39;t think I want the government getting involved with my child that young.."
G2XBIkHW954,"It&#39;s because of the undercurrent of racism in this country. In order for school systems to teach children another language then it would have to be deemed necessary and beneficial. The american mindset is that english is the only necessary language, that any foreigner should learn english, and that other languages are inferior. Parents would have a fit if their kids were being taught another language. It would also be the parents or the school who would decide what other language the child would be taught, and which language is the right choice? So the idea is that the students choose what language to learn when they are old enough."
G2XBIkHW954,"I totally agree, for example many babies are fluent in sign language due to learning during these early months and years."
G2XBIkHW954,"I highly recommend watching the videos by Matt vs. Japan. I know that this is a little late, but the concepts that he shares are really interesting and might help you out."
G2XBIkHW954,"Oh my gosh! I was wondering if anyone else noticed her mistake! ☺When she said &quot;to you and I,&quot; I slightly cringed in the middle of my brain! Gah! (I enjoyed everything else she stated, though.)"
G2XBIkHW954,"I literally don&#39;t understand what your point is here - Dr. Kaul said so many things meaningful and useful in this short clip, while all you care about is somewhat un-synced soundtrack ? And 105 likes? Seriously, people ?"
G2XBIkHW954,I guess you don´t like ASMR then...
G2XBIkHW954,You mean the corporeal noise which is not part of the speech but is emitted from the face as a result of the movement of the mouth instead of the vocal cord.
G2XBIkHW954,"I agree, so weird."
G2XBIkHW954,"If Ken Robinson spoke right before her, I wouldn&#39;t blame them."
G2XBIkHW954,Did you watch the part where the TV had no effect on the babies learning sounds. It requires an actual human to interact with the baby.  I feel bad for your kids already.
G2XBIkHW954,"so, how did it go ? :)"
G2XBIkHW954,lmao i am 8 years late but when i noticed i laughed so hard for the rest of the video
q1552sXvKNc,Do you mean captions?
q1552sXvKNc,That would be plagiarism my friend.
UA-Tk9qlG9A,Me too 😅
UA-Tk9qlG9A,Same here
UA-Tk9qlG9A,They don&#39;t care.
UA-Tk9qlG9A,"Hi Menita congratulations. I did the same thing when I was pregnant with my baby girl . I  am not sure if I was pregnant at the time but if I  was I didn&#39;t know.  I was really worried about my baby!!! She ended up being fine and healthy 😊 you did not know , and just as long and you do not do it anymore I think everything will be okay .  Drink plenty of water get plenty of rest   .  God  bless u and your baby"
UA-Tk9qlG9A,Same!!
UA-Tk9qlG9A,Wonderful
UA-Tk9qlG9A,100% God have mercy on us all.
UA-Tk9qlG9A,how are you doing right now? 🙌
UA-Tk9qlG9A,wdym
UA-Tk9qlG9A,i hope you and your baby are doing well :(
UA-Tk9qlG9A,what do you mean
UA-Tk9qlG9A,how is your daughter doing?
UA-Tk9qlG9A,what do you mean
UA-Tk9qlG9A,how&#39;s the baby? :D
UA-Tk9qlG9A,@eric yes
UA-Tk9qlG9A,are you trying to conceive?
UA-Tk9qlG9A,"Thank you, Hugo Furst!"
UA-Tk9qlG9A,Just as I was about to announce finding out the same news today!..I see your comment with the same last name as my baby. After thinking I could never have children. Life is so divine.
UA-Tk9qlG9A,Congrats! How is it going? 💙 Annisa
UA-Tk9qlG9A,hope the baby is fine! :)
UA-Tk9qlG9A,"@High Vibrational Woman Great to hear. I think if it&#39;s brownish you should be ok. Sometimes after sex this can happen also. If it&#39;s red go to the ER. Cramping does occur  throughout pregnancy but  and small intervals. I had the same issue they called it a  subchorionic hematoma, which is like a small hemorrhage. I was scared they also called at a threatened miscarry. I am 6 months along now and me and baby are doing fine. A quick call to the doctors don&#39;t hurt to calm your worries. Blessings to you and your baby."
UA-Tk9qlG9A,@Memento Mori I’ve have the ultrasound. I heard the heartbeat and everything. All of this happened before I had the confirmation of being pregnant and seeing everything. I haven’t had a period since October.
UA-Tk9qlG9A,@High Vibrational Woman It could be normal but you should see a doctor to be sure everything is developing ok. You are so early but they may be able to get a sonogram for you.  Typically it&#39;s done at nine weeks.....but .....You could fib and say you are not sure how far along you are or when your last period was but you missed your period this last month maybe the month before and they will do a sono. Blessings to you dear.
UA-Tk9qlG9A,"Cramping, yes. A little. Light cramps, spotting, a little, yes but not often. I spotted once after I was pregnant thinking it was my period but nothing else. I’m about 9 weeks."
UA-Tk9qlG9A,Yes indeed!
UA-Tk9qlG9A,All the best wishes!
UA-Tk9qlG9A,Wishing you to feel better soon!
UA-Tk9qlG9A,Congratulations
UA-Tk9qlG9A,All the best to you!

UA-Tk9qlG9A,@Leslie arevalo thank you so much!!
UA-Tk9qlG9A,It will be great! Good luck 🤗wishing you and your baby a healthy and happy life
UA-Tk9qlG9A,@M K said many but not all. those who say fetuses are not living in the womb are the ones whom I was talking about
UA-Tk9qlG9A,screaming at what? this video has nothing to do with abortion and doesn’t change my mind on being pro-choice
UA-Tk9qlG9A,What is your anxiety mainly about? Wishing you and your baby all the best!
UA-Tk9qlG9A,Good luck and health to both of you!

UA-Tk9qlG9A,"From the very beginning.   You may not think you are being heard, but be patient and persistent.  And, if you expect an answer, you may find yourself learning a lot about the baby before he or she is born."
UA-Tk9qlG9A,"Hi Astrid, we do not always have control over what influences our babies and later, our children. These things that happen in our life are part of our destiny and part of our children&#39;s destiny. And every child responds differently to the challenges that it faces. <br>What is a blessing, is that you are aware of the pain and grief you are going through now,  and in a few years, or maybe even already now, you can talk to your baby/child about those feelings and were they come from. And explain that they are part of life too. I wish you two all the best health and happiness when it is time for it :)"

UA-Tk9qlG9A,Going on walks and breathing fresh air helped me soooooo so much when i had morning sickness and mine lasted all day but it would calm down after going on walks and then i would try to munch on a fruit
UA-Tk9qlG9A,"@Priyankashinde Shinde you get blood work done at 18 weeks. And doctors can identify the gender of the baby at that point by counting the chromosomes in the mother&#39;s bloodstream. If there&#39;s male chromosome floating around, it&#39;s a boy baby. If there&#39;s extra counts of female chromosome it&#39;s a girl baby."

UA-Tk9qlG9A,@I AM FLORENCE I am deeply saddened by your loss.  Please take the time to grieve the death of your baby.  There are resources that may help.  Please consider naming your baby.  Maybe God will reveal to you your baby&#39;s gender and you can name him or her accordingly.  Or there are several gender-neutral names you can choose.  Prayers for your healing.

UA-Tk9qlG9A,"But his behavior as an addict or alcoholic can affect the mother, which will affect the baby.  PLUS the baby knows and perceives more of the outside world than they are given credit, so his behavior can affect the baby.  The best thing is to allow your child to inspire you [or whomever the father is] to become sober for the long-term well-being of not only the baby but for yourself [himself] and your [or the father&#39;s] family."
UA-Tk9qlG9A,I think that’s very unlikely.

UA-Tk9qlG9A,@Matt Bruh uhm yeah .....ohhh actually I live in india and it&#39;s banned her to know gender before birth (because people used to abort baby girls) that&#39;s whyy i was curious
UA-Tk9qlG9A,@Astha Pahwa &quot;do you know her gender&quot;
UA-Tk9qlG9A,How was your birth?
UA-Tk9qlG9A,Don’t stress. It is useless exercise. Past is finished future we don’t know - it is only the present that you have control. So live only in the present.
UA-Tk9qlG9A,"If you want your stress shouldn&#39;t affect ur baby, you only can do that.. I know we can&#39;t overcome our mind, slowly if you try for sometime daily, then u can achieve stressfree mind... Try to divert your mind by doing meditation(in Gyana Mudra, which relax your mind within min, also makes your baby smart&amp;intelligent thought that mudra), yoga nidra, walking meditation and any mantra chanting really calms your mind.. Try &amp; try everyday.. Much love to u &amp; ur baby dear💕 you deserve peaceful &amp; happy life ❤"

Well, some know they want babies and start trying as young as they can.  <br>But if you remotely think about it [and think from a long-term perspective (If I don&#39;t have babies, will I regret not being a grandmother at age 60 or 70 or 80?)], then consider what about it makes you afraid.  If there are issues you can resolve, start working on them to resolve them.  <br>If not, then perhaps consider that since you are afraid, you realize raising children is a big responsibility.  Then recognize and give yourself credit for that realization, and ask God to give you an even stronger love for your children and a strong maternal instinct.  With His help, you will be fine.  Hope this helps."
UA-Tk9qlG9A,"After my first pregnancy ended in miscarriage I knew I was ready. With my first pregnancy I was terrified and wondering if I had made the right choice (I got pregnant on purpose.) But when our baby died I was absolutely devastated. Then it took months and months to fall pregnant again, and ironically I fell pregnant the month I completely gave up because I figured something was wrong with my body. I&#39;ll be 16 weeks pregnant on Saturday and this baby seems to be doing okay so far. I have no regrets or hesitations about this baby like I did with the first. All I want is to be a mom."
UA-Tk9qlG9A,Im 6 months... congratulations to you♥️
UA-Tk9qlG9A,Beautiful!
UA-Tk9qlG9A,Amen I&#39;m sorry
UA-Tk9qlG9A,Thanks! 😊
UA-Tk9qlG9A,You sound like you&#39;ll be an amazing older sibling!
UA-Tk9qlG9A,"best wishes to you, your mom and the baby 👶"
UA-Tk9qlG9A,Hang in there. All it takes is practice. Finding a way to relate to the material or make it fun helps! Imagine the processes as favorite scenes in a cartoon.
UA-Tk9qlG9A,"This is widely recognised within childhood development, and is easily googlable. It sounds like you&#39;ve gone into a defence mechanism instead of intellectualising the message. Not everything &#39;negative&#39; is &#39;shaming&#39;, it&#39;s simply a fact of life."
UA-Tk9qlG9A,I had lot of stress during 2nd month.. really worried..after that COVID stress..:(
UA-Tk9qlG9A,"My little sister was adopted. Her birth mother experienced extreme stress while pregnant (she realized that her toddler was being molested) and while my sister can function in everyday life, she’s aggressive and somewhat violent. The video isn’t talking about everyday stress and besides, stress only increases the chances of something being wrong with your baby. It doesn’t guarantee it."
UA-Tk9qlG9A,its not fear mongering its educating you sounds like youve realized a flaw in your plan lol
UA-Tk9qlG9A,I&#39;m 14 weeks ☺️
UA-Tk9qlG9A,best wishes to you and the baby!
UA-Tk9qlG9A,You should feel bad for the women put into a position that made them feel like abortion was the only choice. Abortion isn&#39;t an easy choice and most people mourn what was lost even when they know they made the right choice for their life. A lot of it comes down to lack of money and/or lack of access to sex ed and birth control. I had a miscarriage with my first pregnancy and it has made abortion a very sensitive topic for me but I&#39;m still not about to shame other women for their own choices either.
UA-Tk9qlG9A,"Some specialists can use microscopic cameras to take images, etc. while the baby is developing and learn from that.  The ethical ones may ask permission from bona-fide pregnancy loss parents, such as ectopic pregnancies, etc. to examine the babies more carefully.  When looking at sources, make sure they specify that NONE of their research was done from aborted babies.<br>Studies done in other countries actually confirm that babies progress and grow faster [i.e. are more developed sooner] than some of the milestones listed in this video."
UA-Tk9qlG9A,@Aish Sachi Amen
UA-Tk9qlG9A,"I pray in the name of Jesus Christ my savior and Lord .<br>Behold, children are a heritage from the LORD, The fruit of the womb is a reward. Psalm 127<br><br>I pray this word over you dear . May Jesus open your womb and give you a child . Trust him and he will bless you .. amen"
UA-Tk9qlG9A,🙏
UA-Tk9qlG9A,"Not necessarily.  From what I learned, it can be genetic and mostly from the mother&#39;s side.  However, if a mom is diagnosed with bipolar, the child may or may not develop bipolar or depression or other mental illness.  A mother&#39;s mental illness does not always pass on to her children.  There are plenty of things that a mom and family can do to increase the mental health, wellness, and stability of their children (for instance, anchoring them in the Prince of Peace, the Messiah, and our one true God).  Focus on those things."
UA-Tk9qlG9A,"Fine then, i shall travel to Vietnam and take all your health"
UA-Tk9qlG9A,Well thank you! That’s good
UA-Tk9qlG9A,Hi
UA-Tk9qlG9A,"Okay, I guess"
UA-Tk9qlG9A,@JT N I understood in the sense we hope like hoping all go naturaly
UA-Tk9qlG9A,"@Lizzifer I guess I heard the word &quot;hope&quot; sarcastically as in he&#39;s saying let&#39;s hope the mom is smart enough to choose natural birth instead of surgery because, right before that, he said, &quot;If we could now understand research paper, we would now hope that our mum can bring us to the world through natural birth...&quot;"
UA-Tk9qlG9A,I guess that&#39;s why they used the word hope.<br>As in &quot;Hopefully the pregnancy/labour is smooth enough for baby to arrive naturally.&quot;<br><br>My siblings and I were all emergency C sections and we are no different to anyone else. Sometimes numbers surrounding childbirth and pregnancy are bogus cos experimenting on pregnant women and foetuses isn&#39;t something you can set out to do 😅
UA-Tk9qlG9A,"Plenty of teen moms have not only chosen life for their babies but have also raised them.  Check to see what pro-life pregnancy resource centers there are in your area.  A lot of times, they can provide you with (or point you to) resources such as prenatal care, parenting classes, free baby supplies (diapers, clothes, etc).  <br>Start talking with your baby.  Sing to your baby.  Show your baby love in all the ways you can think of.  Find supportive, non-judgmental people that can help.<br>May the good Lord give you strength, dear mother."
UA-Tk9qlG9A,You can do it 💕
UA-Tk9qlG9A,Good luck. Your decision was admirable.
UA-Tk9qlG9A,Admirable! ❤️

UA-Tk9qlG9A,"Trust in yourself and in your body / nature! Humankind would have extinguished if we were dependent of all these things we are told we have to buy ... One of my daughters even found out (when having the second child) that babies don&#39;t need diapers. They &quot;tell&quot; you (by starting to complain in a special way) that they need to go potty (you hold them over it, of course, because they cannot yet sit). It saves you a lot of money, and nature a lot of waste!"
UA-Tk9qlG9A,Hearty wishes 💞😍😍
UA-Tk9qlG9A,@R. Z. you’re most welcome. May God bless you always .
UA-Tk9qlG9A,@Rushaine C You are very kind to take your time to write these nice words to me. Thank you! It means so much to me.
UA-Tk9qlG9A,@R. Z. Also - I have many friends who have healthy babies 40+
UA-Tk9qlG9A,"@R. Z. stay positive hon. Say you will conceive and have a healthy baby - refrain from saying “you can’t”.  I’m 4 months pregnant @40 with my first child and will have another baby. With God all things are possible and you must believe he will grant you your blessings at the right time. Don’t give up and don’t let society tells you 40 is too old. God is the ultimate decision maker - ask, have faith and it shall be given unto you in Jesus name . <br><br>Ps: take a prenatal vitamin daily even before trying to conceive. <br><br>God bless you and best wishes to you ."
UA-Tk9qlG9A,"@PC0827 Thank you dear, for this nice message. Unfortunately, I am 40 years old :("
UA-Tk9qlG9A,Thank you so much.

UA-Tk9qlG9A,Thank you im 5 weeks please give us an update?? Congrats!!
UA-Tk9qlG9A,@Oiopquatro 4 what is that suppose to mean
UA-Tk9qlG9A,Should I congratulate you?
UA-Tk9qlG9A,I wish you all the strength to do it. For you. For your baby ❤️
UA-Tk9qlG9A,"And it isn&#39;t more stressful for the baby to be ripped apart limb from limb, or have his/her skull crushed, or be poisoned or starved to death?  There is NOTHING wrong with CHOOSING adoption for one&#39;s baby.  Adopted children can work through separation/rejection issues and have healthy, happy long lives.  And even, if the parents are willing, meet and thank their bio-parents for choosing life.<br>And there is nothing wrong for getting two or more jobs to work to support and feed and provide for one&#39;s baby.  People used to work hard for their families for many years.  And kids whose parents keep a healthy perspective can apply themselves and grow out of poverty, like Dr Ben Carson and many others.<br>Premature separation due to abortion is also very emotionally (if not also physically) unhealthy for the bio-mom.  But the pro-deathers don&#39;t want to talk about all of the many negative side effects of abortion, so too many [and 1 is too many] people are clueless as to the devastating long-term effects of abortion."
UA-Tk9qlG9A,There are bacteria that the baby gets from the mom by going through the birth canal. These bacteria have long lasting effects on all kinds of things - including immune system and weight.
UA-Tk9qlG9A,6 months now? How are things? 🌺
UA-Tk9qlG9A,"Same. First pregnancy, 5 weeks and 5 days."
UA-Tk9qlG9A,Just do ur walking and eat good food not fast food.<br>No smoking and drinking.<br>See my baby she 3days old.<br>God Bless u and giving birth.Thank U LORD🛐🕊❗

UA-Tk9qlG9A,"Hey Chris, no, a vaginal birth just means not caesarean and there can be many interventions to force the baby out of the vagina. A natural birth means the mother can let her body work the baby out so to speak. This is not often the case nowadays. Apart from insurance reasons of hospitals and therefore more timed and pressured births there are many ways a birth can be stressfully forced. Some even say to give the mother painkillers effects the birth to not be natural. It&#39;s good of course that in most countries we have hospitals and can have a &quot;save&quot; birth  when the pregnancy is high-risk for example. But it&#39;s often not very natural anymore. That&#39;s why some women choose water birth for example."

UA-Tk9qlG9A,All the best to you and the boys!
UA-Tk9qlG9A,"@Ferb Yes that&#39;s actually what&#39;s lacking in the video... C-section and no breast feeding doesn&#39;t give your baby less of chance to be healthy and happy ! Also, it says nothing about how important it is for the dad to be healthy before getting pregnant... It&#39;s like women make babies by themselves ! And if you eat unhealthy food, you are to blame for your baby&#39;s futur illness..."
UA-Tk9qlG9A,"Things like saying babies do better when they breast-feed immediately are statements about what happens on average, not deterministic statements that you&#39;re doomed to fail in life if that didn&#39;t happen.  It means we should take that into account, and doctors know this, but naturally doctors will still weigh that against the risk of a premature baby dying from breathing difficulty.  You always to weigh up a number of factors in real-life circumstances.  The very fact that you&#39;re alive, whereas back in the days before medicine had become so advanced a baby born so prematurely would probably have died, shows that the treatment they gave you was probably the best thing in your specific case.  You may have lost the emotional advantages of immediate breast-feeding, but being alive is good too!"
UA-Tk9qlG9A,It’s very idealistic. If your mom loved and cared for you then you’ll be fine
UA-Tk9qlG9A,Awww the little lamb
UA-Tk9qlG9A,How&#39;s the baby?!❤❤
UA-Tk9qlG9A,"Awww! How sweet, I pray that you have a successful and safe delivery"

UA-Tk9qlG9A,@Addyurdaddy <br>What is manslaughter miscarriage.
UA-Tk9qlG9A,So did mine but back then they didn&#39;t know any better.  By most other accounts she was a good mom.  She taught me to read when she realized my school wasn&#39;t getting through to me.
UA-Tk9qlG9A,@Lecett Alcala And the millions of babies who died due manslaughter such a miscarriage ☹️
UA-Tk9qlG9A,And let’s also take a moment to mourn for the millions of babies that were killed by their mothers through abortion
UA-Tk9qlG9A,Now think about mothers in Ukraine. I work at the NICU and I can tell you it definitely affects…

UA-Tk9qlG9A,Thanks 😊
UA-Tk9qlG9A,Stick to your native language. Ask your partner or others around to stick to theirs. We also have a video in language learning during the first 5 years of life ;)
UA-Tk9qlG9A,which day was he or she borned?
UA-Tk9qlG9A,one more month❤️
UA-Tk9qlG9A,K-To Asthma as soon as the sperm makes the egg. The little cell you saw at the beginning of the video. The heart starts beating at two to three weeks.
UA-Tk9qlG9A,@Daphne Ducharme when is conception?
UA-Tk9qlG9A,Preganancy starts at conception which is day one. Science is now showing at conception that the dna of the baby and mom are different
UA-Tk9qlG9A,"We&#39;re certainly in a strange time.. But fear is your worst enemy.. Don&#39;t let it steal from the joy of your pregnancy journey and the birth of your sweet baby.. Focus on your baby and try to stay healthy the best way you can.. Not everyone has money to buy organic fruits/veggies and grassfed meats!.. Just eat sensibly and take regular safety precautions during this covid thing, you will be just fine!.. Take this time to prepare for baby, with meditating, praying, sleeping, talking and singing to your baby, or taking up small projects to prepare your home and your body for birth.. Congratulations to you, by the way! ❤"

UA-Tk9qlG9A,The navel doesn&#39;t exist yet. It forms when the umbilicus dries and falls off.
UA-Tk9qlG9A,I know that baby is connected through umbilical cord <br>But If I say navel then?

UA-Tk9qlG9A,I eat all of those fruits
UA-Tk9qlG9A,speak for yourself
UA-Tk9qlG9A,Don&#39;t count me into your &quot;no one&quot;.
UA-Tk9qlG9A,"@Elvira Hoby no, it is because the video is in perfect English and those fruits are very strange for English speaking countries which are: yes,  part of the west. Mostly Asian fruits were chosen, strange. If they want to use English in the video  to arrive to more public then they should choose fruits that are also common around the world."
UA-Tk9qlG9A,"@GhostRider659 Clothing is right, lying on the back is not. Giving birth at the hospital should not be the norm either. Vartical position, calling midwives to assist a home birth - this is what we should aim for, for all healthy low-risk pregnancies."
UA-Tk9qlG9A,"The midwife is dressed up for surgery so she doesn&#39;t contaminate the mother, infections after giving birth used to be a major killer of women in their fertile years. plus the woman is half sitting up, probably propped up on some pillows. How would you improve on this process?"

UA-Tk9qlG9A,Aww don&#39;t worry and don&#39;t let it affect you ! Even your weakness can be a strength if you look at it from a different perspective. I have seen many exceptional and successful people with parents who had autism or a disability.
UA-Tk9qlG9A,I already don&#39;t want children because I don&#39;t want to transmit them my autisim. Thinking a fetus could become an anxious kid because of events I can&#39;t control stress me out.
UA-Tk9qlG9A,Dont worry it&#39;s like rape levels of stress that can really mess the baby up. Worse case you gave the kid anxiety
UA-Tk9qlG9A,"yes, it&#39;s very great and very much visible to laymen like us!"
UA-Tk9qlG9A,"@TheWayOf Cailinn<br>So is the mold growing on your vegetables. Beeing anti abortion is okay, if you decide this for yourself. Imagine it like a tattoo, it&#39;s a lifelong commitment, and you really want it, but than oneday you wake up with the ugliest thing you never wanted on your forehead( I know it&#39;s not &quot;respectful&quot; to a living organism, but the way humans treat other humans isn&#39;t either. Please be kind, make your own choice and do not judge."
UA-Tk9qlG9A,"@EmLill Things the point I&#39;m making is that in all stages, the baby is developing. Making the baby a living organism"
UA-Tk9qlG9A,"Where/how so? I Can&#39;t see a single point regarding abortion, let alone determining why/when abortion is not ok. There&#39;s not even a heartbeat the first month, let alone neurological activity, so I can&#39;t see how you arbitrarily concluded anything in your statement."
UA-Tk9qlG9A,"well, the video is so biased towards natural birth it almost cancels out its usefullness, because cringe. i wrote a comment if still not deleted by channel or yt, on how it&#39;s inaccurate to judge the whole humankind based on one group study (not the entire population of earth, but only a group of people they studied). also that for my case that information was absolutely incorrect."
UA-Tk9qlG9A,How did they do the studies to learn all of this
UA-Tk9qlG9A,Now 48k likes and 2+M views
UA-Tk9qlG9A,"@Julie Jennings If it&#39;s better for the baby, it&#39;s important information to have. I&#39;m happier to know about the benefits than to not know. Don&#39;t deprive others of important information just because some choose not to use it."
UA-Tk9qlG9A,A lot more now
UA-Tk9qlG9A,"@Finn Delves No, beacuse God leads and directs here."
UA-Tk9qlG9A,@Finn Delves Bavsaue He doesn&#39;t force himself on anybody.
UA-Tk9qlG9A,Agnosticism is logical atheism a choice but theism is illogical
UA-Tk9qlG9A,"@Finn Delves Who says He isn&#39;t? At least He wants us to have this conversation. Wherein I&#39;ll point you to your need of a saviour for all the things you&#39;ve done that are against God&#39;s will. As a righteous God, God has to punish wickedness. But as a loving God at the same time, He sent His Son, Jesus Christ, to live a perfect live and to bear all the wrath for all who believe on Him as their only way to eternal salvation. God promised in His Word, the Bible, that whoever calls upon Him shall be saved. So I&#39;ll pray that you turn from your evil way to Jesus. He has saved me, so He is definitely able to save you too! I&#39;ll pray that God will work the need to be saved in your heart. Come to Christ, brother... You need him!"
UA-Tk9qlG9A,@Joost Bakker Then why didn&#39;t he make me believe in him.

UA-Tk9qlG9A,"Inshal Ansari sorry I missed the Oviparous when I read “children”. So in that case, everything the developing animal needs is in the egg. When the egg is made, it is packed full of chemicals from the mothers bodies. That is why eggs are so large compared to the zygote and that is why eggs are so nutritious. And they don’t need oxygen because of the same reason I explained bellow for viviparous   <br><br> ————<br>the egg develops into other things after the sperm fuses. Everything needed for zygote to embryo to fetus development comes from the placenta and umbilical cord<br><br>The reason we breathe is to keep our metabolism going (oxygen is reactive), so to keep the chemical reactions in our body going so we can stay alive. Since the mother is already doing that, she can use the chemicals she already has to provide for the growing baby. <br>So the fetus doesn’t need oxygen, and it’s lungs actually fill with amniotic fluid while they’re in the womb (not in egg, because baby developed FROM egg,  egg developed into baby&amp;placenta). I imagine the fetus may push and pull amniotic fluid in &amp; out of it’s lungs when it’s bored"

vjt-axomdBE,Mines behind on some areas
vjt-axomdBE,Same!
vjt-axomdBE,@Khandi McLaughlin yay that’s so good to hear!!! I hope so. My baby is too interested in everything else around him lol he just plays &amp; nonstop running! That’s okay we’ll just keep trying 🤞🏼
vjt-axomdBE,"@Kiki Malla hey there hun!! Today my daughter started saying thank you, counting to 5 and good night!! All in one day!! So it does take time sometimes...I had to remember to just be patient. I bet you baby is going to start saying whole sentences all of a sudden"
vjt-axomdBE,My baby is 18 months and doesn’t even say that 🥺 he says like mam (food) and baba and mama but I don’t think he even associates me with the word mama. You’re right and I keep getting told all babies are different.
vjt-axomdBE,"Hi, a year late but any updates? My son is 18 months and doesn’t point either."
vjt-axomdBE,@Branson Brendan lately I have been using FlixZone. Just search on google for it :)
vjt-axomdBE,i guess Im kinda off topic but do anyone know of a good place to watch newly released series online?
vjt-axomdBE,@Belinda Ransby thank you💞
vjt-axomdBE,"@Belinda Ransby I am very glad to find this comment. My son’s pediatrician recommended hearing tests, speech therapy, putting him in daycare, and having an autism review done and he’s only 18 months old and we’re in the middle of a pandemic! I do luckily have the luxury to be with him every day, and I don’t take that for granted by any means. It’s not like I don’t teach him, or try to... we work very hard on language but it’s just not happening for him as quick as others. He picked up the word “hi” this week. Along with “Alexa” from hearing us talk to her all of the time. I cried thinking that they would just slap the large umbrella term AUTISM on him, when I genuinely feel it’s too soon to tell in his case. I even work with autistic children, and my opinion was thrown to the wayside."
vjt-axomdBE,@Nikki Nicole Don&#39;t feel bad.... It&#39;s perfectly normal. All babies develop at their pace. My daughter never said a word until she was 2. Couldn&#39;t stop her talking once she got started😆
vjt-axomdBE,"Hey did he ever get any better ? My daughter is acting similar but she laughs , have some sort of reaction . She doesn’t respond to her name or point . She claps though . She says no but I don’t know if she does it because she really means no or not ..."
vjt-axomdBE,Mine too 🙂 I wouldn&#39;t worry<br> They have until 24 months to say words Ans of the don&#39;t get will see a speech therapist . I was a late talker And I&#39;m fine.
vjt-axomdBE,Hell I tossed it the second I saw teeth the Pediatric dr. Agreed saying it&#39;s nothing but a habit after 6months
vjt-axomdBE,@Jenni H It&#39;s true. My son is 18 months and when he counts he points or has objects that he is showing the numbers with. I am very hands on with his development but he actually started doing that on his own. Some children understand the concept of counting rather early but most are repeating what they hear.
vjt-axomdBE,@J McK At 18 months my oldest could count to 10. It was route memorization and she didn&#39;t understand what she was doing but she could count. Also some very gifted children can actually count and understand what the numbers mean as early as 12 months. It&#39;s incredibly unlikely but definitely possible.
vjt-axomdBE,"@J McK My 18mo old can also count to 10, but she misses numbers and needs me to count with her. We&#39;ve been practicing counting since she was 1yr old. Some kids pick up verbal skills faster than others. It could be BS, but it might also be a fast learner."
vjt-axomdBE,Zaria bullshit
vjt-axomdBE,"Ismail Sharifi there’s nothing to fix! Your son is beautiful and perfect. Love him the way he is,  he’s ready when he ready or that’s just his nature."
vjt-axomdBE,Kasey Fletcher what kind of mimicry? i may be able to help you
vjt-axomdBE,@TurnOver TheLeaf mine too
vjt-axomdBE,@TurnOver TheLeaf same with my 18m son
vjt-axomdBE,"Really??! My son doesn&#39;t say anything besides Dada @18 months. But shows no signs of autism,  etc.."
vjt-axomdBE,Same
vjt-axomdBE,Mine too! Is your kid ok now?!
vjt-axomdBE,Mine too ☹️
vjt-axomdBE,Kattykat49 same. Has your toddler made any improvements?
vjt-axomdBE,"@Andrea E So, an update from 4 years ago. Two months after my post, he had an operation called a myringotomy. Basically, doctors believe he has excess ear fluid that wasn&#39;t draining properly. Affecting his ability to hear and process new words. They installed some hourglass shaped tubes into his ear drum to help with drainage.  My son is in first grade now. He has an amazing memory and vocabulary, and communicates fairly well. About average in math, slightly above average in reading. He definitely has attention/focus issues, so I don&#39;t think the ear thing was a 100% solution, but he grew at his own pace. I wanted to share because I remember how nerve wracking it was to have these concerns and such inconsistent information."
vjt-axomdBE,Randall Syfert. My son is 18 mos old and does the same thing. Says noises &quot;DueyDueyDuey&quot; instead of talk or say words. Says &quot;mamamama&quot; &quot;dadadada&quot;.  Every other milestone is coming along.
vjt-axomdBE,Randall Syfert this can be very stressful. I feel with parents going through this in my line of work. If you&#39;d like to reach out to me can answer any questions as best I can ☺
vjt-axomdBE,"Randall Syfert hi i feel the exact same way but what i tell myself most days is give him time, love him lots and teach him, give him the chance to be himself and blossom, especially if he&#39;s reached the other milestones and im sure surpassed some. My son started interacting more and saying a bit more, follow your gut and be his biggest advocate 😊"
vjt-axomdBE,How is your kid my friend?
vjt-axomdBE,Hailey Barker speak to their Doctor and PRAY to JESUS about it. GOD BLESS.
vjt-axomdBE,Leonidas Thao every child is so different and these milestones are quite flexible.
vjt-axomdBE,"@AT Valle hi, so I&#39;m another overly concerned parent. How can I DM you?"
vjt-axomdBE,"My baby is 15 months and is not talking, maybe because boys develop words later but his Dr wanted him saying 3 words by 12 months. He does say Mom, mama, baba, ball, papaw (not clearly) but I&#39;m not sure he knows what it means as it&#39;s vague."
vjt-axomdBE,AmazingABA every child is so<br>So different. I am a child development consultant and can help answer any questions you may have.
vjt-axomdBE,AmazingABA o
vjt-axomdBE,@drmahesh shenoy how is it going Mahesh? Can you give us an update
vjt-axomdBE,@Elizabeth Conyers my eighteen year old doesn&#39;t speak although points sometimes.. I&#39;m worried about how to go about.. what are your updates
vjt-axomdBE,"AmazingABA my daughter at 18 months only says Dadda, momma and hot."
vjt-axomdBE,At the pediatrician they are babies till 2 and as far as people referring to their own children baby insinuates youngest and it&#39;s hard to give up on them being a baby.
vjt-axomdBE,To me there are still babies...at 2 maybe even 3
vjt-axomdBE,@liloboy911808 how is your baby doing?
vjt-axomdBE,+Daisy Maha well now at 2 in just a few days. Her walking has improved a lot. She sometimes get her falls when running. But even that is slowly getting better. Her words are improvising good too.  She saying more words then daddy all the time. She can even say about 2 or more sentences at times. Even does a great job memorizing the songs from your favorite cartoon shows she sings along too. Pointing however... not too much! Hoping that will improve once she is 3. :)
vjt-axomdBE,"+liloboy911808 hii... hows ur toddler doing now ?? i have a 18 month girl ... all her milestones are achieved except talking ... she just says Daddy that too once in a blue moon, though she has her own babbling language."
vjt-axomdBE,Einstein did not start speaking until he was four
vjt-axomdBE,+pitipe my daughter moves a lot too. she usually calm when she&#39;s watching tv lol 😊
vjt-axomdBE,+liloboy911808 great to see that she has been improving so much. I hope my son stays still when doing the test. :)
vjt-axomdBE,"@pitipe​ well the last time we took her they ran a few test. Such as, having her focus on sounds on which direction they&#39;re coming from, looking at pictures and stuff. She did great and pass. They did say she maybe just a little late on speech. Because back then she was not saying much. Now at 2 years old she does say a few words including a few sentences (2 or 3 maybe) . Her pointing...is ok!, ﻿her walking has improve great"
vjt-axomdBE,"+liloboy911808 Mine have an appointment too, how did everything went?"
vjt-axomdBE,you are describing red flags of Autism spectrum disorder.
vjt-axomdBE,"Neither does my son, he just attacks what he wants (i mean reaches for it)<br>He doesn&#39;t respond to his name but he responds to Baby, Swamp Monster and Wrecking Ball hahaha<br>I&#39;m not worried at all. I just stop predicting his needs so he has to ask or point... It&#39;s harder for me not to use the pet names so it may be a while for his name to set in"
vjt-axomdBE,babies just grow at they&#39;re own rate maybe it might take your daughter a litté longer to do things it&#39;s normal
vjt-axomdBE,May she focuses on something else or has ear infection you should ask her doc.
vjt-axomdBE,"I feel the same. Please, tell me did anything has changed month later? (sorry for bad english)"

M2sqXbwlaWw,Music is haram??

M2sqXbwlaWw,Diego Arias how do u make music theory and initial learning and exercises interesting? not easy:)
M2sqXbwlaWw,"Totally right, i’m a music teacher here in Uruguay and Brazil and I see it everyday. If my lessons aren’t fun they’ll do a mess in classroom and lose interest in music.

Jt3-PIC2nCs,Lmao
Jt3-PIC2nCs,I have acquired the child
Jt3-PIC2nCs,Children 2-7 are egocentric 🙄. It&#39;s called Id
Jt3-PIC2nCs,@xblackcatx13 what else is there to do?
Jt3-PIC2nCs,What? this video is actually mediocre at best
Jt3-PIC2nCs,@Fatima Koui That is the best part.
Jt3-PIC2nCs,plus the video shuts up when you want it to 😑😂
Jt3-PIC2nCs,😂😂😂😂
Jt3-PIC2nCs,It seems like I wrote...
Jt3-PIC2nCs,Sounds like every person in politics is preoperational.
Jt3-PIC2nCs,Egocentric haha!!
Jt3-PIC2nCs,lol dnd player?
Jt3-PIC2nCs,I want to know the same thing
Jt3-PIC2nCs,Trinity Salazar You are correct. She needs to correct that.
Jt3-PIC2nCs,"The explanations are not correct.  I would double check what you may have picked up from this video from other material.  The explanation for example of object permanence during the sensorimotor stage was grossly inaccurate.  She explained the opposite of the definition stating that a child cannot recognize an object once it is out of sight when during this stage a child is recognizing in fact that the object still exist even when it is not in sight.  I would question the rest of the video&#39;s information, just fyi."
Jt3-PIC2nCs,"Yeah it is lol. It&#39;s weird how we can make assumptions about a person&#39;s appearance based on their voice, isn&#39;t it?"
Jt3-PIC2nCs,Honestly her voice is so attractive it&#39;s distracting. Lmao
Jt3-PIC2nCs,aaaaahhhhhh nnnnnooooo!!!!!!! :):)
Jt3-PIC2nCs,PLOT TWIST:<br><br>It&#39;s a man.
Jt3-PIC2nCs,"me too, i wouldnt mind"
Jt3-PIC2nCs,"I think you weren&#39;t paying attention, &#39;cause that was actually what she was explaining. She said, up until the concrete operational stage, the child will answer incorrectly. And that you can test if a child have reached the operational stage by the answer."
Jt3-PIC2nCs,@Sunshine Soulfull is thre igcse psychology
Jt3-PIC2nCs,Barth Slunghh
Jt3-PIC2nCs,"I think you weren&#39;t paying attention, &#39;cause that was actually what she <br>was explaining. She said, up until the concrete operational stage, the <br>child will answer incorrectly. And that you can test if a child have <br>reached the operational stage by the answer."
Jt3-PIC2nCs,@Gabriel It&#39;s for Piaget&#39;s theory
Jt3-PIC2nCs,@T Sal 🙄
Jt3-PIC2nCs,Candice Goddard exactly my sister could speak at 9 months
Jt3-PIC2nCs,You know they were also incorrect during the sensorimotor stage.  Their understanding for object permanence was the complete opposite of the definition. I have absolutely no faith in any of their other videos going forward now.
Jt3-PIC2nCs,"+Candice Goddard  It is true, but she&#39;s explaining it the way Piaget had intended. The ages Piaget described are one of the few things other psychologists disagree on about Piaget&#39;s theory. He seemed to underestimate the abilities of what children can actually do."
Jt3-PIC2nCs,This American life produced a long episode that was completely antithetical to this suggesting that children are much more like little scientists compiling poor data that is increasingly representative. It’s called kid logic; it seems to provide a more balanced perspective on kids observations in a way that’s more determined by language than this flimsy model.
Jt3-PIC2nCs,Raisa agree!
Jt3-PIC2nCs,Honestly it bothers me how attracted to her voice I am.... lol
Jt3-PIC2nCs,Why
Jt3-PIC2nCs,ikr?!
Jt3-PIC2nCs,My thoughts exactly
Jt3-PIC2nCs,@Raibale Rana bb
Jt3-PIC2nCs,"Piaget didn’t get Schroedingers(sp) PM... :-P “permanence”, lol."
Jt3-PIC2nCs,i thought i was the only one confused by her explanation!
Jt3-PIC2nCs,Ferdinand Mravenec okay... But the lady in this video was describing object permanence wrong. So I was giving her an example as to what my son does.
Jt3-PIC2nCs,"My 13-month-old son is always looking for things when I take them away. Sure, he&#39;ll lose interest after a while but he will look for it. He did that even before one."
Jt3-PIC2nCs,"OMG, hold on everyone, object permanence is a lie and SHE DISCOVERED THE CONSPIRACY, FUCKING PEEKABOO IS A GODDAMN CONSPIRACY AND HER GOD-GENIUS BABY SHOWED HER, ANOTHER PROBABLY STRAIGHT A COLLEGE STUDENT OFFERING NOTHING.  HOW  about explain how your baby grew out of this stage and explain these characteristics and G and D patterns"
Jt3-PIC2nCs,@***** jesus christ. chill out geoff
Jt3-PIC2nCs,@*****  Calm down!
Jt3-PIC2nCs,"@sylver hyacinth doronila This is a very basic and short explanation of Piaget&#39;s theory of cognitive development. What they didn&#39;t mention in the video is that object permanence has it&#39;s own stages of development. Infants begin to develop their very earliest understanding of OP when they&#39;re around 8 to 12 months old, later they become more successful in retrieving concealed objects and by the end of the sensorimotor stage, which is around 18 to 24 months of age, they should fully understand the concept of object permanence. Your son seems to have acted accordingly, it&#39;s not unusual for his age. Some recent evidence show that slight awareness of object permanence can happen even earlier than Piaget asserted. "

WanGt1G6ScA,I almost had a panic attack just reading that
WanGt1G6ScA,Most psychological studies are like that. The whole field is a joke.
WanGt1G6ScA,My step-brother Alphonse loves you so very much! Turn to Alphonse before it&#39;s too late 😳
WanGt1G6ScA,why believe that
WanGt1G6ScA,They don&#39;t say it&#39;s a fear of heights test.
WanGt1G6ScA,"@Elijah Krueger <br>No, you are not. I also kinda added the fading slide whistle from the old Wile E. Coyote cartoons, in my head as I watch."
WanGt1G6ScA,"They could show children a scene where a toy falls off and gets hurt, and see if it influences their behavior. Well, someone&#39;s probably already done it. It&#39;s just not on YouTube"
WanGt1G6ScA,"Yes and babygates are bad ideas. They should be afraid of stairs, not flinging themselves as hard as they can at bars"
WanGt1G6ScA,@naproupi I said that they worked on their ideas (aka theory) and made a new test though...
WanGt1G6ScA,"@Alex Read No, first you doubt, then you spend time contruscting a different theory, then you do your own test and only when your theory proves more accurate than the previous one you get to call the previous one wrong.<br>Just doubting a theory because you disagree is not science."
WanGt1G6ScA,My favorite part of them is specifically about a certain documentary that a lot of clips come from and through the entire thing they call them &quot;baby humans&quot;
WanGt1G6ScA,"My favorite part is that that&#39;s how you do science. The people making this test probably did the same looking at the older videos of the visual cliff, then worked on their ideas to make a new test."
WanGt1G6ScA,"I had to take my Child psychology class 3 times in college because life just kept getting in the way of school 😂. I’m currently about 9 days away from having a baby, and I am so excited to watch my son develop and learn about the world around him. My husband keeps making fun of me for being a nerd."
WanGt1G6ScA,Me tOo!
WanGt1G6ScA,Wow that&#39;s horrible 😥
WanGt1G6ScA,@Neon Pilot agree to disagree
WanGt1G6ScA,I do not agree
WanGt1G6ScA,"I propose we set babies on the edge of a real 60 foot cliif, and stand back and watch the authentic experiment."
WanGt1G6ScA,They&#39;re both called kids.
WanGt1G6ScA,"So then her fear of heights is learned, just as this research suggests"
WanGt1G6ScA,"As a point that may be useful to know, the novel takes place on a planet with so many suns it is nearly always light outside. Except that one time every once in a long while where it goes totally dark. And of course, civilization goes bananas."
WanGt1G6ScA,"@Rachel Dewinata It&#39;s likely that the person was moving their fist slowly, so it didn&#39;t seem like a real punch or attack"
WanGt1G6ScA,"@Betül Sorry, this doesn&#39;t sound like a valid method. There are too many factors involved, why someone would back down from a moving hand/fist."
WanGt1G6ScA,@Rachel Dewinata This is a great way teachers used to understand if their student get abused at home. They raise their hand to student for stroking their hair or cheeck to show appreciation but abused kids think teacher gonna beat them so they hide reflexively.
WanGt1G6ScA,You should be concerned when they DID react. Because that means that had experienced it and knew the result of that. I always had an instinct to protect my face whenever someone kicked a ball near me. Because I&#39;ve received stray balls to the face way too many times to feel comfortable with it. Same with me as a kid avoiding balloons because they exploded on my face once and it hurts.
WanGt1G6ScA,@Jazz59107 of course in a baby experiment
WanGt1G6ScA,@Jeffzzzz How would you ever use that
WanGt1G6ScA,you are.
WanGt1G6ScA,That burn is actually really good<br>Im gonna use that lmao
WanGt1G6ScA,Pushing babies off cliffs?
WanGt1G6ScA,"Maybe because they now know the adults will catch them as soon as they are in danger, so they don&#39;t care anymore and take it as a game."
WanGt1G6ScA,Maybe it&#39;s the eye level
WanGt1G6ScA,Luciana I&#39;ve seen a baby do the same!! It was at a family reunion and practically every adult immediately dove in to get him 😂 <br>But yea walked straight in
WanGt1G6ScA,"yutuniopati It’s almost like you only watched the first minute of the video, and then still chose to make a comment even though you don’t have all of the information."
WanGt1G6ScA,This experiment was to show whether or not babies innately develop a fear of heights during the period of crawling
WanGt1G6ScA,Burgundy Did you not watch the entire video?
WanGt1G6ScA,Just from the video i got: 1. Learn to sit 2. Learn to crawl 3. Begin cruising(pulling self up and leaning or holding things to move around)  4. Learn to walk<br><br>So yes!
WanGt1G6ScA,Can you give a time-stamp for what you mean?
WanGt1G6ScA,"WeAreSoPredictable If that’s the case, why did they go back to being reluctant each time they graduated to the next mobility stage?"
WanGt1G6ScA,"Yeah I&#39;m not sure what the point here is either, where&#39;s the benefit?"
WanGt1G6ScA,LoliRock_WinxClub Girl Did you watch the video? Because your comment says you didn’t.
WanGt1G6ScA,Sorry ma&#39;am.
WanGt1G6ScA,AbishekMahe It’s almost like you didn’t actually watch the video. 🤔🤫

WanGt1G6ScA,æ
WanGt1G6ScA,this comment is more entertaining than the video :D
WanGt1G6ScA,？？
WanGt1G6ScA,@WeedyistFlame420 LMAO
WanGt1G6ScA,the experiment is legit. even though we dont have the answer in this video. this woman has done this test for 25 years. do you really think she never thought of this problem? she probably did some studies with something around the baby and some rope. and found out that the infants would still act the same way. then why not keep doing that? maybe some infants didnt want the &quot;harness&quot; on or one of them got hurt while falling because the rope tightened while an arm was in the way.
WanGt1G6ScA,Doge Games It’s almost like you didn’t watch the video 🤔
WanGt1G6ScA,nope. according to you watching the video for 2 minutes means knowing what the whole video is about!
WanGt1G6ScA,@🌝 yes
WanGt1G6ScA,@🌝 danger = eat waoaoad
WanGt1G6ScA,its a common human instinct

WanGt1G6ScA,Lemon Feminist idea of hardwork
WanGt1G6ScA,"Well, it is a video about an experiment showing that a previous experiment was “stoopid”, so it instills natural further questioning of methodology and conclusions."

WanGt1G6ScA,@Tree Of Rage Aren&#39;t some people actually afraid of heights? They have the &#39;fear of heights&#39;? They can&#39;t stand on a glass floor on a high place for example? Even though thay know that it&#39;s impossible to fall
WanGt1G6ScA,Good observation and comment
WanGt1G6ScA,"@Tree Of Rage I&#39;m not afraid of falling, I&#39;m afraid of hitting the ground at the end of the fall."
WanGt1G6ScA,"That&#39;s what a fear of heights is. Noone is afraid of heights, they are afraid of falling."
WanGt1G6ScA,@Hendrik 👏 exactly. It&#39;s  called hypothesis.
WanGt1G6ScA,That could paralize the baby. Harnesses are not meant for use until you reach a certain age
WanGt1G6ScA,@Joshua M well... As evil as that is... I think its more realistic and would change the test results.
WanGt1G6ScA,Get the hands and the cable away and let them fall
WanGt1G6ScA,Agreed
WanGt1G6ScA,LOL
WanGt1G6ScA,"Amp i think it&#39;s less about makong people sad, and more about having an ethical test..."
WanGt1G6ScA,If you ever had kids you&#39;ll now thet don&#39;t measure injury nor danger. That&#39;s why the fall off beds or high places..... so with parent or not chances are they will do the same.
WanGt1G6ScA,"greenyoshi119 yea when I started the video I thought they were going to use pads for the falls. I mean babies are made to fall, a cushioned landing would be just fine. I guess they didn&#39;t want controversy, also some babies may cry from the shock and that would make people sad.  But also, if they really did fall and cried (didn&#39;t like the falling sensation, I would have liked it as a baby lol) they could develop a fear of heights and that would kind of ruin the whole experiment"
WanGt1G6ScA,"It showed that fear of heights isn&#39;t an inevitable part of development, it is learned. (Which was the hypothesis so wooooo)<br>But she also discovered that we have to relearn this connection of our bodies and ledges when we begin to walk, so that is a bonus. I think the experiment was fine"
WanGt1G6ScA,Alex Victoria They could use a harness like in mountain climbing.
WanGt1G6ScA,"If that were the case, the babies would get more confident walking off the edge, not less."
WanGt1G6ScA,This almost kills my back. My daughter suddenly jump over the bed hooping for me to catch Her. That result in rather chronic back pain (my daughter quite a GIANT baby) and couples of times I am not fast enough to catch Her. Ouch! (×﹏×)
WanGt1G6ScA,"actually, she was trying to say that fear is not involved and the babies had to relearn how to navigate every time they changed position. <br><br>So even after learning from crawl position (stop right at the edge, turn around, and hang) they then have to relearn when they get to cruise position (to stop, crouch, hang down, etc.). You can see when the babies began to walk, most ran right off the edge. <br><br>They then had to relearn all over again when they began walking because it again changes the relationship between their body and their environment. (She said there were four learning curves; learn to navigate from sitting, crawling, cruising, and then walking)"
WanGt1G6ScA,Robin Hyliger Gotta catch em all
WanGt1G6ScA,Even though the babies know there&#39;re adult protecting them they aren&#39;t too reliant on it that much. The adult seems to make them more confident but those babies still show sign of caution with or without them. If they indeed don&#39;t care about consequences why would they happily crawl/walk off the ledge at first but learn to be more cautious later?
WanGt1G6ScA,"actually, they also found that babies had to relearn how to navigate every time they changed position. <br><br>So even after learning from crawl position (stop right at the edge, turn around, and hang) they then have to relearn when they get to cruise position (to stop, crouch, hang down, etc.).

WanGt1G6ScA,Us
WanGt1G6ScA,While babies in rural white neighbourhoods of caravan communities go starving everyday
WanGt1G6ScA,"This is a huge thing because it is also about what part does fear play on us learning common sense and what is right and wrong. Do we do what we do, be it whatever it is, just because of fear or not?"
WanGt1G6ScA,"Most of them, if not all, look like they are figuring out how to navigate the ledges and slopes themselves.  The adults aren&#39;t catching them. They did the first couple of runs because they didn&#39;t want them to fall. Also letting them fall could have them develop a fear which would ruin the whole experiment. <br>ALSO it&#39;s not an experiment to see how well infants navigate ledges, it&#39;s to understand how and when humans make connections"
WanGt1G6ScA,the experiment is legit. even though we dont have the answer in this video. this woman has done this test for 25 years. do you really think she never thought of this problem? she probably did some studies with something around the baby and some rope. and found out that the infants would still act the same way. then why not keep doing that? maybe some infants didnt want the &quot;harnas&quot; on or one of them got hurt while falling because the rope tightened while an arm was in the way.

WanGt1G6ScA,I watched a youtube video saying that the actual fear of hight is the fear of actually jumping of that cliff. Don’t recall the name of the vid though but I found it pretty interesting
WanGt1G6ScA,Agreed that it&#39;s not a fear of heights. They&#39;re just aware that it&#39;s a deep drop off that the baby is aware of. How deep and dangerous it is
WanGt1G6ScA,"actually, she was trying to say that fear is not involved and the babies had to relearn how to navigate every time they changed position. <br><br>So even after learning from crawl position (stop right at the edge, turn around, and hang) they then have to relearn when they get to cruise position (to stop, crouch, hang down, etc.).

WanGt1G6ScA,"Incurablederp me too. And now I&#39;m still unable to jump over a big gap ditch, around 80cm or more, is enought to make me scared. I prefer to take a longer walk than jump over it. Lol"

WanGt1G6ScA,This is now the top comment. It has me rolling 😂😂
WanGt1G6ScA,😆
WanGt1G6ScA,So she’s a Catcher in the Rye? 🤔
WanGt1G6ScA,this comment omg hahahaha xD
WanGt1G6ScA,"Cause and effect is learned over time,  if you fall,  you learn from that,  but and infant must be monitored to be sure he or she doesn&#39;t get into harms way,  Adolf is trying out a Scenario to see a response,  but not the way the original activity was conducted, it was the child is coaxed to crawl toward the mom who is instructed to ignore the clear glass or the drop off point,  and then see if the child keeps going,  if she does it is considered atypical but crying and asking to be picked up is the typical response."
WanGt1G6ScA,omfg people in the comment section are fucking rekking today
WanGt1G6ScA,"Maddy yeah, nothing bad except for crushing not fully developed skull or breaking neck. Great idea."
WanGt1G6ScA,"Maddy but I think there is a balance to be struck. I won&#39;t let my infant fall off the couch, but I will let her crawl to the edge and begin to fall, catching her at the last second so she gets the sensation of falling without the risk of injury. I will let her fall if she&#39;s just walking on flat ground, though."
WanGt1G6ScA,Samantha O&#39;Hargadon not exactly!
WanGt1G6ScA,I&#39;ve been firing babies out of cannons for years and this is somewhat accurate.
WanGt1G6ScA,Depends to what you compare them.
WanGt1G6ScA,Bro I can tell u now that if they were in some random test room alone they would burst into tears and not go anywhere. I have a feeling you’ve never been around children?
WanGt1G6ScA,They studied for 25 years<br>Dont act like your argument that you made in 1 second matters
WanGt1G6ScA,"But they already tried that with the &quot;Visual Cliff&quot;, that&#39;s what they built their research on. Sure, the mothers were present but no one held the babies. Plus a baby that cannot see their mother is usually stressed or at least feels uneasy and since they observe the babies facial expressions it might cause interference with the collected data. Oh man, science and psychology is a hard one..."
WanGt1G6ScA,"that&#39;s just a harmful experiment, in my opinion. people will call that cruel human experimentation."
WanGt1G6ScA,Babies don&#39;t associate their mother with always being able to catch them before they fall.
WanGt1G6ScA,@k R same but literally everybody knows. This is more about tracking the progress than anything anyway
WanGt1G6ScA,its the worst like they are trying to sound smart on a video coment section lmao
WanGt1G6ScA,No One salt
WanGt1G6ScA,I retract my comment
WanGt1G6ScA,Hendrik. You understand sarcasm very well.
WanGt1G6ScA,@Miss Amanda&#39;s world drop the baby 😈
WanGt1G6ScA,"Yeah let’s just let them fall off the edge why don’t we? Because you, a random commenter on YouTube are more knowledgeable on an experiment done by a professional who’s probably studied this for years 🤨"
WanGt1G6ScA,yea yea this test is cool and all but now do it without support
WanGt1G6ScA,"@Massimo Scognamiglio no the only way is to let them die for their mistakes...<br>But seriously they should try to find ways to negate this variable, like introducing a small harness or only using babies for 1-2 trials so that they don&#39;t learn that they are being supported."
WanGt1G6ScA,@Gunnar How else will the baby learn to hike?
WanGt1G6ScA,Gunnar maybe they stopped on the hike to take a break or eat or smth and when they put the baby down he started to crawl
WanGt1G6ScA,Sounds like he has the right idea.  Doesn&#39;t stand with a scared look on his face but figures out a way to make it possible

WanGt1G6ScA,"And for the hundreds of explanations for each baby:  You&#39;re probably thinking that everyone is different and would react different, but for developmental milestones the psychology is pretty uniform."
WanGt1G6ScA,"You&#39;ve never seen a baby afraid of something?? 😶<br><br>Usually if they meet a new person, especially if they look different from who they&#39;re use to, they will become scared. Not just cautious of that new person, but they may try to get away or have a fit (fear)"
WanGt1G6ScA,people dont watch the whole video annie! are you crazy? if you learned anything in the first 2 minutes that basically means watching all of it. duhh
WanGt1G6ScA,The researcher literally said in the video that she didn’t think the babies were afraid
WanGt1G6ScA,Fear is probably one of the most basic human emotions. Babies&#39; can and do feel fear.

WanGt1G6ScA,+TheSwampHumanoid You are applying your adult experience and rational thinking to this problem. And you are making a conclusion based on a few minuets long video of the study.
WanGt1G6ScA,@Elisha Fore Even though the babies know there&#39;re adult protecting them they aren&#39;t too reliant on it that much. The adult seems to make them more confident but those babies still show sign of caution with or without them. If they indeed don&#39;t care about consequences why would they happily crawl/walk off the ledge at first but learn to be more cautious later?
WanGt1G6ScA,"^ I agree, the only thing they are observing here is that the baby will repeat the mistake because there are no consequences. &quot;mom catches me every time i jump off this really high cliff, seems fun to me&quot;. "
aymvX-OrlS0,"Realize what has happened by using the technology we have today. Call it feedback. I&#39;m gonna be 40 soon as well, and I&#39;m realizing more and more what happened when I was a child. Using what you see now, to rectify what happens from this point on."
aymvX-OrlS0,"@Sir Prize It&#39;s nice to know I&#39;m not alone. Stay strong my guy, we&#39;ll be happy someday."
aymvX-OrlS0,"Exactly the same on everything you said. Essentially only kept alive because if you died it&#39;d be a crime, that&#39;s how it was. I also made the same wish for offing myself, but someone has to live. Male suicide is fucking insanely high, and someone has to live. We don&#39;t have to go like this, I have the same emptiness now, just 1 months later, but I think if we find the core issue it could be fixed. I had some unknown need, what felt like craving for something I know I never really felt before. I think it was affection, very high chance it is. Try to work with your feelings and maybe we can get through this."
aymvX-OrlS0,I was really shy too I couldn&#39;t even think of anything to say cause my parents always said that children should be seen and not  heard. I had to teach myself to socialize would you believe?  At least I don&#39;t have a friend problem cause i always had plenty of friends. I was a really good kid who turned into a drug addict and a drug dealer....this is really sad I could have been a lot of things but the severe abuse I experienced when I was a kid ruined my life and my sister and brothers life as well.
aymvX-OrlS0,There are however parents who intentionally hurt their children. Parents who enjoy seeing their children suffer. They exist.
aymvX-OrlS0,Me too. I would hide in my closet to cry 😥 such a sad childhood
aymvX-OrlS0,"Honestly, I&#39;m sick &amp; tired of ppl who haven&#39;t spent a minute sitting with me, speaking with me &amp; getting to know ME saying that I haven&#39;t healed my childhood wounds &amp; undermining everything I worked through in order to do so. The pain I have is relative to my current situations &amp; that&#39;s that. STOP BLAMING MY CHILDHOOD CUZ I HAVE!!! 👌🏼💯💜"
aymvX-OrlS0,It sure feels that way ☹️
aymvX-OrlS0,💔
aymvX-OrlS0,So true!<br>Also very defensive when &#39;other people&#39; show you affection. It feels like it&#39;s not normal.
aymvX-OrlS0,"I feel awkward, my body feels numb!💔"
aymvX-OrlS0,Exactly
aymvX-OrlS0,"Omg, this was me. I was immediately given to my grandparents after birth and didn&#39;t really see my mother regularly until I was about 7!!!!!"
aymvX-OrlS0,"That&#39;s hardest part here for everyone  that&#39;s never understood the people that say don&#39;t live in the past, it&#39;s not the past if its still happening"
aymvX-OrlS0,"Only Lord Jesus Christ can heal and restored us. It is a process, but look for Him, if you can get an old version Bible (King James or Reina Valera 1960), and pray to God. Ask Him to help you, He is our Heavenly Father, He will listen to you. I hope you the best in Lord Jesus name."
aymvX-OrlS0,I hope things will get better ❤️
aymvX-OrlS0,Exactly dude
aymvX-OrlS0,I can absolutely relate.
aymvX-OrlS0,@M.C. this is the most psychotic shit I&#39;ve ever read. You&#39;re not a Dr. I see a psychiatrist and no I don&#39;t. You have no right to go around trying to diagnose people off a sentence.
aymvX-OrlS0,"Prayers to you brave child, a day at a time, you will find love, you will find a family of your own someday and you will treasure it. Good luck"
aymvX-OrlS0,"The fact that you question that makes you already better prepared than I was. I had never held a baby or seen one up close (apart from my sister when I was three) untill I was pregnant with my oldest. And God was I ill prepared, coming from an abusive background. I waited years to call child services on myself and still regret I did not do so years earlier. It was the best thing that happened to us, but I will never forgive myself for the emotional scars my kids carry."
aymvX-OrlS0,"Because babies are humans that need constant attention, the parent needs to be stable both financially and mentally. So if you&#39;re not ready please don&#39;t have a child."
aymvX-OrlS0,@Ny Ny maybe maybe not I guess it&#39;s a individual situation love
aymvX-OrlS0,@La west philly if it came naturally this video WOULDN&#39;T exist
aymvX-OrlS0,Misogynist
aymvX-OrlS0,yep. some is ok. but yeah. wow.<br>no choice.
aymvX-OrlS0,"@Kim Jasmine agreed!! Personally, I equate religion with pedophilia..  I mean that&#39;s what&#39;s been shoved down my ocular tunnels since I was younger..  their greed supercedes their real quest... It&#39;s beyond a flawed empire"
aymvX-OrlS0,Also before those who want to study to be pastors. Teach them how to deal with people appropriately for the betterment of all.
aymvX-OrlS0,@alyanuuuh_ yea.. I agree
aymvX-OrlS0,yeah like fix your own trauma before raising a child rather than having the child suffer YOUR trauma
aymvX-OrlS0,"Pretty sure this isn&#39;t how it works. Just because you&#39;re wearing a face mask doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re not interacting with your child at all.<br><br>Though if they&#39;re wearing masks and constantly staying 6 feet away from their child? Then yeah, that&#39;s gonna cause some trauma."
aymvX-OrlS0,Talking about being neglected and seeking refuge and acceptance does not equate to &quot;not as neglected as you thought&quot;.<br><br>Just because you have the emotional capacity of a spoon doesn&#39;t mean any of these people&#39;s experiences are invalid or &quot;whiny&quot;.
aymvX-OrlS0,"Best I can say is if possible, try to do your work in another room out of view.<br><br>There is some degree to be worried. But what is important is that you&#39;re still making time for your child on a regular basis. <br><br>If nothing else, you&#39;re exhibiting a close look at what it means to be busy. Which will translate into working as your child grows. So you&#39;re at least establishing that there is a value for doing these actions called &quot;working&quot;."
aymvX-OrlS0,"reading this comment as i watched that part of the video felt like the hardest punch in the gut...i&#39;m accepting the emotion though, as part of the healing process, &amp; i&#39;m so proud i&#39;m even at a point where i&#39;m not bottling that feeling up anymore after the emotional neglect of my childhood"
aymvX-OrlS0,"@Lapta Kyrenia that actually happened to me, i was so emmotionally detached that as a 9 month old i broke my neck for staring too long at the window, watching the other kids play. outside."
aymvX-OrlS0,"The baby also gives up crying eventually,a switch flicks in the brain,damaged for life"
aymvX-OrlS0,Same
aymvX-OrlS0,It&#39;s natural
aymvX-OrlS0,You could see in the mother&#39;s eyes she was struggling to do it.
aymvX-OrlS0,This is the type of stuff that makes me have faith in humanity. You are so incredibly strong and such an amazing parent for striving to be better than the parent(s) you were given. I wish you and your daughter a happy and healthy life &lt;3
aymvX-OrlS0,"Dam  that&#39;s honest but as a kid who mom did that, I always knew when she had a bad day and to stay out the way ,but that was never good enough it like she looked for reasons to unload on someone and I always knew it would be me or the cat it got to the point I started counting how many times she came home and complained as soon as she walked in ,even when there was legit NOTHING it was everyday( no let up not exaggerating) .. that&#39;s how knew she was crazy but it really stuck with me that&#39;s she so bitter she let me know constantly I was a mistake or I felt it so please if you can get ur help if u love ur kids like u say u do they will one day resent u,  if their hurt in future no matter how many times they bring it up genuinely apologize I use to do everything my mom said WITHOUT a second thought, now she will probably die alone by herself and I won&#39;t give af"
aymvX-OrlS0,I envy you.
aymvX-OrlS0,Try connecting to him if you feel safe
aymvX-OrlS0,"Hope you can respond to him with love and that you find ways to chat together, not always about his mistakes but just about life and love and the whole darn thing."
aymvX-OrlS0,That makes three bb
aymvX-OrlS0,Awareness is the first step for self improvement! Did he change his ways? Is  he trying to be better now? How are you doing?
aymvX-OrlS0,You need to tell your doctor right away. Tell your doctor you are feeling very depressed but I just wanna warn you if you tell your doctor that you’re having thoughts of killing your children they will try and take the kids away
aymvX-OrlS0,And no! It was not  medication or something to help the kid!
aymvX-OrlS0,@Elan P all bright lights are only visible in the darkness!
aymvX-OrlS0,This study would equate to those successful types being very limited
aymvX-OrlS0,That is beautiful! I wish you love and light! Congrats!!
aymvX-OrlS0,@Breanna Maree I was guilt tripped too all the time and it makes me frustrated.
aymvX-OrlS0,Could I ask you when the discarding started?  Was your mother affectionate (regardless of reason) with you until a certain age?
aymvX-OrlS0,My mother would do this &quot;love bomb&quot; me so it would make up for her narcissistic behavior. She would also force me to hug her while she cried so when my friends would try to hug me growing up I hated it! I didn&#39;t know that hugs were supposed to be happy not to be uncomfortable/an emotional guilt trip.. My step mom said it hurt her to see how emotionally distant I was as a child and I was only 8 when she came into my life.
aymvX-OrlS0,Not Verbally expressing love however is not a sign of lack of love. It just depends on upbringing and culture.
aymvX-OrlS0,I so wish this was my family as well. Your friend said it’s weird as a defense from pain that he would feel understanding that it was actually missing from his life.
aymvX-OrlS0,"I love this, I am the same way with my mom. Never had anyone say it was weird but I noticed most people are not like this."
aymvX-OrlS0,"Group hug, group hug.😍🥰💞"
aymvX-OrlS0,Same
aymvX-OrlS0,My mother was and is the least affectionate person I&#39;ve ever known but she showed love in everything she did for my sister&#39;s and I. She&#39;s amazing but she&#39;s never been able to expreas love because she didn&#39;t receive any herself...
aymvX-OrlS0,Me either. My first memory is of my mom giving me a puff of her cigarette when I was 2.
aymvX-OrlS0,Same here
aymvX-OrlS0,Please don&#39;t become the person you hate. They need you. Even if they weren&#39;t the best parents.
aymvX-OrlS0,"It&#39;s saddening, but cheers to you for saving yourself...... I presume this would give the feeling that mom is not gonna do anything incase I&#39;m in trouble."
aymvX-OrlS0,I’m so sorry sweety. I’m very sorry. I feel every word you wrote. I hope one day somehow we all can heal including our parents and the whole earth and this torture will end.
aymvX-OrlS0,Very smart you have learnt how to survive on your own
aymvX-OrlS0,This is horrible. I&#39;m so sorry. 😢
aymvX-OrlS0,Then you play videos like these in his hearing so he knows he had it good.
aymvX-OrlS0,That’s terrible I’m sorry you had to go through that.
aymvX-OrlS0,Do the same thing when she is old and unable to change her own diaper <br><br>Jk jk
aymvX-OrlS0,OMG. I am so sorry.
aymvX-OrlS0,"@June corrigan What do you mean, dear? The daughter  give the abusive father 100% attention? Well, in this case, she is doing it for God and she will certainly be rewarded with a long life and success in everything else. This is the promise!"
aymvX-OrlS0,Or give the abusive father 100% attention.
aymvX-OrlS0,Im sorry you went through that💔. God bless you
aymvX-OrlS0,"same for me. it took me years to come to the same conclusion. And it was an emotional shock to me when I realized it. because i had perfect family and great childhood. i thought i had everything and so my parents. but i did not have my fathers attention or presence for me. I feel like he was always tired, frustrated, overworked, nervous, never took pleasure with spending time with me, or trying to understand me."
aymvX-OrlS0,I can relate to you.
aymvX-OrlS0,@Tracesprite :( thank you
aymvX-OrlS0,"@elf glow Well, you do deserve to be loved and valued. I hope that life goes well for you. Every time you go for a walk or you choose some healthy food or you have some fun and feel happy, please know that you&#39;re doing exactly as I wish for you. Every time that some happiness comes your way, that&#39;s exactly what should happen so you enjoy those precious moments when things feel good. They belong to  you."
aymvX-OrlS0,I had same trauma but with my mom who is a narcissist. And I have same feelings as you and I cannot get rid of it. I wish I could be healthy and feel loved
aymvX-OrlS0,💔💔 stay strong
aymvX-OrlS0,💔
aymvX-OrlS0,"Everyone can be parent, but first they have to heal themselves. <br>just like if you are born with crippled legs, it&#39;s not your fault. <br>But not taking remedial measures will be your fault.<br>Once you have taken supporting aid, then you should walk along with everybody else on the road."
aymvX-OrlS0,@shelby j of course not. but you need more than your parents to read human faces. there are studies out there - much older than corona.
aymvX-OrlS0,Really? you think parents are going to be wearing masks 24/7 around their babies? get a grip.
aymvX-OrlS0,No
aymvX-OrlS0,"It reminds me of when my mom would yell at me and then just stare, expecting an anwser. She would just stop suddenly after asking something like &quot;isn&#39;t that fucked up?&quot; Or &quot;how would you like it if i did it to you&quot; and she would stare. Unblinking. <br><br>Legitimately terrified me because i knew no matter what i did it meant more yelling. <br>Tell her the truth? Piss her off and more yelling.<br>Tell her what she wanted to hear?<br>She would continue her rant and keep yelling. <br>Say nothing? <br>After a few minutes of staring, she would get mad and keep yelling. <br><br>A 3 way no win situation."
aymvX-OrlS0,It actually made me cry &lt;/3
aymvX-OrlS0,I feel like I married a still face man
aymvX-OrlS0,"@Alex A people don&#39;t wear masks in their own home 24/7, and you don&#39;t breathe in your own waste products when you wear a mask or else surgeons and nurses would be dead. stop citing false science just because you&#39;re too selfish to wear a mask."
aymvX-OrlS0,And what of fathers?
aymvX-OrlS0,You are loved.
aymvX-OrlS0,What about father? Studies has proved that they are important to.
aymvX-OrlS0,Yikes.: this comment is probably very triggering for mothers with depression. I’d start to imagine that my child is better off without me… If anyone read this comment and got triggered- you are needed and please seek help so that over time you can get better for your child. Get help from others who may be able to give your child more attention/love until you are stronger and capable of giving that yourself.
aymvX-OrlS0,"I suffer from depression very very severe depression! <br>And the reason I got help for it was because I started to notice a change in my child I was neglecting him so much. Like seriously doing the bare minimum to only keep him alive. but of course not doing it on purpose! It’s very hard to explain, especially if you’re not loving it. (It’s breaking my heart to even write this. And it’s extremely hard for me to write it. I have tears coming down my face.) but I know it’s important for me to share my story….<br>So other women struggling will know they are not alone 😘<br>Sooo anywho,<br><br>I couldn’t keep doing that to him even though it was something that was out of my control. I was still (thank God) aware and in love with him enough to see the damage it was doing to him so no matter what I was aware enough to know that I needed help because I love him more then anything! <br><br>So I got help and I’ve been better for about two years now and he is now the happy spunky kiddo that he was before my depression got horrific/ severe! <br>And better means exactly that better now gone. <br>But better is so much more manageable than nothing at all. <br>Yes, I still struggle with it every day but I have help now. so I’m not projecting it onto him and now he gets the best parts of me! <br>I’m so grateful that I get to see him happy again! 🥰<br>My Honeybee….<br><br><br>Listen, if you guys need help (lady’s in particular!)  please get help! <br>I know it’s hard… but just do it! What will help is look your child in there face and that will help you decide to get help I promise. Or remember how you guys use to be. ♥️<br><br>God Bless you all…. And remember you got this. <br>I’m on the way to church now. Which I haven’t been in 6weeks (just been watching it online from home, which is not the same) when I tell you guys it’s a struggle to even get out of bed sometimes I’m not joking but this morning I made myself do it sometimes you just have to fight through it and now I’m getting ready to walk into the building. <br>Thank you God! <br>I’ll never be “cured” Per se…. but what I can do is pray and manage it and be the best mommy I can be for him. 😇<br><br>OK, well let me get my butt in this church I miss it so much 🙏🏽😇😘😘😘♥️♥️♥️🐷"
aymvX-OrlS0,"Yea depression is what i figured my mom had but didnt understand until i was a teen. After, my mom did admit she was very depressed and was unsure how long when my siblings and i were very little. I am the oldest.  My poor mother lost her first husband in a car wreck. Then her 2nd husband (our father) to his accidental death. When she was probably still pregnant with my brother. Idk that specific detail. I cant imagine the pain she had gone through because i was told that her my dad&#39;s family, or most of them, thought my mom killed him. I can only imagine the loss, pain, and suffering she had gone through for years. She did her best and yes there were times i was angry at her, but my mom did her best to be a mom. Idk how else she could have been better she barely had time to find babysitters for when she was working. I&#39;m thankful her career before she retired was as a high school teacher. Stable hours and weekends and holidays. I don&#39;t remember the bad days as much as i remember all the happy ones. A regular day or holidays. <br>I&#39;ve reassured my mom now as an adult with my own kids that she did he absolute best. I&#39;m jus sorry she didnt have a better support system from her own family. I even re-apologized for the trouble i caused her the few times as a budding teen."
aymvX-OrlS0,"@happy gilmore no but you can help others future parents not messed up their kids, that&#39;s the power of information just because someone is telling their stories doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re looking for judgement maybe a narcissist parent can learn from hearing or maybe not but doesn&#39;t hurt to let people know the new parents or current parents need to do better and stop making excuses but then turn around and tell they kids to do the things wthey dont do, NOTHING is natural If that person doesn&#39;t have children therefore no new future life is affected what you saying is don&#39;t grieve when someone passes, just take everything on the chin but I&#39;m pretty sure s there are things in your life you seen that no matter how hard u try u cant let go so i don&#39;t want to hear yall"
aymvX-OrlS0,I COMPLETELY agree. and I feel that is part of the goal of the mandates.

aymvX-OrlS0,"Oh my God you do understand that 2 minutes isn’t going to kill the baby, generally when you’re a parent you can’t ALWAYS 24/7 all day long make such faces to your baby when interacting with them. The point is to show that a baby IS aware of social interaction, which means they are aware when the mother isn’t responding to them emotionally. This is to demonstrate that a LONG TERM effect of this would have emotional consequences. You don’t understand science lol don’t be a drama queen."
aymvX-OrlS0,"This comment hit so hard for me. My older sister was planned and both my mother and father kept her, but I was unplanned and was left at the hospital the day I was born. I still don’t have a relationship with my parents at all. They still love and talk to my sister every day. I’m 28 about to be 29 and I still haven’t figured out that it wasn’t my fault. It’s hard because I love my sister she’s my best friend but I’m so jealous of her and I know it’s not her fault for what happened. It’s just hard and telling myself all the time I’m good enough is rough. You’re comment made me cry. I’m sorry anyone was made to feel unwanted by the people who are meant to love you the most. You are definitely deserving of love and attention. ❤️❤️"

aymvX-OrlS0,You don&#39;t need to wear masks at home with your nuclear family.
aymvX-OrlS0,L. Ok fair enough. I value any personal experiences over statistics. Thanks
aymvX-OrlS0,"@Broxine Yes. Most communication is non verbal body language. I am hearing impaired. Response means nodding the head, hand gestures, picking the child up. And for those who can hear....speaking soothingly, all which can be done with a mask. It is the NON response that is damaging. I know. I had a mentally ill mother who went zombie-like from time to time and was completely unresponsive. Extremely damaging to child. A mask is laughable by comparison. Give me responsive masked mother over a non responsive mother with no mask any day of the week!!!!~!"
aymvX-OrlS0,L. And you think a mask resembles any visual emotional response? 😄<br>So you think wearing a mask is better than a unresponsive face?🤣🤦‍♂️
aymvX-OrlS0,@Broxine The time at home without a mask would more than offset the brief time being pushed in a buggy. If you live in Canada you would be aware of the harsh winters when baby would see mom wrapped in scarves and toques with only eyes showing for 4 months of the year. And don&#39;t forget other cultures where faces are covered in public. Children seem to do just fine. Remember in the video mom&#39;s face was VISIBLE. The important aspect is it was UNRESPONSIVE. You are confusing the two.
aymvX-OrlS0,L. Yes but MANY wear them pushing their baby trolley and the baby looks directly into a face with a big black hole.<br>Imagine seeing someone like that pushing you arround...

aymvX-OrlS0,"Update: She is 10 month now, I guess we have a good relationship.. she`s in the clingy phase atm, wants to be in my arms all the time, I pick her up every time she cries and wants to be with me. And she laughs when I try to make her laugh, we play together but she also plays on her own.. she crawls really good already and stands freely, soon she will walk. She`s not saying Mama yet. Many times I forget to talk with her, I`m just a quiet person.. till I remember. Every night she falls asleep in my arms because she has a hard time to go to sleep allone, so I cuddle with her, half an hour, an hour, till she is asleep. I try to spent a lot time with her but it also can be exhausting. I look at my phone and she looks away, stares blank or keeps herself occupied. I`m not sure if we did the still face experiment, if she would even react. It scares me, I don`t even want to try."

I&#39;d rather input to be more understanding and validating towards your feelings, but never tolerate any bad actions that come with it.

Especially when you have never known any different.<br>Becoming aware of it doesn&#39;t mean it will no longer mess you up. <br>Blaming others from the past is a normal part of getting over it. <br>And being the scapegoat of a narcissistic family meant I was always blamed for everything. <br>So for me, blaming where blame is due, was an important part of recovery.<br>And about &#39;past is only a memory not reality&#39;. Try telling that to veterans with PTSD.  It&#39;s easy to say that to some kid who&#39;s depressed, or to your neighbour who&#39;s going through a bad divorce etc. Everyones pain and trauma is valid.<br>Providing we have enough self awareness to see the issues that we have.

aymvX-OrlS0,"Don&#39;t hate your mother. You will add more toxicity to your life. Instead, be the person you want to be inspite of your circumstances. You can do it and I encourage you to pursue the life you want to live. You can find strength, courage, hope, and peace in Jesus Christ. He saved me from myself, from depression, an unforgiving heart, harboring hate from the years of sexual abuse I endured.  He can do the same for you! Give her heart over to Jesus! He knows exactly what to do, how to heal you from all the invisible scars! I will never regret the day that I put all of my burdens in His Hands! God bless you on your journey to peace."
aymvX-OrlS0,I loved my parents no matter what they were not hugged neither
aymvX-OrlS0,"Hey stranger,<br>I might not know who you are but I exactly know your pain, because it&#39;s something I&#39;ve gone through.<br>I&#39;m not the best version of myself right now but I&#39;m ready to be one.<br>I can say one thing that I always believe in, you can be absolutely greatful for the things they have done and things they&#39;ve provided and still choose to be angry for making you an emotional orphan.<br>Forgive doesn&#39;t mean you have to forget or mask it like it doesn&#39;t hurt. Admit that it hurts and then move on. Forgive them but you don&#39;t have to act like it didn&#39;t hurt or you had a happy childhood when you were breaking from inside<br>Take care, Buddy"
aymvX-OrlS0,"@Nusaibah Ibraheem excuse me love, don&#39;t &#39;oh please&#39; my situation and circumstances around me growing up. You literally have no idea the pain I&#39;ve gone through and the amount of therapy sessions I&#39;ve had dealing with this sort of stuff. I know many forms of expression when it comes to showing affection or love, I&#39;m not stupid and i can tell when I&#39;m appreciated or not in my household. Also, I&#39;m not the only one who has experienced this, I&#39;m talking on behalf of many asian relatives and friends and my own family as well. Times are changing now slowly but surely and this would be a thing of the past. Like i said, you have no idea what a lot of people go through when it comes to neglect, and you should be extremely grateful for that. Many people are able to rise above it, some people cannot."
aymvX-OrlS0,"Oh please, I hear this a lot. That being Asian, your parents don&#39;t show emotions! This is not what this is referring to. Saying how you feel all the time is not what being attentive and emotionally available is. Different cultures express affection differently. I know many people who can always verbally express their emotions, but that doesn&#39;t in anyway mean they love more. Of course am not directly talking about your experience, because I don&#39;t know what you have been through, may be you really did have neglectful parents. But there is a difference between love and verbal expression of love."
aymvX-OrlS0,Please don&#39;t bring children to this cruel world.
aymvX-OrlS0,@Semper Fidelis your resilience is amazing. How is your relationship with your mum now?
aymvX-OrlS0,@Fulani Empress absolutely!
aymvX-OrlS0,@Olive Oil That&#39;s very sweet of you 😊
aymvX-OrlS0,@Baron Zaebos what you say make sense
aymvX-OrlS0,"I&#39;m not sure if people have kids so their genes will continue, I think it&#39;s more about the eyebrows it raises when a couple decide not to have children. Marriages or relationships can sour if there isn&#39;t a reason to stay together. The child becomes that reason. I know it sounds strange but for many people having a child is easier than not having one and then having to spend the rest of their lives trying to rationalize NOT having one. In other words it&#39;s a bit like saying I give up, I&#39;m just going to do that mindless thing that everyone else does and have a damn kid. <br>It&#39;s like everything else in life. As soon as you analyze it and break it down for what it is, then it becomes less appealing and less of an aspiration."
aymvX-OrlS0,"Exactly. People upset they didn&#39;t get a hug. Its ridiculous. You cant force love, it either happens or it don&#39;t. Shame some of these people didn&#39;t grow up on the street in a box or have to find dinner in a landfill like some kids had to do. As long as actual abuse didn&#39;t happen sounds like they had it made. No wonder society is so messed up"
aymvX-OrlS0,@Aiah Zohar ugh yass we all just inner kids no matter how old
aymvX-OrlS0,"@Ny Ny I LOVE this idea! You mean, a parenting program for adults, true? I&#39;d even volunteer to BE an adult-parent. It&#39;s not like just because you&#39;re an adult you no longer need nurturing or you magically discover the cure for your past traumas."
aymvX-OrlS0,@Aiah Zohar I think there needs to be a mom and dad program like big brother program to reniacte what should have happened  for at least  a year or longer but it would take people emotionally invested
aymvX-OrlS0,Forgive ppl for hurting u! Hurt ppl hurt ppl. And then forgive urself.
aymvX-OrlS0,"it only mess you up till you are unaware of it.

aymvX-OrlS0,Same girl. I’m divorced...
aymvX-OrlS0,@Gi M Thank you and I wish you the same
aymvX-OrlS0,"Julia this sounds like me. They were always emotionally unavailable and it was something that I instinctively picked up on at 4 years old. I wouldn&#39;t tell them when I fell because I felt like I was burdening them with something they could do without, when I got older I fell into a pattern of abusive relationships with older guys and it was this dark embarrassing secret that I couldn&#39;t share with anyone. There was no guidance and my father&#39;s bipolar disorder got worse when they separated so I often felt like he was the child and I was the parent, guiding him and looking out for signs of him deteriorating. Didn&#39;t even realise at the time how difficult it was."
aymvX-OrlS0,Same. I am going through a break up right now. But I won&#39;t give up. I&#39;m trying to grow again and look out for myself and love myself.<br><br>Let&#39;s all start with positive affirmations and try to be aware of the negative voice inside ourselves and try to stop it every time we are aware of it.
aymvX-OrlS0,And i m 34 now... And things don t look very good..
aymvX-OrlS0,"Yes, but it is a comfort to know that except for that one minute, the baby and mother have a wonderful connection.  So many people - maybe not so much now as in earlier times, felt that babies did not need to be talked to, or &#39;indulged&#39; too much. That was a popular theory in the early 1900&#39;s.  Those people then went on to raise babies, so the fact that we have as many good parents as we do now, is somewhat of a miracle."
aymvX-OrlS0,"Jeff Weston    I love that - and it is not an exaggeration. You may do or say something that may seem like a very small thing to you, but it very well can save someone&#39;s life."
aymvX-OrlS0,a  periodt
aymvX-OrlS0,Just like we realizing things can be different they could have thought that too AND if they wasn&#39;t thinking about nothing but popping out babies that even worse cause that means a lot of parents are sheep and they shouldn&#39;t give out rules like the following them
aymvX-OrlS0,And the cycle continues....
aymvX-OrlS0,"@P777e may be he is not emotionally neglected child.thats why he can say that.parents don&#39;t have right to throw their children in living hell.i am living in hell everyday.i can&#39;t commit suicide and I can&#39;t live my <a href=""http://life.my/"">life.my</a> soul pushes me from within and ask every moment to free it from the my <a href=""http://body.my/"">body.my</a> heart is  broken into 1000 pieces and how hard I try I couldn&#39;t join that pieces together.i live every moment like this.isn&#39;t it punishment for me to live like this? Do I deserve this just because my parents have no idea how to love their own child? I can feel that I am not only emotionally damaged but I am intellectually damaged person too.because I can&#39;t think anything other than freeing my soul every moment."
aymvX-OrlS0,"@Sid B I’m sorry but you’re wrong and I think it’s thinking like this which continues the cycle. The older generation aren’t animals who have no feelings, yes their upbringing and environment comes into play, but we all have been given the ability to know right from wrong, we aren’t animals, and can recognise when something is out of order or would hurt our child. Some parents simply don’t care, and say and do things that hurt their children, and if we were ever to bring it up, they’d probably laugh or get very defensive."
aymvX-OrlS0,@screeningmimi thank you I really aspire to be one day 💜
aymvX-OrlS0,"Sadly, most parents do the best they know how.  You will be a more loving parent.   :-)"
aymvX-OrlS0,Same here. Scared kid in 35 yo body. It really is tragic
aymvX-OrlS0,Or maybe try a physiologist
aymvX-OrlS0,I had  a couple of therapists and they were not helpful. I think like most things you need to find a &quot;specialist&quot; that has experience in these types of matters.
aymvX-OrlS0,@Julie Andrews LMAO (not nice to speak ignorance)
aymvX-OrlS0,"I feel your pain, we had a mother who flogged the shit out of us, spoke to us like we weren&#39;t wanted, no kisses hugs etc. It destroyed us until we got away. Our only brother was beaten up badly by her, I was beaten up regularly for pulling her off him. He never once thanked me to this day. There are women out there that should never have children...very sad"
aymvX-OrlS0,@Elizabeth Osborne   It truly IS!  :-)
aymvX-OrlS0,@screeningmimi I know. It&#39;s wonderful! Don&#39;t know whatI would&#39;ve done if I was an adult before the internet came around to teach me things my parents failed to.
aymvX-OrlS0,"I can relate to your dilemma.  While I am older than you, my parents were busy and didn&#39;t have time to show me how to do things, and my &quot;help&quot; merely slowed them down. My mom was shocked that I didn&#39;t know how to cook or do basic household things at 18.  Fortunately now you can learn how to do just about anything in the world on Youtube!   :- )"
aymvX-OrlS0,"it only mess you up till you are unaware of it.

aymvX-OrlS0,@Sandra Swan I read a comment of yours earlier that your mom cried when you told her that hugging her was like hugging a stranger. She showed emotions to you through tears??? My mother would have gotten angry and not cried at all lol
aymvX-OrlS0,Something we must change!
aymvX-OrlS0,👏
aymvX-OrlS0,@nightwalks you didn&#39;t read much then
aymvX-OrlS0,This was real
aymvX-OrlS0,"Past problems only mess you up till you are unaware of it. When you get to know it, it is your own responsibility to cure it.

aymvX-OrlS0,"lucky my mom is co dependant aggressively helpful , guilt-tripping<br><br>and has narc traits. and married a covert narc.<br>and has family history of OCD<br>all 3 of us kids have OCD and are ruined and doomed."
aymvX-OrlS0,I agree.
aymvX-OrlS0,"I strongly feel this. My mothers emotions were off the park because of her mental illness. Her mother died the month before I was born. She rejected me at birth. You definitely start life from a bad point. I am sure I didn&#39;t feel in a safe place in the womb. Those first few moments and weeks and months are building blocks to a secure base. This isn&#39;t something to wallow in negatively because this isn&#39;t productive but you have to work with what you know. You will never convince a man with one leg that he has two. He knows he doesn&#39;t. In the same way you will never convince someone from childhood trauma that its all in the past, &quot;Why let that bother you now&quot; &quot;forget it&quot;, &quot;just move on&quot; because it isn&#39;t that easy. More important than anything is someone who doesn&#39;t judge how you feel but ACCEPTS it, shows you that they care, and even if they don&#39;t have an answer they listen, patiently. BTW, It took me 36 years to not hate my mother. She died before I could show her that I understood what a bad place she was in."
aymvX-OrlS0,Let&#39;s test this theory in a war zone and see how true it is
aymvX-OrlS0,The one from shit logo
aymvX-OrlS0,I can definitely relate and It&#39;s sad because now I don&#39;t have a relationship with my sibling. We don&#39;t communicate at all.
aymvX-OrlS0,Feel the exact same bro the amount of hate I felt as a child from getting beat or whopped for doing little things like acting slightly annoyed towards my mom disagreeing and having it seen as an attitude probably fucked me up hard when it comes to saying how I really feel about things with my words
aymvX-OrlS0,Thank you
aymvX-OrlS0,@Barb Rowley sis this is black people problems don&#39;t tell people what to call themselves
aymvX-OrlS0,@Maria Lopez sometimes someone’s ethnicity matters because some cultures don’t value “spoiling” children
aymvX-OrlS0,So sorry for this.

aymvX-OrlS0,@theKMFDM machine ok.
aymvX-OrlS0,"@Mana Lisa to achieve a even higher state of enlightenment. Like the ancients did. <br>Its fascinating on many levels. <br><br>I think it&#39;s actually a healthy thing for all people to experience. <br><br> These compounds are being used in medicine as a cure for depression and addiction, along with other mental health problems.

Everyone needs to do their own research.  <br>But i can certainly say your opinion is no fact .<br> its all way more complicated than drug use is evil and opens a person up to evil."
aymvX-OrlS0,@theKMFDM machine I&#39;ve done all those and more..much more.. don&#39;t kid yourself. Drugs open portals for demons to enter..
aymvX-OrlS0,My dads aspie and my mom has ptsd (causing severe postpartum depression) I’ve had to reverse engineer why I’m so fucked up because nobody talks to me about my childhood.  (Why I’m watching this) All my memories are distant or of me trying to self soothe playing alone. I can remember in ppk that I would seek affection from teachers not really understanding I was so deprived at home. I have never had any kind of affirmation that what I’m doing is right from my parents just analytical corrections most of my life.  they wonder why I’m distant and bitter. With my answer being “Maybe because you were never around or mentally stable when it was important”. <br><br><br>Anyone else use YouTube comments for therapy?
aymvX-OrlS0,@Ny Ny oh and a bottle fed baby isn&#39;t a messed u9 baby lol
aymvX-OrlS0,"@Ny Ny the bigger version of the babies are the adult and I see plenty of big babies on here..... I am not talking good regarding parents who don&#39;t actually care for their children or who are abusing them out of hatred, or who are leaving the children to other people to grow to then come and shout out they gave birth and was enough....I am talking about parents who are doing their actual best .....read properly or just don&#39;t bother to answer to me ....Oh and I am not messed up neighter talking as if I am mother of the tear....I am literally speaking in a modest enough way to remind you all that you shouldn&#39;t be so ungrateful and judgemental .....Maybe they did try their very best...maybe while having you they also got into nasty depressions or anxieties....maybe they even tried to keep you at a safe place while calming themselves down because that is what they are suppose to do ....maybe they left you for that 5minutes to calm down out if love for you , because the crying you&#39;ve been doing past 3days got the vest if them....maybe they had to earn as well so that the wind won&#39;t blow cold on your behind....maybe they had to cook and clean as well and had no other help ....maybe they had people who would make their lives a hell for not listening to their advices of putting you aside to &quot;learn to calm down yourself or put yourself to sleep&quot;"
aymvX-OrlS0,@Ny Ny your last statement makes no sense...
aymvX-OrlS0,@Ny Ny my children are happy children and you are nobody to speak about them and their future the way you just did ....actually that speaks volumes about yourself ....
aymvX-OrlS0,Same
aymvX-OrlS0,"@vixensvendetta I find your comment disturbingly untruthful.  Survival on our planet is about being connected amongst species (humans, also dogs, wolves, etc). Truly connecting requires respect, honesty, trust, vulnerability, love. Whether it be a baby, a dog, you, me, the prime minister, a plant, etc.<br>We are all surviving Emmy. I never understood why people always think their dog loves them and treat them as if they are &#39; child like&#39;..  They are so utterly intelligent, they can sense every bit of imbalance and weakness in your system, etc,etc.   Dogs and other &#39;pets&#39;,  are not free, but imprisoned by humans in a home. Don&#39;t ever just fill in that its merely love doing the trick.<br>All the best to you"
aymvX-OrlS0,"@vixensvendetta not true at all, babies need love, nurturing, and physical touch. They’re not just creatures who need feeding and changing, they crave love too."
aymvX-OrlS0,"@sushi givesmelife If you watch her face closely you can see she was definitely having a hard time. I could tell from all the blinking. Also, she broke instantly once the baby started crying."
aymvX-OrlS0,Yes! That&#39;s the thing with babies! They don&#39;t understand emotional complexities and defects. All they know is &quot;Mommy doesn&#39;t love me&quot; and it sends them into panic mode.

aymvX-OrlS0,"@FeathersofDxhlia thank you for this, I am not Nigerian but I do have Nigerian friends and they have also expressed this to me. I find it very ignorant that people from other cultures are trying to tell someone what other cultures go through without having done any research. Let’s just stop the gaslighting and have everyone’s concerns be heard."
aymvX-OrlS0,"I understand everyones concern with this comment, but it seems alot of people are talking from outside the experience of being Nigerian. Coming from a biracial Nigerian woman who lived in Nigeria for years, i can confirm that YES this is the culture in Nigeria. Young girls from age 14-22 are strictly forbidden from having boyfriends, my step mum, dad, gran and aunties all preached how sinful it would be to have one and just focus on my books. I&#39;d get in trouble for simply making friends with boys at age 12. All my girlfriends said the same of their family. And once a girl finishes uni, out of nowhere &quot;Where is your boyfriend? When will you finally get married? Dont you want us to have gran children? Your clock is ticking&quot;  Unmarried women In Nigeria in their 20&#39;s and 30&#39;s are constantly pestered by family to &#39;finally settle down&#39;. My step mum was married first before her older sister, and its seen as disappointing if a younger sister gets married before the eldest.<br><br>This isn&#39;t to shame the culture in Nigeria, this is a known fact among us Nigerian millenials and Gen z! We make memes and tik toks poking fun at our parents for their ridiculousness on this topic. The fear stems from a mixture of fearing teen pregnancy and being shunned by society (such as the community you live in, friendship groups and church networks). Alot of boomer and early Gen X Nigerian parents dont understand the importance of socialising teenage boys and girls, they expect them to just hit that age and already have it figured out. We never got the Sex Ed we needed except the biological aspect. Not the emotional side, psychological side, consent, hygiene and most certainly not the pleasure part. <br><br><br>Alot of Nigerian parents of Millenials and Gen Z are old school and reserved, and this comment is not racist or offensive in any way, its an open door to have this conversation and make a change."

aymvX-OrlS0,"@Albert Kirilov It&#39;s really difficult when people have strong views and aren&#39;t welcoming of other opinions.

I&#39;ll have to think about that.&quot; Then I don&#39;t say my own viewpoint so I don&#39;t get attacked. Luckily it&#39;s not really much of a problem among the people I know so that&#39;s lucky for me."
aymvX-OrlS0,"@DW same thoughts. It could be a “breather” too. Cutting parents some slack is also a loving attitude, nice to have going around right?"
aymvX-OrlS0,"@Albert Kirilov That&#39;s so heartbreaking, Albert. If  your mother and father were not interested in you, well, more fools them! You were once a dear little baby and now you are a wonderful person. Please decide to love yourself because you deserve it."
aymvX-OrlS0,@Clarify That&#39;s so awful for you. I hope you can find good friends who make you feel valued and cared for and respected.
aymvX-OrlS0,"@Cristina You sound like you are doing a wonderful job. You&#39;re not the kind of person that is being criticized. There really are people, whether mothers or babysitters, who won&#39;t even look at their child for 30 or 40 minutes at a time. They just remain absolutely focused on their phones, even when the children are trying to get their attention. The saddest part is when the children have given up trying to get their attention and just sit in silence, knowing that no one will attend to them."
aymvX-OrlS0,ergh that hit home because i know that childhood begging. that feeling of helplessness and not being able to do anything about it when you have a parent who just doesn’t care is frustration not like anything else i’ve experienced in my life.

It is a lonely path to go alone and although horrible it feels relieving to meet people who can relate. You mentioned you feel like an orphan. I felt I never really belonged to my family. There was so much distance. I don&#39;t know where this was coming from. Also my little sister physically attacked me my whole childhood. It is interesting you mentioned scratches. Although it is very different as it was your mother I find it still interesting that my sister scratched me so hard in my face that I had scars until I was older."
aymvX-OrlS0,"@m94s18 A93 wow! I left my country too for 12 years. When I came back and faced them for real it was the end cause I couldn&#39;t take it. All the promises, all the affection weren&#39;t real. I had step children for 2 years. I would have done everything for them. Unfortunately my former partner was emotionally abusive and I was suffering a lot in the toxic environment. I miss the children. But also I realize now how in some ways I repeted the same pattern and I struggle to comprehend that realization. Now, accepting and being willing to see and processing through the abuse I suffered I am able to see my own wrongdoings based on imprint through my family and can work on it. It is hard to digest but the only way to healing. As more I embrace and accept myself the more I can accept my family for how they are. It is so sad. I am sorry for all those people having experienced abuse in their life. Somehow all of us did in their own ways. I hope we can find to accept ourselves and surrender to ourselves and life and be curious what is waiting for us. I hope we find peace within and the willingness to reflect. We are all broken in some ways and I wish we all heal."
aymvX-OrlS0,"Omg, I am so sorry."
aymvX-OrlS0,It&#39;s a nightmare.
aymvX-OrlS0,Me ...
aymvX-OrlS0,Connection is important for all of us. Give her sister all the love and attention that you are able. Find ways to look after yourself too. We all need to feel connected and safe. Sending you care and love.
aymvX-OrlS0,"@Syd Cas That&#39;s very kind of you.   I think you are doing the right thing. When we feel like we aren&#39;t being listened to it is hurtful and frustrating. so it has to help her to know that you see what she is feeling.  You are developing what will be a lifelong friendship with her, and someday she will be the one comforting you.  Siblings are a treasure."
aymvX-OrlS0,"@Laura Massa Meyer i mean she’s not a baby anymore, she’s  3 and can speak perfectly but still, she cries about everything so ive been trying to be patient and be there for her"
aymvX-OrlS0,My husband once asked me why i picked up our infant son just to cuddle with him. He wasnt crying. I told my husband if i only pick him up when he is crying he will just learn to cry for attention. I think my mil was one who only paid attention when her son was crying.
aymvX-OrlS0,Always respond to a crying baby. Babies don’t manipulate. Their distress is real and the best way to help your sister grow up to be a healthy adult is to respond to her need for closeness.
aymvX-OrlS0,My mom the same. I spent much of my childhood by myself in a small house in the country. She loved me but had to work day and night.
aymvX-OrlS0,Lol. You sound like me.

Basically all psychology and spirituality agrees that early caregivers matter the absolute most."

aymvX-OrlS0,Story of my life. Im sorry to hear you went through this. Unfortunately it&#39;s a bit comforting to know others have gone through it too.
aymvX-OrlS0,Sounds like a narcissistic parent. Been through there too..
aymvX-OrlS0,"I have high functioning autism and it&#39;s been a blessing to know. Social events are tricky for many, bit for an autistic person sensory exposure can be overwhelming and make you feel clostrophobic. My dad never understood about it and he found it rage inducing to the point he would get aggressive! My mum only really took it inboard in my later teens to early 20&#39;s. In between that I felt unbalanced and free up in a world feeling invisible. Which many may think may seem ok perhaps for someone who has autism, but we still like to be close to those we feel safe with and trust. And to grow up feeling invisible to them, it&#39;s just so hard."
aymvX-OrlS0,Praise Jesus! Amen!
aymvX-OrlS0,"And there you go! It stopped with you. Strong, blessed lady you are..."
aymvX-OrlS0,"May I suggest that you arrange to spend &quot;private time&quot; with your middle child, even if it&#39;s just hanging out with him in your bedroom, or going for a walk.  If his father is present, ask him to do the same.  Do this twice a week for 45 minutes each time, and your son will stop trying to get your attention.  The reward for you will be getting to really know your child.  As a middle child myself, I wish I had had something like this.  My parents kept a roof over my head, and food in my stomach, but knew very little about what I was actually dealing with at any given time.  I try to forgive them, as they had their own very real struggles.  But, now you know how to create a different reality for your child.  All the best."
aymvX-OrlS0,"my dad died 10 yrs ago ,  no chance with my mum have not spoken for 10 yrs she will never admit she was wrong about anything , i did make some head way with my dad before he died"
aymvX-OrlS0,"Same. My relationship with my mother have always felt an on and off due to personality differences. Although she was very empathetic/affectionate, at times my mother took her people pleasing to her friends and even family members over my own emotional needs to a point where I felt like I had no voice…"
aymvX-OrlS0,Nothing to be jealous of because a mother is supposed to be a mother to her children not a friend. Of course a mother is going to love you no matter what sometimes mothers have to have tough love. Maybe she could be your friend later on in life but not while you’re a child she has to be a mother first.
aymvX-OrlS0,@brittney this took me out idk why but it sounds like something I would have said
aymvX-OrlS0,@Georgia Girl that&#39;s always the sad part because there is always that little piece that&#39;s u think she realize the error of her ways even if its just to keep a relationship with herr kids unfortunate..I seen parents work harder to keep a job that would fire them in a heartbeat
aymvX-OrlS0,@dani G. exactly NOTHING wrong with being a mother first and a friend second
aymvX-OrlS0,I was surprised when i saw my friend&#39;s mother called her daily to check what she ate that day and if her day was fine...i was like whaaaaat mothers or anyone dooo tht..  .. lol
aymvX-OrlS0,"@Ligma Lynn I&#39;m not trying to be unsympathetic, but why have you allowed your mother to ruin your relationships? Why do you allow the abuse? You&#39;re an adult now and you don&#39;t have to allow witches and demons into your life. I walked away from my mother after she turned my father against my husband and began trying to get me to side with her against my husband. Her narcissistic games aren&#39;t acceptable. I won&#39;t let her demonic garbage affect my life. I follow Jesus and life is hard enough without embracing demons. Jesus never said to let demons abuse you."
aymvX-OrlS0,"@Robin Luich I&#39;m glad to hear that you had such a loving relationship with your mom.  Did she ignore you when you said &quot;I love you&quot; to her?  Did she recoil at your touch?  When you said you didn&#39;t feel loved did she run away leaving your dad to try and explain how much she loved you?  People don&#39;t just show love in different ways they feel it in different ways as well.  <br>It&#39;s not just that she kept handing me vanilla ice cream and when I liked chocolate ice cream.  I would tell her I liked chocolate ice cream.  I would tell her I didn&#39;t like vanilla.  She would ask what kind of ice cream I wanted and then give me vanilla anyway.  Oh you like chocolate ice cream?!  Is that what you really want?!  Well look I made vanilla ice cream just for you!!!  See how much I love you that I made/got you vanilla ice cream?!  Oh yes, sure mom.  I love it.  Oh nope, sorry-not sure why I thought a hug might be appropriate.   I&#39;m so excited to pretend to be happy while I choke down this vanilla ice cream.  I am fully aware of how upset it would make you if you thought I wasn&#39;t eternally grateful.  So yeah, no big how let down I am, I don&#39;t want to do or say anything to upset you so I&#39;ll just keep it to myself and plaster this smile on my face.  As long as one of us is happy I guess.<br>It&#39;s sickening.<br><br>My mom also showed she loved us by keeping the house in order.  Before I left for college I had never even done my laundry.  Mom, I&#39;m heading off to college tomorrow will you please teach me how to do laundry?  Mom?  Mom?  Really, I don&#39;t know how.  Why can&#39;t you just show me real quick?  Hello?  Where&#39;d you go?<br><br>Do you want to trade moms?  Fair warning, she will admit she never cared about you."
aymvX-OrlS0,"@megan w My mother never used the words I love you, but she showed it ,and that was enough for me. I never seen my mother except on Sunday.<br>My mother was busy working two full time jobs to provide for us and that was her way of saying I love you,and I was perfectly fine with that.<br>I showed her I loved her by keeping up the house and taking care of my little sister."
aymvX-OrlS0,"My mother worked two full time jobs and only had time to come home and sleep. I never felt deprived or not loved. I took care of my 6 year old sister since I was nine,its what family does.  We did all our own cooking, cleaning,and laundry. We were way more independent my children whose rooms I cleaned until they were 24 and blow dried their hair every morning until they were 7th grade and wanted to do their own. <br>I shouldve given them more responsibility."

aymvX-OrlS0,"@RishiFF I went the other way, my parents where terrible, drunk, abusive, and yeah I went off the rails, drugs, jail.<br>But when i found out my misses was preg I decided never to be like my dad.<br>I didn&#39;t quit my lifestyle (far from it lol), but I did raise my kids without the fear of violence and gave them stability. Unlike me they have made it into adulthood without an addiction or a criminal record, 2 things I wish I never had.<br>Take care buddy."
aymvX-OrlS0,"@Isa G If it&#39;s any consolation your not alone. My mother had me accidentally had me but kept me due to her religion and family pressure. I knew she never enjoyed spending time with me or raising me (she eventually gave me to her parents to raise). Her motto was &quot;learn to entertain yourself&quot; which I did like you by escaping into myself but maybe not quite as extreme as your case. I hope realize that real love does exist, even if your unable to recognize it, which is first step toward having it."
aymvX-OrlS0,"@LD JD Thank u so much! <br>Of course it&#39;s a consolation. Such compassionate people like u are the reason why I&#39;m still on this planet. Shows me the bright side of life :)<br>Have a nice day, feel loved."

aymvX-OrlS0,Laura Ma - Why would anyone ever think love is a luxury?
aymvX-OrlS0,@Daks i think classes for parents to be would be a perfect solution. That&#39;s a really creative and smart solution actually.
aymvX-OrlS0,"@Kt Qt @Hilde Renshof You both are absolutely right in the fact that if it&#39;s not done properly, it will definitely lead to a totalitarian regime to the point of forced sterilisation. I just wished that when someone is expecting a child, they at the very least, need to take childcare classes (which I know already exist) and a quick safety check of their environment. I just hope we can somehow come up with an idea to make it less likely for children to be born in horrible situations. It&#39;s sadly something that will never go away despite how much we try to prevent such things."
aymvX-OrlS0,"I totally agree. As a teen mom ppl say i am a bad mother before they even talked to me. It&#39;s really diffecult to try your best to proof everyone wrong and raise an independent and  respectful young man while some mother&#39;s are litteraly f*cking their children up. The emotional and  psychological abuse that they use on their children..... But no one looks at them, no one questions them or thinks that they are bad mother&#39;s..... Yet here I am, i hear from every person who knows me, and every healthcare worker (my son was born prematurely so he needed a little assistance for a longer period of time by doctors) say that I am doing everything exactly right. That everything is going great and that he is developing healthily. Yet I am the one who gets hate and told i am a bad mother by complete strangers and ppl who barely know me. But the actual abusive mom&#39;s run around freely. But the reason some form of testing to see if someone is deemed as able to raise a child isn&#39;t really possible, is the ethics behind this. If someone isn&#39;t deemed as able to raise a child. What would happen? Sterilisation? Forcing them to use the pill or condoms the rest of their life&#39;s? Forced abortions? There is no way that such kind of testing would be deemed as ethical. Plus, where do they draw the line? When are you good enough? This is something that&#39;s not measurable, it are all opinions. But i wish there was... It would definitely half all the crime rates too, because most criminals come from abusive or neglective families."
aymvX-OrlS0,@Daks Adoption is much different than a biological family. Children are statistically much safer with their biological parents than with unrelated adults (especially mommy’s boyfriends).
aymvX-OrlS0,"@Daks the only problem is there is no way to ethically regulate a system like that. Reproduction is a natural biological function, it would be impossible to enforce something like this in a way that isn’t straight out of an authoritarian dystopia"

aymvX-OrlS0,"My daughter is the same with my grandkids. You don&#39;t ignore or be mean to your kids and then wonder why as adults they don&#39;t feel close to you. Too little, too late. I always thought to myself as a child that at least I know how to not parent. I was a great mom and grandmother.  I wish I could say the same for my daughter.  Some people like the idea of having children because it is a source of never ending love. The reality is that children are work.  You must supply that love to have it returned."

With the parents we have had there is no bonding.  How cute we possibly feel anything?  If I could just say, the less time you spend with her and that includes the phone, the better you will feel.  Good I’d luck👍"
aymvX-OrlS0,"My mother is 90 and I am 62.  She was and is a malignant narcissist.  I will not be at ease until she dies.  Sounds harsh, huh?  I shudder when I see her name on the caller ID on my phone.  I’ve been in therapy for 40 years, and I’m on 3 different antidepressants.  I’m fairly functional and I am and have been an attentive and emotionally available parent to the best of my ability, though I had no good role model except my grandmother, who was so kind and loving to me.  She was a major depressive.  People tell me it’s in the past, but they’re wrong.  Every time I have a phone call with my mother, she ignores me on the phone just as she did when I was a child.  She talks “at me” for an hour or so, not allowing me a word in edgewise.  My father was a really bad alcoholic, and emotionally unavailable.  He apologized to me in his 80’s, and died a few years later.  I feel damaged, and I struggle every day with my insecurities and depression."

aymvX-OrlS0,One book to try to be more present is Running on Empty by Jonis Webb and it&#39;s sequel book! It is very informative in how to overcome emotional neglect as well as how to overcome it as a parent and be more attentive!

aymvX-OrlS0,@G W thank you❣
aymvX-OrlS0,"@Lily Elliot &quot;autistics are the most empathetic people&quot; you didn&#39;t include yourself in this, so its a general statement. So you are, why not just say that about yourself, why lump others into it? I can also tell my experience with other autistic people from being in special ed for the same symptoms (not as severe, they couldn&#39;t begin to function in society) as them and we were very different in how we expressed it. Im undiagnosed but from my experience with the diagnosised even they amongst themselves were different. One lets say his name was &quot;ben&quot; was very reclusive and detached then another anonymously named &quot;Tyler&quot; who loved to atleast try to socially interact, he would fail at maintaining it but at leasted tried in comparison to Ben who focused on himself and his passions. Now is this difference an accountance of the autism. Well if autism has now become the very definition of a person&#39;s identity and personality then youd be correct in that I&#39;m wrong. But if autism is a developmental disorder in that of itself, is relyed on the crucial word &quot;development&quot; then austism within itself is a gage of how hindered development is in a person. Thus these things are symptoms of something outside of autism, like trauma that leads to depression based on emotion neglect and social ostracization for example. Then that is my position, I listed austism not in that Im unempathectic but because I have other key symptoms that leads me to suspect I have it. Do you see the difference? The argument is how does autism effect how these things come into being within a person (ie. Austism can be a catalyst through its negative effects to lead to....) such is what my past comment was about.<br><br>Article about lack of emphathy in &quot;some&quot; autistics:<br><a href=""https://www.verywellhealth.com/do-people-with-autism-lack-empathy-259887"">https://www.verywellhealth.com/do-people-with-autism-lack-empathy-259887</a>"
aymvX-OrlS0,@Decimus Stark I&#39;m autistic.
aymvX-OrlS0,"@G W I grew up dirt poor. I had an alcoholic, drug addicted, textbook narcissistic mother who liked to break things and a mostly absent father who was mentally and physically abusive when he was around. I lived in a 2 bedroom apt with 6 adults (up to 8 at times) all alcoholic and drug addicted and 4 kids(myself, my little brother and my 2 cousins) and 7 animals. Me and the other kids slept on the floor of the livingroom.<br><br> I was neglected and abused in every sense of the word. To this day if I hear a door slam or loud music my heart starts pounding and I get jumpy and anxious. I have PTSD and terrible anxiety and panic attacks from the stuff I went thru. I wish I only suffered from lack of love but it was much worse.<br><br> I dont blame my failures on my childhood, only my mental state. I&#39;m much better off financially and physically but mentally not so much and I can attribute that to my childhood. Like I said before it never really bothered me until my 30s, which is common for children of narcissists I learned. <br><br>I hate talking about my childhood because I dont want pity so I usually dont. Very few ppl outside of my family know the details or that I even had a bad childhood and everyone else dont know anything."

aymvX-OrlS0,"@June Chang when I was very young, Mum&#39;s visitors would compliment her about having a pretty daughter. But instead of being flattered, Mum would smirk and say &quot;oh yeah, she&#39;s pretty alright but she&#39;s stupid&quot;. I am now in my 30s but those words still cut. I have never met a Mum who was not flattered about having a pretty daughter. I recently found out that my Dad stole money from his employer when I was about 9 years old, they were gonna put him in prison. He went to my Grandpa (his Dad) and asked for help. Grandpa apparently was in tears when he withdrew the money to give to my father, because he was saving that money for my education. He wanted me to become a Doctor. Because of my childhood experiences, I chose to study Psychiatry, partly to understand why my parents behaved the way they did. I now concluded that my Dad was very likely a Narcissist, possibly with episodes of Psychotic depression.  Kudos to you June Lee for being a survivor. (Hugs) from Oz."
aymvX-OrlS0,"Wow, same story like me. My mom always calls me stupid almost everyday.The only time she called me by my name when there was is a visitor visiting the family. Out of my siblings, I was the one she hurted the most because I was the oldest. Now, I am the most successful person in my family. My other siblings still live with my parents. I got married, have kids, own a great house, have a great job and even own a business. My parents are close to retirement age, are poor and needed financial help because they don’t know how to manage their money. Growing up, I had a bad childhood, but learned to be strong and became successful in life."
aymvX-OrlS0,"@flannel pillowcase it was called emotional manipulation.  I eventually stopped talking to them for 6 years, but my brother convinced me to reconcile by making me feel guilty.  Something about honoring your parents in the bible apparently.  As far as I&#39;m concerned,  a parent deserves to be honored if they do the right thing first by their children. I should have kept my distance.  In any case, no one can guilty me with anything nowadays. Thank you for the reply."

aymvX-OrlS0,"You were meant to be a parent, you can always do better and it’s never too late to turn it around! Be happy and secure with your relationships, and show the love and compassion towards your son that you would want for yourself"
aymvX-OrlS0,"It&#39;s also about the heart energy. Babies read and feel that most. Your baby know you love them. Don&#39;t be hard on yourself, there&#39;s a reason we parents all share the same story of exhaustion. Do your best, love yourself and show your child Love and you will be perfect!"
aymvX-OrlS0,"I hope you will see this:  Ask for help.  Is there another mom in your neighborhood that you would trust to watch your child for an afternoon while you take a nap?  A friend who has been quarantining and would come in and hold your baby while you rest?  A kindly older neighbor?  I have found that many people are happy to help once they learn what you need.  Yes, the pandemic has definitely made things more complicated, but for your mental and physical health, and the well-being of your child, try to find a way."

aymvX-OrlS0,right. idek how to respond to affectionate conversations like
aymvX-OrlS0,@Moth’s MummyI&#39;m sorry you had to go through this and for all of us who had these unfortunate childhoods.  It does stick with us even when working on it. I was in my early 40&#39;s and it was right before my mom died and I don&#39;t remember what was said but she lashed out loudly and emphatically and said &quot;oh go on you all had beautiful childhoods&quot;.  It occurred to me later that compared to her childhood it probably was beautiful.  <br><br>She grew up during the depression and both of her parents were dead by the time she was 11.  She was one of 14 kids.  I think she was traumatized by her childhood and would never talk about it and would let you know not to ask.  She had serious mental health issues and scared the hell out of me as a kid.  I think she was undiagnosed borderline PD.  <br><br>So I think compared to her my seriously dysfunctional childhood with an alcoholic father and her for a mother was better.  It&#39;s all relative.
aymvX-OrlS0,"@Geoffrey Sonnen I know you already declined to the book writing but I would defenatly buy &amp; read it if you ever did... I cannot believe you remember when you were a baby, I remember snipbits of as young as idk 4 years old and when I tell my family they ask me if I&#39;m sure it wasnt a dream 🙄 😒 sometimes I even think I might be crazy or someone else might of told me a story and turned it to fit me 🤷‍♀️ but at the same time I think why would a little girl lie about being sexually abused? or being locked in the bathroom by neighbors my mom would leave me with?.. it&#39;s funny when I was like 14-15 I use to think how tragic my life was and that I should write a book one day but then I meet people and read these comments of people that have been through so much and prevailed and came out stronger.. and I feel like I was actually kind of lucky (I&#39;ve never been homeless or in foster care and I have a husband now and 2 beautiful healthy kids) but I just wish you the best may God bless you and guide you, you sound like you have a good head on your shoulders 🙏"
aymvX-OrlS0,"@Brian Walsh You&#39;re so right, Brian. i made some good decisions not too long after i went out into the world on my own, even laying out an international newsletter for a step program that dealt with psychological issues and addictions. And i was involved with particular reading groups and ones that were supplemental groups for those going to step programs. It&#39;s a two-edged sword though. i may have gotten educated regarding my own thought processes and feelings, it&#39;s the keen observance of others who have no grasp on even basic principles of cause and effect or are immersed in deeply set denial that can be brutally frustrating! When you see them &quot;walking wounded&quot; and not taking any steps to make their lives better (as well as those in close association with them), any words of direction you can give falls on deaf ears. <br><br>Anyway, Brian, i&#39;ve been dealing with the depression caused by current events. Really, i think most of us are going through this to one degree or another. My sleep cycle has been affected by my brain constantly trying to figure out the world, the way people think and behave these days. If COVID were simply a test, the U.S. has flunked miserably! And then there&#39;s the cult mentality that has taken my attention for the last 4 years. And on top of things, there&#39;s my own personal situations, so it&#39;s been just so much that it has interfered somewhat with certain goals, mainly success musically. Writing a book at this point seems like a huge task considering all of this, but i truly appreciate your encouragement and prompt, Brian. Hoping you&#39;re doing well despite all we&#39;ve been dealing with recently!"
aymvX-OrlS0,@Geoffrey Sonnen Do it.  Write a book and get it out.  I&#39;m thinking of doing the same.  There are so many of us suffering from trauma and neglect in our childhoods.  Most of the issues in the world come from people who had less than nurturing childhoods and are now the walking wounded trying to use all sorts of things to numb the pain.

Always crying, inconsolable, so needy and easily frightened. &quot;Stop crying, or more spanking and something to cry about.&quot;. So I learned to stuff my feelings, to avoid corporal punishment. The consequences for me were emotional blind spots;  <br>  I had a genetic thing, an overactive amygdala.  My grandmother passed it on to my dad and I passed it on to my daughter. Fortunately, I was able to get help for my daughter when she was a baby and she&#39;s doing well as an adult.  It only becomes a really bad situation, a double slam,  when the caregivers can&#39;t provide the required positive nurturing environment, to offset the natural abnormality."

aymvX-OrlS0,"@ApostateJim <br>As far as I&#39;m concerned the human race is overrated. We&#39;re just not as important to this universe as we&#39;d like to think that we are. As a matter of fact if the human being were to ever become extinct neither the universe that we find ourselves in nor the planet that we find ourselves on would be any the worse for it. Indeed, the earth could only be the better for our extinction. Look at what we continue to do to it. A methodical progressive wholesale destruction of it.

aymvX-OrlS0,Dam that’s a perfect way to put it
aymvX-OrlS0,"@Joseph Andrews I gave up trying to be normal a long time ago. I can go to therapy and do all the things they say to do but the damage done is permanent. All I can do is accept it and try to manage it the best I can. Some days are better than others. Even with all the mental health help I&#39;ve had (therapy, TMS, ketamine, etc) I still sometimes go to a very dark place and think it would be easier just to say fuck it, I&#39;m done struggling."
aymvX-OrlS0,Fuckin aye. Relentless in the search for affecting change so I can be “normal” and it isn’t gonna come. Scarred for life.
aymvX-OrlS0,So true. I feel like I am in a prison.
aymvX-OrlS0,Hi! I live in Sweden but I want to say that I totally agree.👍  I think he is a disaster. 😒😔
aymvX-OrlS0,"Oh My God, this is amazing and my passionate feelings too!   I&#39;m so sorry for your trauma.  <br><br>I will never understand how good couples have to jump through so many hoops to adopt to protect the child, but when it&#39;s the biological parents and not the adoptive parents, the rights stay with the parents rather than the health of the child i.e. it&#39;s a human right to have a child."
aymvX-OrlS0,"Yes, I agree, growing up my mom would say something similar with regard to parenting: &quot;a person chooses to have kids, they don&#39;t choose to be born, therefore it&#39;s your obligation to be the best parent that you can possibly be&quot;. If you can&#39;t be a good parent then don&#39;t have kids at all, it&#39;s that simple. We make people pass tests and give licenses before we allow them to do all kinds of things, such as driving, attending college, becoming a citizen, etc, but when it comes to child rearing, the most important thing that we could ever do, we allow everyone and anyone to reproduce indiscriminately. Is it any wonder we have so many problems in the world?"
aymvX-OrlS0,Me too
aymvX-OrlS0,I skipped over the experiment - couldn&#39;t watch it.
aymvX-OrlS0,They absolutely have a choice! We (us as souls) have all choosen our lives our parents and the major events that happen to us through out our life. It’s 100 times harder than we anticipated but the lessons we learn here are for us to grow and learn
aymvX-OrlS0,@G4LCTC no you&#39;re right.
aymvX-OrlS0,@LadyWatchingBird I assure you I am not perfect.
aymvX-OrlS0,@LadyWatchingBird at least now you have options
aymvX-OrlS0,"@John Edmunds well, the idea is to stay on this planet for her."
aymvX-OrlS0,@LadyWatchingBird I&#39;ll take her.
aymvX-OrlS0,"Darren I understand how you feel.  I grew up with 7 brothers and sisters, with two parents who never matured enough to offer us emotional support.  Add to that the fact that my father worked retail and could never pay the rent longer than a year before we got evicted and had to move and therefore I was never in one place long enough to make lasting friendships.  I grew up all through adulthood feeling so different and not being able to relate to others.  Long story short, I had dysfunctional relationships and ended up marrying my girlfriend (one of the only girls to show a lasting interest in me) because she was pregnant.  Now, looking back after 23 years and 3 kids, even though I tried so hard to be a good husband and father, I feel like I was never able to give my kids the emotional support they needed and make that connection.  Now that they&#39;re grown I see the effects.  That&#39;s why I clicked on this video.<br><br>I have a brother like you who had a wife (only because she was just as prone to social avoidance as he was) but she died and they had no children.  Now he just sits in his apartment (literally) all day, every day, and I wonder if that would have been me had I not had my girlfriend (wife).  I&#39;ve reached out to him but the saying is true, &quot;You can&#39;t help those who don&#39;t want to be  helped!&quot; <br><br>I came to know Jesus when I was 25 but He never promised to remove the struggles of this world, only that he would be with us, and it HAS been a struggle for me.  I hear what you&#39;re saying my friend and my heart goes out to you.  But I&#39;ve learned several things along the way;<br>1.  You&#39;re not alone!  Many people feel just like you do.<br>2.  NOBODY has it &quot;together.&quot;  I guarantee it!  How many times have we heard of someone famous, wealthy, &quot;successful&quot;, and/or someone who we thought &quot;had everything&quot; and &quot;everyone liked them&quot; only to find out that they were people of low characer or that they were secretly suffering with depressions and doubts and took their own life?  <br>3.  There are people EVERYwhere who could use SOMEthing you can do; a kind word, an extra dollar, whatever YOU have to give. And when we start focusing outside of ourselves on others and sharing each others burdens, it brings true joy.<br><br>The bible says in Proverbs <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aymvX-OrlS0&amp;t=11m25s"">11:25</a> &quot;Be generous, and you will be prosperous. Help others, and you will be helped.&quot;<br>Tha&#39;ts how God designed us.<br><br>I don&#39;t mean to preach at you I just wanted to share a word of encouragement that you are NOT alone; God SEES you and KNOWS! <br>And yes, YOU can reach out and help someone, somehow!  <br><br>I have some encouraging tales to tell but I don&#39;t want this post too be to long.  Here&#39;s a video that illustrates what I&#39;m talking about. I hope you will watch it.<br><br>Blessings!<br><a href=""https://youtu.be/bzmWqZS1QSU"">https://youtu.be/bzmWqZS1QSU</a>"

aymvX-OrlS0,@blacbeuti 🤷🏽‍♀️
aymvX-OrlS0,"@Pat I&#39;m glad you brought up your faith, as the sacrifice of Christ on the cross is a shining example of exactly what I have been getting at.  In Christian theology, everyone has sinned.  Sin, in itself, is just another name for committing a crime against God by not following his laws. The price for that wrongdoing  must be paid.  Since God desires to forgive you, the only way for him to do this is to pay the price in your place. This is exactly what Christ&#39;s sacrifice is.  God paying the price for your crimes (and everyone else&#39;s) by being punished in your place; but this forgiveness is only offered, if you believe in Christ,  are willing to admit that you are a sinner and if you repent.  Only then, are you forgiven. This process of forgiveness is the very foundation of Christianity.   (Sorry to preach, but you did bring up religion.)<br><br>When you forgive someone, you are doing exactly the same thing, paying the price for their wrongdoing, so they don&#39;t have to pay that price themselves.  And, just as in the Biblical story, you should never do this, if the person won&#39;t even admit that what they did was wrong.   When you forgive someone, YOU pay the price for what they did.  Generally, abusers need to be held accountable for their actions, not to be given a &quot;get out of jail free&quot; card.   <br><br>Should you let go of emotional pain?   Absolutely.  Should you stop blaming people and take responsibility for your life?   Definitely.   Should you set clear boundaries on the kind of behaviour you are willing to accept in those around you?  For sure.   Should you hold people accountable for the choices they have made and the things they have done?  I would argue that the answer to that is also a definite yes."
aymvX-OrlS0,@Vincent P I don&#39;t see forgiveness as paying the price for someone&#39;s wrong doing at all. To me forgiveness   is to understand completely why the abuser or anyone who hurts me harmed me in the first place. Forgiveness is giving them grace. They are imperfect human beings. Flawed. No one is perfect.  The cycle of abuse continues for most people unless they are  taught differently. Have you ever done something you regret or hurt someone&#39;s feelings? So have I. Who are you going to blame for the abuse? My dad was beat worse than I was. He was taken out in the back of the wood shed. He was in WWII. Kids were taught to not talk back to their parents. Seen and not heard. Should I blame my father or my grandfather?  Or my great grandfather?  I forgive both of my parents who abused me. I love both of them for what positives they did give me. I would not be the person I am.  Maybe that&#39;s the difference between my ability to forgive my parents because they did have a positive side. I knew they loved me despite the abuse. I could go on and on but it&#39;s getting late. I just don&#39;t know how anyone can get through life without forgiveness. I told my dad as he laid in his coffin I forgave him. He was no longer the strong huge man he was. My mother is 89. I told her I forgave her because I was not the greatest parent. We all make mistakes. Maybe it&#39;s because I do have a relationship with Jesus Christ.
aymvX-OrlS0,"​@PatIt looks like you might be mixing up forgiveness with letting go.  These are not the same thing.   Forgiveness is about paying the price for someone else&#39;s wrongdoing, (meaning you pay the price for what they did, while they get away with it).  <br><br>Victims struggle with forgiving their abuser, because it&#39;s not what the victim needs.  If a person has done something wrong, like abusing their children, they need to be held accountable for their actions. They need to pay the price for their own wrongdoing, not have someone else pay it for them.  Forgiveness is exactly what keeps people in abusive situations in the first place; remember that &quot;reconciliation&quot; is part of the abuse cycle.  These situations only end when the abuse cycle is broken;  this happens when the victim stops forgiving, puts their foot down and forces the abuser to face the consequences of what they did.  It&#39;s no different after the &quot;physical&quot; situation ends.  If the same process isn&#39;t followed, the cycle can continue long after the abuser is no long physically present, with all the hurtful words and actions echoing in the victims head, potentially for decades. It&#39;s okay not to forgive someone who did you wrong, in fact, it&#39;s better not to.  Forgiveness benefits the abuser, not the victim.<br><br>Letting go, though, is certainly something you should do, and I agree with you totally on that one, because letting go is all about releasing what you feel about your abuser, taking away any power they have over you, and permanently getting that person out of your head."
aymvX-OrlS0,"@Vincent P I don&#39;t understand your reasoning at all.  What if the abusers are dead? You forgive them for yourselves. Regardless of what they do or don&#39;t do. Or if you ever talk to them again or not. It&#39;s for your own peace of mind and so you don&#39;t have to feel victimized the rest of your life. I&#39;m responsible for my own feelings and actions. If I want to have healthy relationships I need to take responsibility for my actions.  I don&#39;t want to dwell on negativity anymore. I can&#39;t keep blaming my effed up childhood on what is happening in my life today that will get me no where. That&#39;s My process No one else&#39;s.  I&#39;m done with the anger, resentment, bitterness and self pity.  I&#39;ve been through the whole she bang. I&#39;ve seen a billion counselors and read all the self help books and worked through my feeings.  There comes a time to not focus on the past but look forward towards the future.  To be with my wonderful grandkids. To enjoy life today! I&#39;ve only been able to do this through God and forgiveness. That&#39;s it you do you!"
aymvX-OrlS0,@LolaBandola thanks :)
aymvX-OrlS0,Hello! ☺ That was a touching story and also intresting. I guess that you are suffering. I was too. In my country I found a very good therapy group. Maybe there is where you live too. I would love to tell you more. 👍💜🇸🇪💜🤗

It doesn&#39;t take away from the fact that you should have gotten the love and care that you needed, but I hope that knowing it wasn&#39;t because of you helped a bit. Keep at it with therapy!

aymvX-OrlS0,"I highly recommend videos on attachment style by Thais Gibson (Personal Development School channel).

aymvX-OrlS0,I couldnt breathe from a food allergy and asked to be taken to the hospital. She said serves me right. My dad on the other hand jumped out of bed and took me straight there
aymvX-OrlS0,I’m sorry you had to go through that. If I was your mother I would hold you in my arms and tell you how much I love you. Jesus loves you very much.
aymvX-OrlS0,That explains a lot about my grandparents and their inabilities. And also their casual drug dependences and callousness.
aymvX-OrlS0,"And then those ppl had kids and passed it on to their kids and the next. Truthfully you don’t know, until you do. Unfortunately there were no manuals for parenting back then and many thought that they were doing good by providing food clothing and shelter. I remember being very poor in my childhood and bullied because of it. So when it came time for me to have children I just wanted to make sure that they didn’t experience what I had as a child. I was a single parent and worked very hard to provide, sometimes multiple jobs, but I didn’t realize that I was neglecting my children by doing so. Sure, we went on trips and had fabulous fun, but as I sit down and think, it makes me feel depressed because I didn’t give them the emotional support that they needed. I thought it was fine, until I didn’t..."

For minors, if the IRB approves of the methods and post treatments in the study proposal, then the guardian can give consent for the minor to participate. <br><br>In response to your comment regarding professionalism: scientific discourse and discussion are a part of the scientific field. If we never shared our perspectives and experiences, we would all still believe the Earth was the center of the universe and that gender is a distinct binary. That&#39;s the beauty of communication."
aymvX-OrlS0,"@Kiterpuss There was no consent, so it was unethical. And if you want to be professional, avoid personal comments."
aymvX-OrlS0,"@Shelagh McKenna You strike me as someone who has never conducted formal research before. There&#39;s an entire committee dedicated to establishing the costs and benefits of any study. If they determine something is unethical it cannot happen. Clearly, this brief period of stony face wasn&#39;t going to be damaging to the baby."
aymvX-OrlS0,"Well, no. She should have listened to her heart. How much did she get paid for doing that? How much would it benefit her child later on?"
aymvX-OrlS0,"You gotta see the bigger picture here. With the knowledge derived from this experiment, our understanding of how to raise children has improved, and more and more parents will be aware of the consequences of neglect. The kid may have suffered a little bit but this little sacrifice was done to alleviate the sufferings of many others"
aymvX-OrlS0,That was the childhood for some though!
aymvX-OrlS0,Rana Nuito GOOD u go relax let people b
aymvX-OrlS0,Aww i’m sorry you’re so pretty and shouldn’t be saying this about her but sadly she’s this way and there’s so much love in your heart :( ❤️😊
aymvX-OrlS0,"Yeah, disordered parents tend to have disordered kids."
aymvX-OrlS0,"Maybe people should stop showing up st the border like that.  But, do you have any idea how much child sex and human trafficking has been going on?  If you live in Tucson you would know.  The msm doesn’t talk about it.  And it’s been going on for decades."
aymvX-OrlS0,"@Recycled Soul that&#39;s just it, they don&#39;t."
aymvX-OrlS0,Stephanie S I don’t really understand why people have kids. <br>Or if they even put any thought into it.
aymvX-OrlS0,"@Luna Blué Thank you for the comment. I have an open mind towards god or something higher, although I wouldn&#39;t call myself religious, but sadly I&#39;ve encountered so much falseness and hypocrisy within the church at here, but I have nothing against the god it&#39;s more of the people who doesn&#39;t live according to the word they preach.. Thanks Luna, take care!"
aymvX-OrlS0,I&#39;m trying to seek God  to heal from my parents who abandoned me. I LUV U X
aymvX-OrlS0,and thank God for you Katelyn
aymvX-OrlS0,"Thank❤️ for summarising &#39;Me&#39; &amp; what I need to do , I&#39;m 48 ne t week and &#39;still&#39; pine for a mother and father that never have nor never will exist,,,,"
aymvX-OrlS0,Put this in front of the condom aisle
aymvX-OrlS0,Some people shouldn’t have children.
aymvX-OrlS0,True; we also need to appreciate that such thought is only a recent phenomenon.<br>Think about when birth control wasn&#39;t there... The only thing you could manage to worry about was how to feed your 10 children and keep them from dying on you of disease 🙃<br>This is still the case in poor countries...
aymvX-OrlS0,"I don&#39;t mind when people like the act of making children, but if they decide to have a child, they should be well prepared of the responsibility and obligations that comes with them, but alot of the time, that&#39;s not the case."
aymvX-OrlS0,@zzevonplant be very careful wording your statement and judging other people.<br>I would rather bite my tongue than implying wrong judgement. one day you may end up on the other side of the wall.
aymvX-OrlS0,"Good for you, @SaRiah Robinson. Keep up the good work."
aymvX-OrlS0,"but times of emergent correction, like playing near the street or hitting, i use the firm tone, direct eye with flat face or scared face.<br>its been work."
aymvX-OrlS0,right!  i utilized what i learned from this to intentionally smile in the a.m. teaching them routine. also when i listen to them i make them look me in the eye and i smile at them. lately i included smiling during corrective convo with them. i use hand touch and hi five a lot too.
aymvX-OrlS0,@Luna Blué thank you my dear. We really need a lots of prayers. ❤
aymvX-OrlS0,"Reading this just broke my heart😢😢😢,, I gonna Pray in the hope that there is a God and he&#39;s listening, I&#39;m so sorry"
aymvX-OrlS0,"@Linda your welcome , we are all brothers and sisters and should help each other .   anything by john bowlby  is good  (attachment theory)  and there is  &#39;they f**k you up&#39;  by oliver james  but thats heavy going ."
aymvX-OrlS0,NOT SURE thank you for you books recommendations and comment.
aymvX-OrlS0,"2 books which helped me a lot were &#39; a new primal scream &#39; by arthur janov  and &#39;broken children grown up pain&#39; by paul hegstrom  ,  you have to replace the &#39;script&#39; in your sub-concious mind , which at the moment is saying &#39;im no good &#39;, with a script which says &#39; I am a decent human being ,  i am good enough as i am and i dont have to prove myself to anyone &#39;   basically raising your self esteem , which is not confidence....i mistook self esteem for confidence for many years so did loads of confidence building things ."
aymvX-OrlS0,Only if you want to be. Its about survival. Overcoming obstacles by Gods good grace and mercy. This is why we stand as conquerors.
aymvX-OrlS0,"My mother, who was a narcissist, prided herself on staying at home &quot;for her children&quot; and did nothing. But still, I agree with you. My sisters and I could not be saved from our mother&#39;s hypocrisy - she was adept at her game and fooled a lot of people - but of course if mothers are any good at all they should be with their children. Scary what the world is coming to."
aymvX-OrlS0,Yes it does!  I have always known this since I was a child and most moms were working.  I used to babysit a lot and the best kids were the ones with the stay at home moms.  But there were good kids who had working moms too... they were very loving and happy working moms.
aymvX-OrlS0,"i too believe this! i am mother of 7. i viewed this video vhs in 2000 from a parenting class before i had my 1st baby. i cherished what i learned and have developed a more consistent interaction practice with my other children since then. <br>i was an at home mom 5 years. HUGE!! <br>My husband is learning better methods of engagement, support and discipline with our children. been uphill but he is aware of the health! they all hug and brief convo with him daily, almost. i hope more of us plan ways to prepare for parenting! love up!"
aymvX-OrlS0,U speak my life thru ur words
aymvX-OrlS0,@Ankur Srivastava definitely right! When I stopped victim blaming my mind and heart started healing. Holding onto the negative thoughts won’t bring about change and further more it’ll attract the same energy.
aymvX-OrlS0,"it only mess you up till you are unaware of it. When you get to know it, it is your own responsibility to cure it. Stop blaming people in your past because it is not useful to you today. Make yourself happy today on your own.<br>Just like you may be born with a genetic disease, so you have to take remedial measures.<br>And you are not special, everybody has a different problem of this category. <br>Buck up !! <br>&quot;Replace your memories&quot;. This was something taught to me.<br>STUDY BOOKS on this,  to replace your memories. <br>Past is only a memory, not a reality.<br>Any childhood trauma is only in your head not in your reality."
aymvX-OrlS0,"Nah, make them suffer. <br>It&#39;s not as impossible as you think it is.<br>It&#39;s close though."
aymvX-OrlS0,My mother is the same
aymvX-OrlS0,Yes. It was hurtful. 😢💔😢
aymvX-OrlS0,@May Bee Ok.
aymvX-OrlS0,"Not blame, an explanation"
aymvX-OrlS0,And you can not identify as a skeleton
aymvX-OrlS0,@May Bee my kids are fantastic. If your offended by the truth then you probably fall into that category.
aymvX-OrlS0,👏🏼👐🏼👏🏼👐🏼👏🏼 Amen!
aymvX-OrlS0,Maybe they cannot read expressions because they had refrigerator parents.
aymvX-OrlS0,Abe B. Hmmm I wonder!!
aymvX-OrlS0,I hear it&#39;s never too late to try from what you wrote.
aymvX-OrlS0,Thank you for those wise words.
aymvX-OrlS0,"Thanks for the inspiration.  I’ve gone through a lot of trauma and sustained stress and was generally emotionally neglected and dismissed by my parents... abuse by them no... and I’ve always been resilient and optimistic... I’m just about to turn fifty and this last year I have had trouble with that old resiliency and optimism I was always able to muster... I keep telling myself what you say... I hope I get there... right now, the only thing that seems to work for a few minutes, is to tell myself, ‘since I don’t have the guts to do myself in, I might as well make the best of it’ ... and then I start thinking of how I can shape my future, but I am still so easily overtaken with this extreme avoidance thing I have going on right now.  But thanks for your words of hope!"
aymvX-OrlS0,@Rae Finn yes golden child types tend to be more dysfunctional.
aymvX-OrlS0,Found the preacher preaching that people shouldn&#39;t be preachy. Wow
aymvX-OrlS0,"Dear Lisa I was the scapegoat in my family of origin.  Do you know that the scapegoat gets to be the one who gets away? The others left behind, get eaten.  It doesn&#39;t feel like it now but you are the lucky one.  You were picked because of your strength.  You can feel joy, don&#39;t give up.  Be kind to yourself.  Self mother.  Let go.  I&#39;m thinking of you and I wish you all the love you can now freely give to yourself. Your soul is not dead.  Revive her and go on to live the best life you can because you deserve it.  I survived and then I thrived and I did it all by myself.  You can too."
aymvX-OrlS0,"I can recall a day when I was 2 yrs. old and about 2-3 weeks.  My mother had just had my &quot;baby&quot; brother.  I was staying with my loving aunt and her family.  When my mom came to pick me up, I crawled under one of my aunt&#39;s beds and held on tight to a leg of the bed.  I didn&#39;t want to leave that loving home and see my new &quot;baby brother&quot; even.  I was so neglected beforehand, mom using the old book of letting the baby cry til I fell asleep, etc.  Neglect and abuse was very prevelant in our house; just with me though.  I was the only girl out of 3...….my brothers were saints and I was the black sheep somehow.  I had to start cleaning house, doing dishes, cooking and doing laundry since the age of 6.  At the age of 9, I had to mow the big yard.  Was never allowed to participate in school functions.  All of this took a major toll on my life.<br><br>I had a son, my &quot;miracle child&quot; after 3 miscarriages.  I adored him and told myself I would never treat him like I was.  I was always there for him...….even creating businesses so he could work with me and not be raised by others."
aymvX-OrlS0,Agree!
aymvX-OrlS0,"@Amanda Ly i totally understand it, girl. The problem with me, was that i was always very patient with others, but never with myself. Stay strong, you&#39;ll get better."
aymvX-OrlS0,Reyo Funnyon Patience is important! Im still learning how to be patient with myself and others.
aymvX-OrlS0,We are all affected by the Devil. His actions create ripples of misery across the world and though time.
aymvX-OrlS0,@Lisa Lisa lol
aymvX-OrlS0,luke Fisch yes.. good ol Michael Jackson.
aymvX-OrlS0,@Lisa Lisa Michael Jackson?
aymvX-OrlS0,"You are not alone, I am here with you."
aymvX-OrlS0,@may day with your attitude stay away from other people.
aymvX-OrlS0,"@may day I do stay away from alcohol, thank you for your warmth and compassion."
aymvX-OrlS0,"@may day Precisely. As a man, I am more intelligent and more logical than a waman. If wamen knew best, our societies wouldn&#39;t be crumbling in the last 60 years since we empowered them."
aymvX-OrlS0,"imagine a whole childhood of that,"
aymvX-OrlS0,@may day I don&#39;t follow any religion 😐
aymvX-OrlS0,Danmoz the phone and Facebook are also addictive and f--k up one&#39;s attention span parent or not. I&#39;m afraid for the emotional development of this and future generations.
aymvX-OrlS0,the baby will be okay from these few minutes of social experimentation. the one&#39;s who aren&#39;t okay are the ones who are neglected for long periods of time. my mom would leave me for hours or all night in my crib in my room alone when i cried.
aymvX-OrlS0,"We all have scars. A scar is not the problem, it’s the accumulated, excessive number of them that weighs you down. That was a controlled experiment from which many of us should derive a profound lesson. That baby will probably be fine."
aymvX-OrlS0,@Gene That&#39;s what I hope too.
aymvX-OrlS0,"Just give them your love, your time and take care of them.  That&#39;s all they need. Be patient, kind and play with them and read to/with them. Children don&#39;t need material things, especially when very young. They just need you. It&#39;s not 24/7, there are other things to be done, just when they are awake and with you, interact with them and include them in what you ate doing. A saucepan and wooden spoon while cooking, just stuff like that. Simple stuff. Same applies to both parents."
aymvX-OrlS0,"Maybe try some self help books,might help."
aymvX-OrlS0,Sorry that you went thru that I went thru something similar and ask u that if u know about Jesus Christ becuz he will surly help u if you call on him and ask him to be your savior
aymvX-OrlS0,"hey, try to look into community health centers, they offer free counseling and therapy. I pray that The Lord guides you to good church"
aymvX-OrlS0,Your situation sounds a lot like my husband&#39;s. Sorry that all happened to you 😔
aymvX-OrlS0,"@Hannah Allen I think you have an unfounded faith in psychiatry.  ALL of what they know and do is &quot;psychiatric&quot; drugs, which clearly DO NOT WORK (short term &quot;feel better&quot; is indeed short term, long term is reversed, too often resulting in depression and/or suicide).  One of my college majors was psychology, and after college I worked in hospital psych wards for seven years.  As &quot;psych techs&quot;  (earning orderly pay) we did ALL of the &quot;therapy&quot;  (the shrinks spent 5-10 minutes per week with their patients, and their &quot;treatments&quot; were 1. drugs 2. drugs 3. ECT  4. labotomy and 5. drugs).  The shrinks were clueless.  Just my opinion, but I&#39;ve been there and witnessed it.  If you or a loved one needs help, they should see a respected Psychologist.  Talk therapy is often truly helpful, the drugging avenue is rarely effective and often just adds to the patients&#39; problems.  I now regard  psychiatry as a great swindle, a stinking SCAM."
aymvX-OrlS0,"@no name In my experience of emotionally neglected, I grew up to be very socially awkward. Given the unfortunate fact that I&#39;m the only child, I&#39;m lonely most of the time. I had no social conditioning so it&#39;s really hard for me to make and maintain friendship easily as other people."
aymvX-OrlS0,@Iori Yagami I mean..I&#39;m the same. but I meant in what way other than that?
aymvX-OrlS0,"@no name Maybe, but thanks for the consideration."
aymvX-OrlS0,"a weeb? sorry, I tried to lighten the situation, but for real though?"
aymvX-OrlS0,"Or the baby screaming her head off at Walmart and the parents are yelling at it. And I say no Mama, no Daddy it&#39;s time for you to take the baby home and play with them or give them a nap or food"
aymvX-OrlS0,"The father is important to the child’s development, too, but there is something about a baby’s relationship with the mother that is critical.  FBI profilers found that the one thing all serial killers have in common is that they never bonded with their mothers at a young age."
aymvX-OrlS0,Pity I can only give one thumbs up for your comment.
aymvX-OrlS0,I have time to listen. I have gone through neglection from my parents so I know what this is all about. It hurts even today. 💔🇸🇪😔
aymvX-OrlS0,similar experience here
aymvX-OrlS0,Same here...
aymvX-OrlS0,I just felt that u were describing my life.....
aymvX-OrlS0,"Same! While I could emphasise with them now that I’m older, it scarred me and I’ve been working on it ever since I became aware of the issue. Love your last sentence “working on it”, it won’t be an easy journey but let’s break the cycle with lots of self love!! ❤️❤️❤️"
aymvX-OrlS0,Ditto. I had the exact same experience.
aymvX-OrlS0,"@Victor P. exactly, i mean quite literally who has the nerve to create a website and call it &quot;the school if life&quot;? Also that condescending and patronising voice with Jesus&#39;s English is appalling, to tell the truth..."
aymvX-OrlS0,"What is your question? You asking who is making the video, the presenter or a more philosophical question?"
aymvX-OrlS0,Holy I felt this! Same story here!
aymvX-OrlS0,MCR 9 thank you
aymvX-OrlS0,same here
aymvX-OrlS0,"Mireille Pasgo  -   Honestly...   I really feel so sorry for my mom,<br>because she suffered the most in her family.

aymvX-OrlS0,Alma Wells I’m really sorry you suffered in this way...I’m having my first child soon...trying to avoid these mistakes
aymvX-OrlS0,"Mireille Pasgo  -   I can completely relate to :  Self Self<br>I have a brother, and sister...   and we never got married, <br>nor ever had children. I do not enjoy hugs.<br>I&#39;m happy about the virus, not allowing people to hug me."
aymvX-OrlS0,Agreed!
aymvX-OrlS0,what was the toll? if i may ask...
aymvX-OrlS0,"My story is similar except my parents didn&#39;t feed me and I did have children who don&#39;t hate me, I broke the cycle. I even lost the guy I loved. My parents are in their 80s now, my dad is dying he went from a little Napoleonic complex arrogant SOB to a feeble old man and my mom she&#39;s very young and able-bodied at 83 and she&#39;s a b*<b>*</b>"
aymvX-OrlS0,"@Genia Foster what happened  in your late 30s to change ?  i have recently learnt that a lot of people can not handle a quiet person ,  thats why most people jibber jabber . i had a (female) boss once that was a narcissistic  insecure  idiot , who  labelled me with so many  negatives i ended up seeing a therapist , she blew me away with what she told me about childhood trauma , and she said  &#39;your fine , its your boss who has the problems,.....if you want to  annoy her go silent on her and dont react to her  whatever she says&#39;  , i did that and was sacked 2 weeks later ,  best thing she ever did .  i learnt to walk away immediatly from people like that"
aymvX-OrlS0,@NOT SURE I agree I withdrew in I was a very quiet person until my late 30&#39;s
aymvX-OrlS0,"@Genia Foster yes you probably withdrew into yourself  for self protection , and learnt not to rely on others coz they just invariably let you  down .  we all have a &#39;freudian drive&#39;  which propels us through life and mine is &#39;leave me alone&#39; ...why does your partner have to be in charge , isnt it a shared responsibility ..?"
aymvX-OrlS0,@NOT SURE wow maybe that is why I think that way only relying on myself it sounds so scary to have a husband or boyfriend and allow him to be in charge of our house hold
aymvX-OrlS0,"i  heard this from my primary caregiver as well , apparently when i was about 3 yrs old i screamed for 3 days solid then just went quiet. she was the sort who would stick me in the garden  for hours on end  while she got on with the really important stuff like cleaning the house . until recently i used to think a baby would stop crying if you ignored it long enough , now i realise this is incredibly damaging , for the first 7 years you should  be there when he / she cries because then the baby learns that  he can rely on other people , if you are left alone you learn that the only person you can rely on  is yourself ."
aymvX-OrlS0,@may day he didn&#39;t threw us he abandoned us
aymvX-OrlS0,"That’s harsh... I usually got, ‘nobody cares’."
aymvX-OrlS0,if I cried (which I&#39;ve done rarely) my mom would leave me in the room because I &quot;would calm down faster this way&quot;
aymvX-OrlS0,Yes it&#39;s hard to give emotional energy when you receive none. Even harder when you have to play the role of two parents and hold down a job within weeks of birth
aymvX-OrlS0,Yep hormones are no joke. Mothers that experience those postartum issues are often judged as bad mothers when what they really need is some help/support.
aymvX-OrlS0,Yes yes yes.
aymvX-OrlS0,I can&#39;t even
aymvX-OrlS0,@may day at least not anymore
aymvX-OrlS0,"@Baka Crazy oh I see. Im so sorry for your hardship :( it&#39;s true that when a parent falls ill, the whole dynamic of the family can change and any child in that situation will be affected. I hope you&#39;re able to heal and be in a better place 🙏"
aymvX-OrlS0,@Caramel Cupcake My father got a stroke. We took care of him. And then I was stressed to get good grades at school and getting a good job for having a better life because we are a poor family. That stress made by an aggressive sound. I was afraid of everything since I was a child. So my anxiety grew a lot. My mum always screamed at me when I made mistake. And that made me more and more afraid of everything. I have high sensitivity so every emotion and evey sences feel much more intensive. I didn&#39;t know that for a long time so my parents didn&#39;t too.
aymvX-OrlS0,"If you don&#39;t mind me asking, why? It&#39;s odd for parents to withdraw love after many years of showing love. Usually parents show love from day 1 or they never do"
aymvX-OrlS0,"Jdabomb93 yes absolutely... I have been loosely advocating for that.. I’ve been putting together a list of things that are not stressed enough and should be systematically introduced to people particularly in public education... as a mother I put a lot of effort into teaching my children things they probably would not get in school, but probably should... one such thing, similar to this, is the Asche line experiment  which reveals our tendency to conform regardless of whether there is a real or perceived threat ... another essential bit of knowledge is the Big Lie from Hitlers Mein Kampf... but, a lot of stuff, like this, about parenting is crucial , but the most important lesson is to not expect to be spoon fed or blindly trust and to investigate for yourself rather than whine about how nobody told me, like a lot of people do. And Of course, humanity is responsible for attempting to share pertinent information like, don’t consume arsenic and file taxes and how to read and write and do math etc... I was lamenting to a friend of mine about some deceptive practices that most people fall for and she said, well the information is out there.  And it is. Few are interested in keeping info circulating, more are interested in learning about all the angles... but most people are wandering around not thinking too much about looking into much of anything... and there is a need for spoonfeeding.  I still believe that regardless of the comment my friend made, even though she is right as well."
aymvX-OrlS0,"OfftoShambala <br><br>No it&#39;s now new. Your right.<br><br>But I do believe it&#39;s important, and needs to be talked about. Wouldn&#39;t you agree?"
aymvX-OrlS0,This is not new.
aymvX-OrlS0,@may day -  the baby was caused pain. That is wrong. You don&#39;t know what effect it has.
aymvX-OrlS0,Ashley Cape this is why I raised my Niece tell she was 3. I let my sister go do the partying and so I knew she would get all the love she needed.  It always breaks my heart to see a baby cry.  My sis and mother would let her run around with a fucking shitty dipper and as soon as I see her I would always change her.  I don’t care my kid or not they don’t deserve that shit.  They are way to pressish. And most of all they are babies ajd are future.
aymvX-OrlS0,I started to cry
aymvX-OrlS0,"Though I did get a good laugh when she looked over at the camera, like, &quot;can you believe this shit?&quot;"
aymvX-OrlS0,"@joan n yeah, I don&#39;t mind."
aymvX-OrlS0,Ashley Cape <br>absolutely. i bet it was really hard for the mom too.
aymvX-OrlS0,"I had a similar upbringing... I would not call my parents abusive at all, but they were basically neglectful... sure we had no problem with food or paying the bills ... my parents were both hardworking professionals... but, my dad once said that the reason they never divorced is because whoever wanted to leave had to take us kids.  Thanks dad, it’s nice to be wanted. And apparently that was a fate neither of them wanted.  And I can’t remember what my mom said, much later when I was in my thirties, but something she said prompted me to ask her why she had me(I’m the youngest) and she really did not have an answer... and there are virtually no pictures of me, compared to my two older brothers... by the time I came along it was just too much for them.  Plus back in the 70’s and 80’s there really was very little focus on children... it was all about work for parents... many of us were just left running wild really.  It wasn’t all bad... but, I was constantly dismissed and had little attention.  I was never all that bad... but, I did start acting out at some point in my teens after we moved to s new town and I was suffering from constant bullying from many kids from fifth grade to seventh and my mom started working even longer hours and I was still dismissed emotionally by both my parents... as a mother now, I am appalled at how we were raised... but, the reality is they were essentially good people doing the best they could and I don’t hold it against them at all.. but it still affects me.  They just did not know what they were doing... most parents don’t though."
aymvX-OrlS0,"See that&#39;s the problem, most households today can&#39;t survive on a single income, so both parents must work even if they don&#39;t want to. Parents work hard to provide financially for the family, but forget that emotional and physical support is also just as  important for kids <br><br>But if parents must work long hours to keep a roof over the child&#39;s head, how can they be with the child ? They can&#39;t, and either way the child suffers. What&#39;s the solution? Idk<br><br>Luckily, my mum married a man who was able to provide financially on his own, allowing mum to stay at home with us kids while our dad worked"
aymvX-OrlS0,"This has been known for a long time... it just hasn’t been widely taught or systematically brought to peoples attentions... but, I knew about this concept in the 90’s... I remember hearing about this concept on a few random talk shows... it was in some baby books that were published in the eighties... moms with strong mom instincts know this without having to be told... people have to know to look for a lot of things... but if you think this idea should be well known, then maybe we can work together to make it a requirement in schools. It’s not new."
aymvX-OrlS0,"Remember it&#39;s still a baby. Not even 1,5 years old. Of course you want that baby with you and not sitting alone in it&#39;s crib in a separate room."
aymvX-OrlS0,That doesn’t seem right either
aymvX-OrlS0,"@Wendy Gomez Yes, there are parents who totally fucked up their kids.  My husband told me for many years how his parents fucked him up!  There are parents who should have never had kids in the first place."
aymvX-OrlS0,"Lovely comment, mari. :-)"
aymvX-OrlS0,"@Ricci Hardow driving a sword? What. No lol. You&#39;re watching to much anime my friend. But yeah, some kids commit suicide because of the pressure they feel at school. It&#39;s more prominent in Korea and Japan than in China."
aymvX-OrlS0,"@Ricci Hardow I&#39;m not Chinese. Yeah, I know about those. I think Chinese people place so much pressure on their kids, the Olympics thing is not common tho, but what normal folks do is spend thousands on their kids education. Kids here, study nonstop. Even on Sundays, they go to training schoos of all kind of topics. It&#39;s the same in Korea, Japan etc."
aymvX-OrlS0,"@Lydia Beg nope. That&#39;s not the reason. I live in China. Old people &#39;force&#39; their sons/daughters to have kids as soon as they marry. It&#39;s really common. So lot&#39;s of working adults on their 20&#39;s don&#39;t want to have kids or aren&#39;t prepared for it, and the result is them watching their phones and not paying attention to their own babies."
aymvX-OrlS0,"Asa 45 yr old man, I’m fine, but still have lingering damage from them.  The mother resented staying at home, yet chose that, it was a no win situation.  I think as a major empath I’ve had to learn that nothing I could have said or done as a child would have changed anything.  She was the problem."
aymvX-OrlS0,@Alexis  thats not true. My mother is just as cold and she is aware..they all are..she cant change. She sees how i am with the kids and tries sometimes to emulate because she feels jealous but even that is stiff and awkward like some one who is a bad actor. in our need to absolve our parents we make excuses for why they didnt love us ..we dont want to accept that they were incapable and no it was not our fault either. its hard to deal with so we hide behind every excuse we can justify.
aymvX-OrlS0,"Ugh, I&#39;m in my forties and my older sister recently said something to me that I really feel bad about. She told me that I had scarred her from when we were kids. She was afraid of the dark and, when we were little, me and my sisters slept in the same bed (all girls). And I remember this incident well, but at the time I had no idea. I was in the middle at one end of the bed and she and my sister slept in the opposite direction. One night my sister asked me if I would mind if she slept towards the same side as me as she was scared of the dark. Well, I said &quot;No!&quot; and kept saying &quot;no&quot; because it was funny to me. I wasn&#39;t trying to be mean, but I didn&#39;t believe she was scared and so just thought I was having some fun. Eventually - probably some few hours later - I would say &quot;ok, you can sleep on this side of the bed, too.&quot; Well, apparently that traumatized her - I had no idea. She JUST told me this like a month ago. And I felt genuinely bad. My sister, even though she&#39;s one year older, is much more sensitive than me and as a kid - you don&#39;t recognize that and you can&#39;t articulate that or form some opinion about that. The fact that I caused her emotional harm troubled me, deeply. And I apologized to her. I hope she knew I was sincere. As a kid, I was probably thinking - &quot;how can she really be afraid when we&#39;re all literally right next to each other? She&#39;s just sleeping with her head at the other end  - what&#39;s there to be afraid of?&quot; If I had really known/understood that she was seriously afraid of just being in the dark - maybe her imagination was more active about the things lurking in the dark than mine - I would never have teased her. I don&#39;t believe in teasing people about things that really scare them. So, your comment resonated with me about you being scared and begging your mom if you could sleep with her. I&#39;m so sorry that she was so dismissive and sent you back into a fearful situation. I have long since decided (even before my sister&#39;s revelation) that if I have kids and they want to sleep in bed with me for any reason - they will be allowed to. Kids want to be near their mom - they feel protected and safe when they are close to the body that knows and nurtures them and there can&#39;t be anything wrong with that. Granted, there are times when that won&#39;t be possible - hello, momma and daddy gotta get their groove on sometime, but whenever possible, I would allow it. I would teach my kids to nurture and not torture (even if it&#39;s just playing around) each other, too. I&#39;m glad you took a different approach with your kids."
aymvX-OrlS0,The heifer had no business having kids... and she had 14?!?!
aymvX-OrlS0,"Wow. Same. <br>But my mom have 12 siblings... (you know, people in the XX)."
aymvX-OrlS0,At 22 I&#39;m still ignored when I speak and my therapist said it&#39;s what created a fear of rejection in me. Now when I&#39;m ignored by my parents I make sure to not be and be listened to but the damage is here. I love them and they treated me well apart from that but that one issue ended up with issues now where I have hard time to let go of &quot;friends&quot; even if theyre bad for me or don&#39;t treat me well. I&#39;m working on it tho.
aymvX-OrlS0,Hi Melon sauce the Bible is very useful for all sorts relationships. Have a look at Ephesians 6:1--4 . Particularly verse 4 as it tell us as parents to be consistent with the training of our children. So don&#39;t irritate them be fair and let them know where they stand . So the whole family has the same standard to follow.
aymvX-OrlS0,"As a child I was always asking about everything. When I asked for something and didn&#39;t get it, I was interested why my mom wouldn&#39;t buy it. but my mom refused to explain it to me, so I would get mad about the fact, that she ignored my question more than not getting the thing I wanted."
aymvX-OrlS0,"@Lydia Beg Then get a therapy and don&#39;t have children maybe? My dad shouldn&#39;t have children, he had awfull childhood as far as I know. But no, I am one of four of his children and I don&#39;t see he&#39;s getting better."
aymvX-OrlS0,"@Lydia Beg You can just learn to be a good parent despite your childhood as an adult. That&#39;s may be hard but don&#39;t use that as an excuse. Also , use more than the Bible to raise kids. It isn&#39;t a parent manual."
aymvX-OrlS0,"Your sis has a good chance of still being ok as long as you continue being the mother. In your free time, play with her, talk to her, hold her and give her lots of kisses. It will be hard, but if you can be her parental figure your sis will grow up happy. It&#39;s not too late for her :)"
aymvX-OrlS0,"Yeah me too :( it was only for 2 minutes and it won&#39;t ever happen again, so baby will forget and so luckily no lasting damage"
aymvX-OrlS0,"@Valerie R Goodness me Valerie-what an horrendous time you have had. Very sorry to hear about your difficulties. If they make vaccines mandatory....? We still have freedom of choice here but for how much longer? I have been studying and practicing bioresonance according to Paul Schmidt for the past 9 years, initially for my own health. It started me off researching in depth all of this stuff so now I&#39;m trying to help others. I sometimes feel like&#39; Alice through the looking glass&#39; but the reality is the other side of the mirror and its very very unpleasant."
aymvX-OrlS0,"@Lynn Attwood I have my own, real life vaccine study.  I have 2 sons, many years apart in age.   My  younger son received many more vaccines than my older son, due to additions to the vaccine schedule.  His immune system was so weakened by his 4 mo vaccines that he almost died from the RSV Virus.   He was hospitalized in isolation in an oxygen tent for 6 days.   After that, he was chronically I&#39;ll with severe asthma,  frequent upper respiratory infections, and high fevers.  He has learning disabilities and ADHD.  He&#39;s outgrown the asthma, and worked to overcome his learning disabilities.  He will be graduating high school this year at the age of 20.  He&#39;s been attending an online high school where he can work at his own pace.  They have a brick and mortar site where he can go if he needs support.  <br>My older son, who didn&#39;t receive as many vaccines, was much healthier (only had a few ear infections), and was always in the &quot;Gifted&quot; program at school.  He graduated high school early, and became a sound engineer."
aymvX-OrlS0,"@Valerie R Hi Valerie! :) no offence taken! I&#39;m also totally on board with the link between Autistic symptoms and vaccine damage, which is what I prefer to call it. Dr Andy Wakefield, whom the British Gov, sadly, discredited has now come back big time along with Del Bigtree and many others especially in USA with his in depth research on this link. He says that if the same trajectory carries on by 2030 every other child will be &#39;autistic&#39;. Vaccine madness is one piece of the jigsaw of course, microwaving the population from egg and sperm in the parents and pollution another and then the psychological damage from abuse and neglect. It&#39;s pretty grim isn&#39;t it..."
aymvX-OrlS0,"@Lynn Attwood Hello in Ireland, Lynn!  I&#39;m a retired teacher.  I taught in Las Vegas, Nevada.  I live in Colorado now.  I have a gift for relating to children, making them feel comfortable, and bringing them out of their shell.  So when I smile at a toddler or small child and I get a blank stare back, it&#39;s a warning sign.  I think neglect, or Autism from too many unsafe vaccines.  (I&#39;m not an anti-vaxer, I just object to the huge increase in the number of vaccines given, and some of the harmful ingredients.)  As a teacher, I saw an exponential increase in Autism, learning disabilities, and health problems over the years.  I also saw an big  increase in kids with behavioral and emotional problems. Very sad to see.  Hope I haven&#39;t offended you."
aymvX-OrlS0,"Go get therapy for your traumatic experiences. Please do this now so you don&#39;t, for lack of a better word, fuck your son up. Your child deserves an attentive, loving parent, and you can give that to him if you get help"

aymvX-OrlS0,"Smartphone addiction is just a symptom and/or catalyzer, not the cause, as this psychological problem is older than high tech. People always confuse symptoms and causes in so many things."
aymvX-OrlS0,"Yes we can, just cause parents were abused themselves, that doesn&#39;t mean their clueless and that they should continue the cycle of abuse as adults. I&#39;m sure rapists were also abused as kids, but that doesn&#39;t justify their terrible actions as adults <br><br>No matter how badly you were abused as a kid, at some point you must take responsibility and not continue the cycle of abuse on others"
aymvX-OrlS0,"@Kay Cee when I get those memories I am joyful because my life is so different now.I see where I was and where I&#39;ve come too.I learned to embrace the now and not let the past haunt <a href=""http://me.it/"">me.It</a> took a while for me to get to that point!"
aymvX-OrlS0,Sometimes I would get these memories from when i was growing up and it just makes me feel so down i cant explain why. I wish i could erase them.
aymvX-OrlS0,@Paul Jennings It&#39;s goings that way @ 63
aymvX-OrlS0,Who doesn&#39;t?
aymvX-OrlS0,@Steve Dyches you&#39;re so very welcome
aymvX-OrlS0,That love you are looking for has to come from within...it takes a lot of courage to fight against negative thoughts and turn them positive. At first you won’t believe it but continue to do it until one day all the positives thoughts become easier to accept and finally you allow yourself to believe them. Slowly you will built and form that internal love that you seek from outside sources but this time it will come from within.
aymvX-OrlS0,But you ARE loved.  You&#39;re not a mistake and you were created on purpose and for a purpose.
aymvX-OrlS0,You&#39;re not alone in that feeling
aymvX-OrlS0,UpCycler A1 what does this even mean?
aymvX-OrlS0,"Dario Baez Wrong.  Babies/kids need love, support, understanding, guidance and good models set for them.  Too many parents project their own motivations/dysfunction onto their kids, repeating their own parents mistakes and repeating the cycle.  Babies and small children don’t ‘manipulate’ in the way adults do, and treating them that way <b>causes</b> that behavior, or worse, later in life."
aymvX-OrlS0,@Nikolai Gubenko: Modernity IS the problem.
aymvX-OrlS0,Modern problems require modern solutions!
aymvX-OrlS0,"Well syrely they should have cleaned their mess before bringing additional people into the world, but I also think one should not be too harsh on people that commit suicide. They probably do not do it for fun. There re also people without &quot;problems that seen happy but at the end kill themselves too..."
aymvX-OrlS0,Katta Lady Ever asked why one was suicidal?
aymvX-OrlS0,I agree. 😢💘💔💘😢
aymvX-OrlS0,@Katherine Poltoratzky I think u can get valid emotional support from others but the child in all of us always wants that parental validation even if they don&#39;t speak to their parents anymore. U can live a full life with love and happiness but i feel that there will always be a void and missing spot in someone who didnt grow up properly
aymvX-OrlS0,"To the sentence:&quot;They look for anything to give them that emotional acceptance they never got in childhood, but now they look for it through sex and companionship, though they&#39;ll never get it&quot;....why do you think they&#39;ll never get it?"
aymvX-OrlS0,that really brings it to a point.
aymvX-OrlS0,"Liand Adragon nah totally possible to do a 4  min synopsis of attachment &amp; attunement needs &amp; influences on a 0-3 yr old child. Only about 6 exist. <br>Children are surrounded now by what this experimenter called “stone face”. Attunement isn’t rocket science, but it’s heavily dependent on external factors as well as insensitivity to nuances of interactions between individuals."
aymvX-OrlS0,@elissamarcus Yep. That&#39;s me. It&#39;s usually either one extreme or the other.
aymvX-OrlS0,"@elissamarcus this is why as much as possible, people will want to have a family because they&#39;ve mature enough and really capable before bringing another soul in this world before they do so."
aymvX-OrlS0,...and some of them are loners and have difficulties forming relationships. Some of them are super over achievers- hoping to accomplish something so mom and dad notice. There are a lot of different results of emotional neglect.
aymvX-OrlS0,@WhatGoesAround ComesAround you are correct
aymvX-OrlS0,The boyfriend is probably just as damaged. And I would not presume to offer any advice.
aymvX-OrlS0,Why would she encourage you to get sick? You are just not supposed to!
aymvX-OrlS0,andrew Hoard THIS.
aymvX-OrlS0,"Meat, eggs and organs heal depression and anxiety, not fruit and veggies."
aymvX-OrlS0,Same with me. My dad was there physically but not emotionally. I was closer to my mom but neither one of the really supported my emotional health.  When you feel neglected it teaches you not to reach out to others and stay closed off emotionally to others.
aymvX-OrlS0,Yes.  But there could be other factors... how much exercise are you getting? Are you eating mostly junk food and not enough fresh fruit and veg?  These factors can compound the depression from emotional neglect or trauma experienced in childhood.
aymvX-OrlS0,i was not maternal because my mum was not but i did show interest in my kids i took them and fetched them from school and i took care of them it was the hugs and and playing that was hard for me
aymvX-OrlS0,"Muriel Oduro True, but mainly mothers get a bad rap. What about still-faced fathers? There are legions of them!"
aymvX-OrlS0,I&#39;m not maternal. I chose not to have kids or have anything to do with them.
aymvX-OrlS0,"Finally, not all women are naturally maternal. We really should stop pushing that on people."
aymvX-OrlS0,Faye Good for you 🙂

aymvX-OrlS0,"Once you realise that, everything is a bonus."
aymvX-OrlS0,spiritualism has been working for me so far
aymvX-OrlS0,"You have to reparent yourself. Or, be the parent you needed for your own children. That&#39;s what&#39;s helped me recover from my own childhood. My mom tried but she fell way short of nurturing my emotional needs and did a lot of harm. I beat up everybody until puberty because I was so angry. I finally outgrew it parenting my son. I needed to so I could teach him how to manage his own feelings and nurture his well being."
aymvX-OrlS0,"@Fox Nechifor You are right.<br>I have found God to be unfailingly faithful, in His healing ministrations to me! I called out to Him, wanting healing &gt; emotional, spiritual, mental, physical, and He has never failed. Right now He&#39;s working on my emotional healing. I had no emotional nurture in childhood ... in learning this, I learned that &quot;people can&#39;t give, what they never got&quot;. My folks came from dysfunctional families, hence their own dysfunctional family! But God CAN overcome any and all of the hurts, wounds and bruises! Our part &gt; trust Him to do so...surrender to Him ... and He will NEVER let you down!!!"
aymvX-OrlS0,Meditation is bad it actually attracts demons  <br>God heals everything if you ask him to.
aymvX-OrlS0,"@Cheryl Vergin Thank you for your comment, and congratulations on the progress you&#39;ve made. I wonder how much of your success has been due to the shift of responsibility from &quot;others&quot; to yourself? I think accepting responsibility for our happiness is very important. However, I am confused when it comes to assigning responsibility to ourselves in terms of deciding which conditions to place ourselves in when we are very young or prior to being born. I have no memories before age 4, which is somewhat normal so it seems reasonable to conclude I wasn&#39;t making any conscious choices before that age. If there&#39;s any conclusive studies indicating otherwise, I am not aware of those."
aymvX-OrlS0,"@WhatGoesAround ComesAround it&#39;s true. She does initiate first move.. Being me, without even realizing it, I push her away with ignoring, shouting and scolding. No matter how hard I try not to be that person"
aymvX-OrlS0,I would suggest not to try to do anything.  Let go and be receptive. Watch the video: she knows how to start the interaction.
aymvX-OrlS0,"A minute amount. But you saw how the infant bounced back. It probably won&#39;t even remember that little aberration.  It is like stretching a spring: It bounces back unless it has become overstretched and permanently deformed. It all gets mixed and averaged out. They seem to have remarkable power of recovery. It is only when the negative experience is reinforced sufficiently, that the conditioning becomes fixed."
aymvX-OrlS0,Sorry: out of my depth. But I believe you: there are no lower limits to human behaviour.
aymvX-OrlS0,"That was controlled. Maybe gruesome to watch, but very important to demonstrate and to understand."

aymvX-OrlS0,"@batonbeauty I think you&#39;re misunderstanding what I am saying. I&#39;m saying that we, as a society, allow horrible behavior from one another. Yes, children are their parents responsibility, (unless they&#39;ve relinquished that responsibility) but we also have a responsibility as a society to the people and children that live in it. When we allow emotional neglect and abuse of children in front of our faces and dismiss it as &quot;not my problem&quot; then you&#39;re part of the problem. These things can only exist if society turns a blind eye. When we go out with our &quot;friends&quot; and get drunk with them every weekend while their chidren are emotionally neglected, we are contributing to the problem. We as a society need to demand more from one another, stop tolerating things we shouldn&#39;t, stop blaming the parents or anyone for that matter, take responsibility and contribute to a solution. When you&#39;re contributing to the solution, you stop blaming others."

aymvX-OrlS0,@Ricci Hardow Thank you for replying! I am s single parent of 2 Adult High-Functioning Autistic Son and Daughter ! It wasn&#39;t easy but I&#39;m a proud and happy parent because both of them are high school grads.Unfortunately..Society..and even mental/ health community ..social services ..etc tend to blame the biological mother for the syndrome! Thankfully ..my kids received the best of Special Needs education here in Michigan..after being diagnosed at around a year and half! Both are High School Grads and are working fulltime 😊 And can live a semi independent life ( with support personnel checking in with them if I&#39;m unable)! <br>And both know not to &quot;follow&quot; the crowd ( peer pressure) and also be careful with family members to so as not to be taken advantage of..<br>And never to be afraid to ask ( even if it&#39;s a dumb question) ! I could go on and on..but ..<br>Just wanted to let you know that you are right..there are many factors to take in consideration!! Me..my hope is that my kids after I&#39;m dead will be okay in their life..

aymvX-OrlS0,"Malignant narcissists are excessively afraid of dying alone. I believe that is their reason for having children, and I believe it is because they have no connection to God."
aymvX-OrlS0,"@NOT SURE Which sucks because you&#39;re putting all of this emotional burden on a child. I had kids for the opposite reason, I didn&#39;t have love growing up and wanted to give the love to my children that I never received."
aymvX-OrlS0,"i think a lot of people have kids because they think the child will provide them with the unconditional love they never got from their parents , but it doesnt usually  work"
aymvX-OrlS0,"i have had the same experience...but am glad i tried. i think this treatment left me feeling hopeless about trying to communicate, and so just gave up trying as a kid. To me it is a victory to just do my part and tell her what i think and feel, which is scary. I did get the invalidation i feared but at least i tried."
aymvX-OrlS0,That&#39;s not the point. I think you missed the whole point. If a baby does not have a primary caregiver who allows and teaches emotional regulation to the baby and ignores the baby this is called emotional abuse or emotional neglect and it does impact people when they become adults or even as they age and childhood.

aymvX-OrlS0,Wanda Willow Orourke and it’s crazy how the ones who lack empathy also wants us empaths to serve them with a golden stick yeah right . I’ll show those sociopaths where they can stick that golden spoon !
aymvX-OrlS0,Wanda Willow Orourke people who lack emotionally empathy are similar to narcissists &amp; sociopaths. They can’t feel anything. Numb to life especially when life has been treating them well. Smh.... it’s like rich vs the poor.
aymvX-OrlS0,Like the Asians?
aymvX-OrlS0,"@Melon Sauce:  You go ask the Scandinavian&#39;s about their income tax rates. Denmark’s effective income tax rate is 60.4%. Sweden’s is 56.4%. Finland&#39;s is 53.4%. Norway’s is 39%. Canadians don&#39;t fare much better at 33%. Perhaps the red in &quot;Red Scare&quot; is also applicable to the red tape of a socialist bureaucracy, as well as socialist countries having their budgets in the red when they run out of their citizens&#39; tax dollars to spend and have to pick their pockets for yet more. Since when has any national government entity ever administered anything competently or efficiently? And socialism equals big government.<br><br>&quot;The goal of socialism is communism.&quot; ~Vladimir Lenin"

aymvX-OrlS0,"@JAH MagicDragon: Very true! I also believe in being good stewards of the earth. But, remember, no one is born grateful or humble; these are learned virtues. Suffering brings wisdom; but, everyone&#39;s path in life is different, and so each one&#39;s learning curve in life is different too. It is best to pity those that have not the resourcefulness you have acquired, or your ability to recognize their value. I often struggle with bitterness toward people in general---and arrogant rich assholes in particular. I do think it&#39;s possible for people to change for the better, but rarely can that happen without them being humbled by suffering. Humility is the key to unlocking all other virtues, and suffering forges that key. I just try to keep fighting the good fight, knowing that in the end there will be justice...and a lot of hell to pay!"
aymvX-OrlS0,"Yes, and I would have refused to do it."
aymvX-OrlS0,Eleni Kara I remember my parents doing this to me for fun as a very young child. I don&#39;t talk to my parents as an adult. You can imagine the type of childhood I had (or didn&#39;t have).
aymvX-OrlS0,@Steve Silver A lot of serial killers had abusive fathers.
aymvX-OrlS0,Most serial killer books are read by Woman. They can be a wolf in sheep clothing.
aymvX-OrlS0,That’s truly sick. Awful!

aymvX-OrlS0,"Yes, but there&#39;s a window of opportunity, and when it&#39;s over the damage is done."
aymvX-OrlS0,A speech therapist told me the same and we ignored him and he got always angry and crying always only to later find out that he was autistic and that was the only way he would make his needs known. I can&#39;t stand stupidity! We never went back. He still is non verbal now at 5 but still points and we pass what he needs.
aymvX-OrlS0,"No. Forgiveness is the result of healing, not the cause. If you push yourself to forgive it will not be real. In time you will pity the people who hurt you because they are in trouble, but it may take a lot of time, and you must allow yourself that time. It has to be real."
aymvX-OrlS0,Actually I don&#39;t want to get married.
aymvX-OrlS0,My daughter moved out at 18 (fiercely independent woman). She stops by to do laundry or grab a meal once or twice a week. But after about two months of her living on her own I sent her a card via snail mail. In the card I wrote how much I love her and admire her strength but she&#39;ll always have a place here at home if the need arises. She called me when she opened it and got all choked up when she said her strength can be attributed to knowing her parents have always had her back. I never felt that way toward my parents but I&#39;m glad I was able to do better.
aymvX-OrlS0,Love to you.
aymvX-OrlS0,"@Denise ❤️ Yes, I know she is a narc. She created two others in my sisters. I don&#39;t know if it was her father or mother that traumatized her into becoming a narcissist. I never got the chance to really know either of them. My best guess is the father. It is also my belief that my mother is totally responsible for destroying our family. She is still at it relentlessly and she is 79 years old. Our sibling relationships are very poor as with all the other relatives. Again, my mothers doing. I see little chance for any reconciliation after her passing. <br>I knew a man who was charged with molestation of his 2-year-old daughter, brought on by his ex-wife. Never learned about the outcome, but the allegations were problematic enough for him I&#39;m sure.<br>I hope your life and spirit is much better now that you have been free for 6 years."
aymvX-OrlS0,@Steve Dyches she&#39;s definitely a narcissist. My mom is too. She would constantly talk bad about my step father even though she was married to him! When he divorced her she said he was molesting us. When I didn&#39;t play along with her narrative she started to malign me as well. I&#39;ve been free from her for six years and I&#39;m never looking back!
aymvX-OrlS0,"@Denise ❤️ Yeah, I was raised by a single mother that told us she left our dad once she realized she didn&#39;t need him. Only saw him once a year after that. Still didn&#39;t take long to learn he was much kinder than she was. My mother did a lot of bad shit, that&#39;s for sure. As we got older she left us at home alone more often. That became our only peaceful time at home. Suppose it didn&#39;t matter or occur to her that I and my two older sisters did need him. About the only thing she did was barely feed us and constantly remind us what burdens we were. She&#39;ll be gone soon enough, and her reign of terror will finally end."
aymvX-OrlS0,Dont have kids then. It&#39;s a choice not a requirement
aymvX-OrlS0,My mom was a stay at home mom and didn&#39;t do shit. Extremely neglectful.
aymvX-OrlS0,DetroitRed03 my exact feelings. Also I love your thumbnail. That glowin melanin 👍🏽
aymvX-OrlS0,"​@Freddie Boom Boom Washington The video depicted the reality of a mother cold-facinig her year-old child for two minutes, despite the child&#39;s visible extreme distress. The yearling was no actor, and her fright and distress no simulation. Albeit to educate viewers for all time (and so prevent future emotional abuse by indifference to young children), this video experiment really distressed a real baby for two minutes."
aymvX-OrlS0,"ST. KL sounds like a narcissistic person . But yes you are right , adults struggle with no response too"
aymvX-OrlS0,"Same. I literally shed a tear...thugs don&#39;t cry but this, this was cold man😭"
aymvX-OrlS0,It affected me in the same way.  I had to switch it off at that point.
aymvX-OrlS0,I felt the same way and I dont have a baby either. Interesting that the mom they used in the experiment seemed to be a very loving and attentive mom and we all picked up on that by the way the BABY reacted to her. Very interesting.
aymvX-OrlS0,I felt something... like a bit of discomfort watching that part
aymvX-OrlS0,"Grew up with an alcoholic father that use to beat up my siblings. I was pretty violent as a child,a bully. I believe this"
aymvX-OrlS0,"My kid got sick at school the other day, so the nurse called.  She repeatedly thanked me, on the phone and in person, for coming to pick up my sick child and take him home.  There were a couple of other kids in there with sad looks on their faces.  I wonder if they had to sit there all day?"
aymvX-OrlS0,Do you mind naming some of the differences you see? I&#39;m curious.
aymvX-OrlS0,"@Lydia Beg when it comes to forgivenes i dont have to forgive myself anything but they DO need my forgivenes but i wont give it to them and i do curse them and im not ashamed of that at all (coz they did it to me so i can do to them) - especially those asshole (actually more than one person) who was abusing me, molested and destroyed my entire family and i know for a fact he will end up with nothing and noone in hell and he deserved that looooong time ago. So dont say i need to forgive for myself. I did nothing wrong."
aymvX-OrlS0,"@Lydia Beg I do agree with everything u say and thats why but not only i used to forgive but i found out its destroying me and she just dont get that. My mother started to be this way when my father started to drink but... Theres story before that - there was a guy who actually was &quot;around&quot; my family but noone wanted him but still he found a way to destroy my family slowly over time and he started from my father. Answering to your question yes i do like myself but i find it difficult to not help even when i know someone is using me also its not easy for me ti help myself. Before in past i was believing in God (good God) but now i dont go to church etc. but from that time i was always begging, literally begging for evryone else except me... and i think it says a lot about me and its true ppl like us tend to forget abut themselves which isnt good also. I knew my mother abuses me throught all those times but they also use money, situation and everything they can to keep u in that situation. When i was working abroad she started to &quot;be sick&quot;... She had heart attack, heart operation but now somehow she is alive. Ofcorse she complains but i dont listen to that shit anymore... Also it was my &quot;duty&quot; to help evryone, literally everyone but still she would say its not enought money, its not goood but when i was mad she said &quot;but your sis have family&quot; so its another generation who is screwed up which i recently told her that she always says how shitty i am but when it comes to money and rescue everyone around she knows a way to find me and i also told her thats its her job, not mine coz she screwed a lot of that, not me... She told me its nottrue i was abused (why im not suprised?) and i wasnt molested and she didnt want to sell me to rich guy when i was 12y old...  - not literallly &quot;sell&quot; but she would want me to meet him if he wasnt rich so yeah...  Besides when i finally got more money so i could start (finally) my life without her guess what... She found a way to make me loose them... so i ended up with depression without money and now she says i need to find job coz she doesnt want me arround but ive heard what is her real motivation - she thinks ill work for her... again...I told her that ive heard everything and guess what.... she lied again so i know she want to use me again. Trust me right now when im writingthis im crying like i was during nights for all those years so noone could hear/ see it but the difference is im sick of it... and it doesnt work on me anymore."
aymvX-OrlS0,"@Lydia Beg i was thinking about what u said but the problem is they use forgiveness or goodness to use u even more. Same with love - and yes, they can cry even to make u think they care but it is a lie."
aymvX-OrlS0,"@Lydia Beg I live with her and she still abuses me but ive learned how to dont give a shit about her but forgiving isnt an option here - ive done that for years and years and i know now that it isnt solution and i agree u must cut off such ppl and u by saying about forgivenes i know even more that uve been abused heavily coz we tend to forgive which destroys us and sometimes might be considered as selfkilling but they dont care coz how would they care if they think its u who is the problem? Even Jesus didnt say to forgive everyone. Condition to forgive is when they understand what they did and really want to change and we both know that such ppl rarely change. I do and dont agree with u about the part of having children coz i think there are some ppl who could heal them selves but we both know that its not always easy. I dont want to have children not only because of that but from many reasons. Im healthy when it comes to that but trust me i wish to change with my friend who cant have children. I know that it is caused by abusive parent but not only because of that and its annoying how society tells everyone how they should live - have husband, children etc. Even religions says that but reality is much different. They dont understand that its is another abuse - coz they alll &quot;know&quot; how your life should look like but they dont want to deal with consequences if sth goes wrong later coz &quot;its your life&quot;. Also many of them have fucked up life so how the fuck can they say what your life should look like? - it is fucking annoying and its bull shit."
aymvX-OrlS0,"@Lydia Beg i do agree and i think most of them shouldnt EVER have chidren. I was abused, told she loves me (which isnt true) and also she thinks thats its me who is wrong abut things but she basically screwed my life and my sis but after what she did she dont forget to come to me for money or fixing things... Its all fucked up. I think that entire society almost is sick and parenting is only one of examples and its only tip of iceberg... Also relgion dosnt help with that coz mostly they say u should have children but its the opposite they should think if person should have children. I myself dont want children and never wanted them and i was ostracised for that even by my own sis who was also abused but in different way... hers children now they cry at night so they are also abused... - same as i was crying years and years at night so noone could see that coz i didnt want anyone to knw about that coz i was &quot;teached&quot; not to talk about stuff...  It all started not from my mother, but from my drinking father and before that from someone who came close to family and little by little destroyed it. He claims that im the one who is fucked up but its the opposite and i know hell get his punish coz he screwed up not only my life but all my family not to mention how many ppl before..."

aymvX-OrlS0,"@Nat Think of a brain as a field. When you&#39;re young, the grass in your field is just starting to grow. It&#39;s short, soft, easy to cut paths through. Each experience you have creates a pathway through this field. The more times you experience a particular action or event, the deeper that particular pathway is cut. If your caregiver is consistently negligent then you grow up with the pathway to animosity. If you experience a lot of inconsistent behaviors you&#39;ll have paths that aren&#39;t well defined or sometimes just dead end. As you age the field gets taller, more dense, and harder to create new pathways. <br>My point is that this child in the video will likely not suffer any adverse emotions if the caregiver returned to modeling loving behavior after this experiment."
aymvX-OrlS0,Think about all those babies out there being raised by parents that won&#39;t even look at them because they&#39;re too busy looking at their phones.
aymvX-OrlS0,@M. Di Federico Absentee fathers

aymvX-OrlS0,"Sheridan Smith <br>I&#39;m replying to M Di Ferderico<br>Who said 90% of children are raised by single mothers, if this is correct I want to know where the b hell are the fathers, very easy to blame the parent that bothered to stay"
aymvX-OrlS0,M. Di Federico <br>Where did you get this 90% from? What study are you quoting?
aymvX-OrlS0,Damn u living my life too ..way too many people have the samestory to not be able to connect and share with the world I wish we could all get together and be each others family
aymvX-OrlS0,@Lisa Please explain where this heavenly father is while children are being abused?
aymvX-OrlS0,"it only mess you up till you are unaware of it. When you get to know it, it is your own responsibility to cure it. Stop blaming people in your past because it is not useful to you today. Make yourself happy today on your own.<br>Just like you may be born with a genetic disease, so you have to take remedial measures.<br>And you are not special, everybody has a different problem of this category. <br>Buck up !! <br>&quot;Replace your memories&quot;. This was something taught to me.<br>STUDY BOOKS on this,  to replace your memories. <br>Past is only a memory, not a reality.<br>Any childhood trauma is only in your head not in your reality."
aymvX-OrlS0,Same...
aymvX-OrlS0,dude same
aymvX-OrlS0,"Pretty much the same case as mine.<br>Can i tell you my story?<br>When i was a 4 year old boy, my mom told me that she and my dad wanted to have only 2 kids. 1 boy and 1 girl. Their first child was a boy then comes the second one was a boy again, so they tried to have kids for the 3rd time still it was a boy then finally my mom conceive a girl, so now the have 4 kids. 3 sons and one daughter. What a bit shocked me was the next thing she said. She said that after my sister was born they decided that &quot;that&#39;s it we&#39;re not gonna have another kid&quot;. (Which would make anyone assume that they probably started using contraception, i.e. condom or pills.) and so they didn&#39;t expect mom to be pregnant. But i was conceived. And what she said next ultimately put a hole in my soul and doubt in my own existence. She said, &quot;you&#39;re not supposed to be born but since you&#39;re already here, there&#39;s nothing that we can do&quot; .<br>And then it all made sense to me, as to why they are so emotionally absent towards me, and would not give any attention to the things that i value and liked as a kid. i was treated like i was a mistake and an obligation and not a gift., so as if only abortion was legal in my country i wouldn&#39;t be here."
aymvX-OrlS0,jennti What the video is trying to teach is the specific definition of what it means to &quot;do their job&quot;.  Many people have different ideas of what it means to be a good parent.  The video is attempting to make people be aware that specifically emotional attention is a very necessary part of that because many people feel that financially providing well and not abusing is all it takes.
aymvX-OrlS0,"Even privileged homes. It&#39;s hard to feel sorry for the rich kid, but you&#39;d be amazed at how horribly emotionally neglected some of them are."
aymvX-OrlS0,@nick san I doubt the dursleys ever smiled at him
aymvX-OrlS0,"He may have had a rough childhood, he did not experience the same illustration of neglect, it was not evident in the movie"
aymvX-OrlS0,"You&#39;ve answered your own question, Tenxi. Your parents failed you in the worst possible way. When you are able to confront the trauma and deal with it, you will feel better. I wish you peace."
aymvX-OrlS0,I wish you peace.
aymvX-OrlS0,Right back at you!
aymvX-OrlS0,Bless you and yours.
aymvX-OrlS0,don&#39;t sleep train them if you can find a way not to. Which is not easy in our culture but if you can afford help it would be worth it.
aymvX-OrlS0,"julie, we can be born to the most loving, attentive parents, but still suffer with a variety of mental health conditions. I hope you can find the help that you need, and achieve complete and lasting peace of mind."
aymvX-OrlS0,"But you also need quantity time to catch everything that happens and respond because children learn in practice, not in theory. You need both."
aymvX-OrlS0,You sound like a very nice person. Peace.
aymvX-OrlS0,I wish you peace.
aymvX-OrlS0,Maybe they&#39;ll be moved to not repeat the pattern with their children. That is the hope.
aymvX-OrlS0,It is simply too much power for most of us.
aymvX-OrlS0,"This is my look on it, too. I&#39;m sad for the baby, these experiments should not happen at all - they&#39;re damaging."
aymvX-OrlS0,MLee Potts exactly.  There has to be another way to figure this shit out without traumatizing babies.
aymvX-OrlS0,"K W, without realizing it, your mother failed you. It wasn&#39;t her fault, circumstances forced her hand. The good news, is that you seem to have a great deal of personal insight, it is a testament to your ability to survive, and whether you understand it or not, it has served you well.<br>Please seek professional help. Your outlook could improve dramatically with an understanding counselor. I wish you complete peace of mind."
aymvX-OrlS0,its not the phones coz if not phones such ppl will find sth else... I think that not everyone should have children but most ppl dont even think about it.
aymvX-OrlS0,Its probably going to be about the same. Older generations loved the seen not heard rule.
aymvX-OrlS0,Maureen m That is a good teacher

aymvX-OrlS0,"@NOT SURE I agree with your last sentence. When I was studying psychology in college we were told of many creepy experiment &quot;scientist&quot; were doing with people. I&#39;m sure that what they claim about Jonov was exaggeration. There are some people who are very disturbed and commit suicide, but not over reading books. More likely with some crazy therapies that push them over the edge. Things are even worse now."
aymvX-OrlS0,"I kinda had one of those talks with my mom... you may have already done it, but if she shows some remorse, apply forgiveness."

Cause I can .. cause of him.. in me.. be strong and love yourself.... and forgive ourselves.. he does.. be good peace..
aymvX-OrlS0,It&#39;s called attachment theory and you can go see a counselor who specializes in childhood trauma. You can still heal and become emotionally healthy.
aymvX-OrlS0,Yes tat true only god   have good intentions about his creation
aymvX-OrlS0,You&#39;re not alone ❤️ I feel your pain
aymvX-OrlS0,"@M M Stop exaggerating like the psychiatrists do. Anyone can be a psych with just 4 yrs of college to make $250k a year! It&#39;s a crock for greed!<br><br>Babys, children have the skills necessary to survive what most adults cannot.. Im not talking about abuse, I&#39;m talking about this BS vid of not jumping to attend the babies every whim.<br><br>Go see how the past generations did it. They left children to learn, to fend for themselves and past generations turned out the most productive  relaxed, loving children as adults, compared to todays disaster...<br><br>Kids today are all addicts, all depressed, suicidal thanks to Psychiatry!"
aymvX-OrlS0,"Yes, the baby can only know it is safe or that it will survive if the parent is there to take care of it. If the parent is not attentive, or does not recognize the baby’s needs/can’t meet them, the baby’s brain goes into survival mode. This can cause its brain to adapt to that if it occurs often. As an adult, or throughout the child’s life, this survival mode can be triggered by seemingly innocuous things. The child can adapt to what is called “learned helplessness” where it learns that it cannot do anything about its circumstances. There are many problems that ignoring a child’s needs, including emotional needs can cause — psychological, emotional, physical. That’s not an impatient baby, that’s a scared and helpless baby."
aymvX-OrlS0,TheJdjgirl   It is the only way to find true healing!
aymvX-OrlS0,Witch in the Woods I’m sorry honey. My mom was emotionally neglectful of me as well. The pain never leaves. I’m hoping there’s a Heavenly Mother that we’ll be reunited with someday. It’s just a hope
aymvX-OrlS0,Some people arent the hugging type. Mines never hugged me either
aymvX-OrlS0,Gene<br>I would love for all the people who insist that i need to maintain a relationship with her/forgive her/love her/ take care of her in her old age... I would love for them to go to the same hell and be trapped in there with the narcs. Can they be granted admission in your hell? Please. Lol
aymvX-OrlS0,"I got a beating when i tried to hug that witch. She yelled at me to stop acting like a freak. I never tried again. When i confronted her as an adult, she replied that she always hugged me. Lol. Turns out she&#39;s going to try to dictate my memories now. No thanks. I&#39;ve got my own. Save your gaslighting for my spineless father."
aymvX-OrlS0,@DeadLittlePunkDoll even some children leave their parents for only enjoying with friends
aymvX-OrlS0,Interesting
aymvX-OrlS0,Somebody should have told my parents.
aymvX-OrlS0,"Garima Heath  it was for 2 minutes, not 10 minutes!  And I am so grateful to have seen this experience even though it was hard to watch"
aymvX-OrlS0,"Raising children is hard!!! It is not easy at all and that is why this world is full of suffering! Suffering is passed from gernation to genration and to others in our lives as well. It is very very difficult to raise children and that it is why we have so many suffering adults, including our own parents who traumatized and wounded us deeply!!!"
aymvX-OrlS0,Fredrick Douglas..... one of my favorite quotes
aymvX-OrlS0,to wrongs don&#39;t make one right<br>same as: two broken don&#39;t make one fixed .
aymvX-OrlS0,@T N It really doesn&#39;t. All our fathers have sinned as well as we ourselves.Also what&#39;s the age demographic for boomers and coomers? I think I&#39;m a coomer.
aymvX-OrlS0,"@William Levy Ok boomer. I&#39;m not even American, my forefathers have made no sins. But you resorting to personally insulting me proves my point. 🤷‍♀️"
aymvX-OrlS0,@elissamarcus soviet union had socialist regime. And do not work for women were a shame. Babies were at kindergarten since very young age like few months. In capitalist America babies spent more time with theirs mothers back then.
aymvX-OrlS0,"@Kingsir da Boss don&#39;t point the finger at feminism, point it at capitalism and American society&#39;s lack of support for families. Look at any other developed country. Favorable work schedules- paid maternity leave up to a year after birth in some places, free healthcare and education. Those are all things that help create a society where people work and parent in harmony."
aymvX-OrlS0,So true and so sad
aymvX-OrlS0,That&#39;s why I never work full time when my kids were young
aymvX-OrlS0,"@Alyssa Cymbaluk Exactly. Ideally, kids would have a parent that&#39;s home with them full time but most cannot afford to. Especially single parents, for them it&#39;s nearly impossible. That&#39;s why it&#39;s important to be thorough when looking for a day-care, talk to the employees, read reviews, talk to other parents and make sure it&#39;s a good fit!"
aymvX-OrlS0,💔 i know how it feels
aymvX-OrlS0,I wish you all the best in getting better.
aymvX-OrlS0,"Bless you, this is what children need. We need to be better for the world."
aymvX-OrlS0,"As someone with Cptsd, in therapy and also 13 weeks pregnant, I&#39;m so incredibly reassured by your comment @Big Red Spot. I&#39;m terrified of messing up my little one but you&#39;ve shown me an alternative path can be taken and what that looks like. So thank you 🙏"
aymvX-OrlS0,@Termination Shock bossy is not the definition of narcissism
aymvX-OrlS0,@Rachel T. but now the media is showing a more aware and caring parent especially since more kids come out LGBTQ parents want to know the politically correct thing to say but all the old school parents wont take head
aymvX-OrlS0,Like fr
aymvX-OrlS0,Same
aymvX-OrlS0,shethewriter i was raised by google who answered all my questions
aymvX-OrlS0,"Not really. Perfect parents are notorious for bringing up little oblivious uncompassionate children. Some people who have been damaged grow up to be the most compassionate responsible people ever. Psychologists tell us we don&#39;t have to be perfect parents. The &quot;just good enough&quot; will do. In fact parents who drop the ball occasionally do make tougher children. In war, the perfectly loved from perfect environment soldiers do worse than those who came from tough neighborhoods with abusive parents. I am sure there is a law of diminishing returns however."
aymvX-OrlS0,"You knew what it was like to have a  bad  childhood, but you had your own and continued the cycle."
aymvX-OrlS0,You have no idea what you&#39;re taking about.    Count your self lucky you never had to go through what the damaged ones survived.
aymvX-OrlS0,"I couldn&#39;t agree more. This video helps those who want to blame their parents and continue their dysfunctional behavior. Everything is actually a habit. One needs to be aware and then try out new behavior. It doesn&#39;t matter if Jesus Christ climbed down off his cross and abused you. In the now, the person is responsible for unskillful feelings. This is a most disturbing video that keeps people damaged. Look at the defeatist remarks. Even autistic, brain damaged, or psychotic people can learn new behavior. TU for posting."
aymvX-OrlS0,@nick san this is a strange thinking on your mum&#39;s side. Too much planning of the family is very much like saying we have control over this matter. Your birth proved them wrong so you can imagine your existences was a continually rebuke to them. She did not allowed for God&#39;s control on the matter.  Heaven looks upon you as a martyr.  <br>So many parents do all sort of rejections on their children. <br><br>The worst of all is when the children carry on the same course  of action and they do most of the time being programmed for it through their own bad experience. Unless they are changed by God the evil only perpetuates through the generations getting worse.<br><br>God bless all mothers because it is theirs to make the world better through raising well emotional balanced children.
aymvX-OrlS0,"Pretty much the same case as mine.<br>Can i tell you my story?<br>When i was a 4 year old boy, my mom told me that she and my dad wanted to have only 2 kids. 1 boy and 1 girl. Their first child was a boy then comes the second one was a boy again, so they tried to have kids for the 3rd time still it was a boy then finally my mom conceive a girl, so now the have 4 kids. 3 sons and one daughter. What a bit shocked me was the next thing she said. She said that after my sister was born they decided that &quot;that&#39;s it we&#39;re not gonna have another kid&quot;. (Which would make anyone assume that they probably started using contraception, i.e. condom or pills.) and so they didn&#39;t expect mom to be pregnant. But i was conceived. And what she said next ultimately put a hole in my soul and doubt in my own existence. She said, &quot;you&#39;re not supposed to be born but since you&#39;re already here, there&#39;s nothing that we can do&quot; .<br>And then it all made sense to me, as to why they are so emotionally absent towards me, and would not give any attention to the things that i value and liked as a kid. i was treated like i was a mistake and an obligation and not a gift., so as if only abortion was legal in my country i wouldn&#39;t be here."
aymvX-OrlS0,"Barefoot Prof ha ha.  Ask many men, my deery, you must be a special woman with special no silent treatment powers. 😂"
aymvX-OrlS0,Why do you attract women who give the silent treatment? You  must need them. I am a woman and have never given anyone the silent treatment. Grow up.
aymvX-OrlS0,Probably because you are an empathetic and kind person and sensing the distress of both baby and mother affected you.
aymvX-OrlS0,"Ah, thanks.<br>A good reminder of this important subject. <br>And so sad to read on how these poor babies died."

aymvX-OrlS0,@Indiana Rose thanks for reaching out. Yes I will. And I&#39;ll be deleting this comment soon.
aymvX-OrlS0,You should find therapy (even on YT) that deals with inner child conflict
aymvX-OrlS0,It happens unconsciously no matter how much I tell myself I won&#39;t. Then sometime after the interaction I realise I&#39;ve been scuppered again.
aymvX-OrlS0,"You can&#39;t and never will. My father is similar. Work at being a whole adult, it is not your job to parent her, you will die trying"
aymvX-OrlS0,I agree. * a lot
aymvX-OrlS0,I&#39;m like you
aymvX-OrlS0,My brother killed himself on his 23rd birthday last year and she truly believes her neglect has nothing to do with it
aymvX-OrlS0,I hope and pray you learnt from your experience how not to parent and rather raised your child(ren) with love. We can&#39;t change the past but we change the future.
aymvX-OrlS0,"@Tina Flintstone Please remember that in reality, you are not alone as long as you know how to call on God through HIS SON, Yahushua HaMashiach.  God loves you so much that HE allowed HIMSELF to come into the world as a human being so that HE can pay for your sins and set you free from all your bondage!  When you develop a personal relationship with God through HIS SON, Yahushua HaMashiach, you will find out that you are greatly loved by God and HE is ALL that you really need!  There is NO mother or father or husband or wife or children or siblings who will love you unconditionally like the Lord Almighty loves you."
aymvX-OrlS0,"I’ve seen videos on family dynamics (narcissism, scrape goats, golden child) and it’s assumed that going no contact you will live happily ever after.  Not true.  Yes, you minimize future damage but there is pain and loss.  The worst part is people you may meet or work with think there is something wrong with you because you have no family support.  That’s what I experienced anyway.  Especially holidays.  You might have a few friends but there are times that are for family only and you are not invited.  You are always an outsider when it comes down to it."
aymvX-OrlS0,"Tina flintstones, Sorry to hear what you&#39;ve been through"
aymvX-OrlS0,"I am so sorry to hear about this. A life that doesn&#39;t give you a moment of reprieve. I sometimes wonder why the world is like this. You must have suffered a lot, and for that I am sorry."
aymvX-OrlS0,Same here Lena. Im about to turn 50 and vowed to never have children who would end up hating me for passing on all my childhood baggage. I also refuse to perpetuate the dysfunctional gene pool of my heritage.
aymvX-OrlS0,Love to you dear one.
aymvX-OrlS0,"That&#39;s what happened to me.  Right after I graduated from high school my dad told me that I had to move out because, &quot;That was the rule.&quot;  I was just 17 an not employed.  My mother didn&#39;t object.  I got a job and stayed with relatives for that summer.  Of course, this &quot;rule&quot; didn&#39;t apply to any of my younger seven siblings."
aymvX-OrlS0,I&#39;m a Baby Boomer who was emotionally neglected. I and my five siblings were all latch-key kids.
aymvX-OrlS0,"Same, that type of cry breaks my heart"
aymvX-OrlS0,"Wendy Bone <br><br>I&#39;m really sorry to hear that. <br><br>People really don&#39;t understand how extremely important raising a child really is. Every little thing you do, (such as ignoring your child) has serious consequences and repercussions. <br><br>Good parents make good kids, which makes good people. And the cycle continues. Plain and simple. <br><br>If you know In your heart, that you will be a bad parent if you raise a kid, then do your unborn child a favor. <br><br>DONT HAVE ONE!"
aymvX-OrlS0,This was my mother during my childhood. I am so damaged.
aymvX-OrlS0,Yea I literally teared up when the baby started crying. <br><br>It may be an &quot;experiment&quot;. But those are real emotions coming from that baby.
aymvX-OrlS0,Mine too... I wanted to sob!! 😢😭
aymvX-OrlS0,@blacbeuti dummy it cant be emotionally rewired
aymvX-OrlS0,@blacbeuti so many great things in your life ...but on video about neglected children talking about you moved on🤔🤔🤔🤔
aymvX-OrlS0,@Aswathy P that&#39;s what they all say
aymvX-OrlS0,@Rain Dance Ranch I notice I  struggle with that recently I&#39;m quick to say their not good friends because they can&#39;t support me but I have to keep remembering that they really dont get it and it&#39;s okay it&#39;s hard tho because when you think someone knows u it should be easy and it&#39;s when u have NOBODY no siblings no cousins aunts or uncles 1 friend who doesn&#39;t get or doesn&#39;t really want to understand  .who gonna have my back its like I have to start my own gang because when u live in the city alone and everyone else&#39;s has rachect families on go I just gotta fend for myself and I  hope the police understand
aymvX-OrlS0,@A Masion u hit it on the head
aymvX-OrlS0,Vanessa Ixaya Barrera That’s wheel of karma.
aymvX-OrlS0,Soytu19 Well said.
aymvX-OrlS0,Soytu19 this dynamic is the root of all violence in the world and all addiction in the world and it’s really just that simple. You can see the anger in the child and how easily as an adult one would turn and abuse substances or use rageful outbursts to try to purge that pent up sense of injustice and frustrating treatment.  That experiment pissed me off and there’s no excuse for what they did even if it was just for a few minutes. You can’t slap a child in the face and tell it that you were just kidding or that it was just an experiment. That woman damaged that child and for what?
aymvX-OrlS0,"Somi C that’s terrible that you had that experience. Your parents don’t sound like the lived what the bible teaches. It says “do not exasperate your children”. If someone is using religion as an excuse to abuse, they’re not actually true believers.<br>If parents get overwhelmed and lash out at their child, it’s their own human nature, nothing to do with religion. <br>I was very lucky to grow up in a Christian home. My parents were always fair and corrected us out of love. I try to do the same with my kids. I try to give fair, non physical punishment because God is love and he wants us to care for our children and treat them with kindness and understanding. <br>Treating someone badly and then blaming it on religion is terrible."
aymvX-OrlS0,"Vanessa Ixaya Barrera until someone wakes up to make a proactive change and some effort to heal, the trauma gets passed on you are right"
aymvX-OrlS0,the problem is that forgiveness is practically impossible for someone who has not had their emotional needs met
aymvX-OrlS0,@gypsy 1999 mrwe1rd_beard. My instagram id incase  you need someone to talk to. I am in all ears pal.
aymvX-OrlS0,"Mark Turner, me too.  I had mine in my life for 25 years before I just cut her out of my life.  Therapists think I had ptsd already as a kid because of the damage she caused. My heart goes out to you.."
aymvX-OrlS0,"I&#39;m so sorry Mark, no one should ever be put through that by either one of their parents."
aymvX-OrlS0,mehul k Dually noted. That’s the attitude I have nowadays. I try not to let others determine how I feel or what I do.
aymvX-OrlS0,@gypsy 1999 <br>Start taking charge of the life positively. How ? By realising that our life our emtions our reactions  our feeling od happiness &amp; fulfillment should not be dependent on others reaction. Put it simply why should I feel better on others reaction. It should be vice versa.
aymvX-OrlS0,Get a grip and stop exaggerating things. Kids are much more resilient than you think. It clearly has a loving mother and won&#39;t be &quot;traumatized&quot; by being ignored for 2 minutes.
aymvX-OrlS0,"Yeah, TWO MINUTES will &quot;traumatize&quot; her baby for life!!! Get a grip."
aymvX-OrlS0,"I have tried that a lot but nothing changed, I am still the loser I am with nasty personality. I can accept that but I keep hurting my family, that is what I really hate about myself."
aymvX-OrlS0,"Anita hj - You should read your post slowly again. How can you talk to yourself like that??. You are abusing yourself. Try this game: every time you think something negative about yourself or about life, you have to think the exact opposite. It doesn&#39;t matter how ridiculous it sounds to you. Keep doing it every time you remember. Then watch what happens to you."
aymvX-OrlS0,Matilda Faltyn thank you so much &lt;3. I&#39;m glad it&#39;s over. I&#39;m happier.
aymvX-OrlS0,Aldana - Thank God it&#39;s all over for you while you are still young.  -- &quot;What doesn&#39;t kill you makes you stronger&quot;.
aymvX-OrlS0,lockleaze - You are spot on!! The early years are the most important. What bugs me today is young mums using pacifiers (dummies). When I was young I remember they were mostly used to silence a crying baby.
aymvX-OrlS0,"It was called &#39;scientific parenting&#39;, the fad of the 50s/60s. Those babies never saw a  nipple. There was a saying &quot;children should be seen and not heard&quot;. Not like today when parents are more user-friendly. Another saying back in those days was the &quot;generation gap&quot; between parents and their teenagers."
aymvX-OrlS0,Truth Seeker - A good man. Must have decided the buck stops here. This is rare as most people default to their abusive conditioning. It takes a pure heart. God Bless him. He already is.
aymvX-OrlS0,NotMostGirls - What made me feel sick was seeing how little time it took for the baby to feel the distress.
aymvX-OrlS0,"White Cat Black Cat - Don&#39;t waste your time even trying!!. The only person who can look after you is you. My ma can do no wrong. It&#39;s no point telling her my point of view because I&#39;m the bad one - by default!.<br>If you get negative thoughts, try this game:  for every negative thought match it with its positive thought. Doesn&#39;t matter how ridiculous it sounds to you. Keep doing it when you remember to. It really helps restore stability."
aymvX-OrlS0,feel bad for baby :(
aymvX-OrlS0,agree
aymvX-OrlS0,Praise God. Amen
aymvX-OrlS0,"Amen sister, only god can touch these embedded wounds that scars so deep."
aymvX-OrlS0,Amen
aymvX-OrlS0,"Im in the same boat bud. Jesus came so we may have life, and have it abundantly. Just have faith in the already finished work of our glorious almighty father, and receive every bit of his goodness and faithfulness. God bless 🙏🏼"
aymvX-OrlS0,Amen
aymvX-OrlS0,"(@brunettesweetie21) as long as she is still given the emotional space she needs to learn to be self-sufficient and not dependent, your daughter has a bright future in her future 💜"
aymvX-OrlS0,"@Fiona Georgakis Emotional stability and independence is incredibly important. If she never received that, she&#39;s imbalanced and seeks that out through other people... it sounds like you did not have good boundries with her and therefore, she does not have good boundries herself"
aymvX-OrlS0,"@Fiona Georgakis If you were never emotionally available or comforting/supportive to her, that may be why she says those things about you and why her life is the way it is..."
aymvX-OrlS0,"That&#39;s funny. I did gave and still do give love and attention to all my kids. I treat my kids with respect and care when they are sick and make sure they have food to eat, clean clothes to wear and everything else in between. I never get time for my self to be me for a second. Yet my oldest child thinks I am a narcissist or  controlling because I was supportive to the needs of her education while in high school and I wanted to make sure she is protected and safe from the lunatics online. Now she is living with her boyfriend. Is pregnant, and has no further degree or interest in education. I was trying to raise her to be financially independent before getting into a relationship and not get screwed over by a man that would use her and God knows what else . Now she is 21 and depends on a man for everything and calls herself a feminist....as far as I know feminist work and earn their money and depend on no one. They are not suckers like my generation and before...where we women had no life outside the household we got into by marriage. 🤯"
aymvX-OrlS0,❤❤
aymvX-OrlS0,Bella Flor don&#39;t worry i don&#39;t have parents either. just sperm egg donor. its a gamble..no one has a perfect life
aymvX-OrlS0,Nah not necessarily
aymvX-OrlS0,"No, never. Some therapy will help you gain some perspective. Like, I learned that I am of my parents but I am not them. That lifted a weight off me and now I apply this to my own parenting and it has helped me tremendously. It is actually amazing to see the silent transformation when you are free from certain blocks. My children are actually individuals with great personalities and the best of all- great unconditional love, from both sides. Don&#39;t lose hope. It can be fixed."
aymvX-OrlS0,Jesus is the answer!
aymvX-OrlS0,"Nah, just put time and effort into actually learning what’s healthy (you know, instead of the act). Good therapy can be a good way to do that, but even simply recognizing simple things, like “Oh, I feel uncomfortable, that’s what that feels like. Why do I feel that?” can be helpful."
aymvX-OrlS0,YTfancol - we have the power to heal our minds and body.   No one has a perfect childhood
aymvX-OrlS0,Deepthoughts Herenow i do both
aymvX-OrlS0,Christine Mott   Try meditation and mindfulness..all we have is ourselves if u think about it. Meditation and mindfulness has cured my anxiety completely and has taught me to become my own refuge in life
aymvX-OrlS0,Deepthoughts Herenow no. I cant .
aymvX-OrlS0,Christine Mott  learn to love yourself and u will find your way. U can heal the inner child
aymvX-OrlS0,Abby Koop same
aymvX-OrlS0,Yesss i see mothers everywhere nowadays on their phones and ignoring their child or giving their child the phone so they don’t bother them so sad
aymvX-OrlS0,"Unfortunately, I don’t have any children. Technically this comment doesn’t apply to me, but my upbringing has been the main contributing factor for why I don’t have any. I’m not financially stable enough as well so I refuse to bring a child into my current situation. My parents had children young and were not financially or emotionally ready for us... growing up I felt like a burden, my Mum raised us (me and my brother) mainly as a single parent, but when my Dad was around he made me feel even worse. I felt unwanted and I always knew we had money problems, the way my parents acted made me feel guilty for existing. I think about having children a lot, I’m the caring/nurturing type and feel like I would be an attentive and loving parent, but I just think it would be better not to have any...I wouldn’t want for them to be disappointed in me if I ended up getting it wrong. I know I’m slightly disappointed in my own parents and I have some resentment towards them and it’s an awful feeling that I am trying to put aside. I wouldn’t like for my parents to have a hand in raising my kids either, grandparents are supposed to be more chilled out with their grandchildren, but I don’t want to risk it...I don’t want them giving them a tonne of rules to follow and make them feel like they cannot be themselves at all, or be made to feel like they aren’t good enough like they did with me. I was always asking (and waiting) for their next orders and for their approval. I have awful abandonment and rejection issues, a fear of failure or doing the wrong things. I went to uni because they were (borderline) happy that I would potentially be the first in the family to go, so I went, thinking it would make them proud...it did but they could not even show me that much emotion, it was short lived and uncomfortably forced. I didn’t get a good job or career out of going. It was an expensive lesson not to do things for the approval of others. I didn’t even want to go, but out of fear of criticism and for some praise I went. I’m currently in therapy for moderate low mood, self esteem issues and high anxiety...my major concern is focusing on rebuilding myself and giving myself permission to actually be my own person. Having said all of this, I don’t blame my parents as blame is not a useful thing, I am my own person (accountable for my own life) and I am really putting in the work to improve my self, my situation and to make something of my life. Sorry fo the long comment."
aymvX-OrlS0,G S I’m a teen💀 no kids
aymvX-OrlS0,I don’t even have kids lol
aymvX-OrlS0,Lol I&#39;m feeding my lil one while watching this.
aymvX-OrlS0,Oliver Jazz -Very well said. Forgiveness is overrated.
aymvX-OrlS0,Absolutely no forgiveness for the female who abandoned her 4 children to an abusive narcissistic bully....
aymvX-OrlS0,How can one repair the past damange?
aymvX-OrlS0,"Who told you that my mother &quot; did the best she could, considering all of her life&#39;s circumstances, and, based on the parenting that SHE received.&quot; ? My mother never lift a finger to do anything to her 4 kids. She beat me for as long as I remember till the age of 19 ! She married my father for status and money and did not want to do anything in return, and SHE KNEW better . She never dress me or feed me or talk to me, gladly we had a &quot;Maid/nanny&quot; to take care of us. On of my brothers committed suicide , she wanted him out of the house calling him trash because he was addicted to drugs. She did not fucking do anything."
aymvX-OrlS0,"Worst advice ever. You have no idea about people&#39;s past circumstances. Do you go around telling people to forgive sexual abuse, violence and neglect too, just to name a few things happening in dysfunctional families? Nobody&#39;s obliged to forgive a thing, especially when it comes to things you were subjected to as a helpless child. I suggest you take your preaching and &quot;I know better&quot; -attitude elsewhere.<br><br>P.S: ...And as someone else already pointed out, it&#39;s not just about the mothers."
aymvX-OrlS0,"you can be a kid again, think of everything you missed out on as a kid and go and do it, being with my kids makes me a kid again, its a mindset of just having fun and looking at the world in a different way"
aymvX-OrlS0,"it doesn&#39;t. i said it did for me for years to help me cope, but i was kidding myself."
aymvX-OrlS0,"I&#39;m right there with you. It&#39;s not forever. The average lifespan is decreasing from about 71, so I&#39;m about halfway done with this prison sentence."
aymvX-OrlS0,"My two cats are super cool, and give me a lot of love. Guess I already a cat lady, also single. Dont fucking care."
aymvX-OrlS0,@joy gonzalez 100 percent agree
aymvX-OrlS0,@Lionssky Blue don&#39;t give up on meeting a man though we need them sometimes.
aymvX-OrlS0,Sweetheart that is exactly how I feel I am 30 years old I&#39;ve struggled with relationships throughout my 20s I have an anxious attachment style because of the abandonment by my mother and the abuse by my father and I also love cats so I might just do that as well I&#39;m so over it
aymvX-OrlS0,you are wrong .The child who received most love from opposite sex parent is the most alpha..others tend to become betas
aymvX-OrlS0,And then you have to send them to school. . .
aymvX-OrlS0,Me too. I cannot risk failing them
aymvX-OrlS0,@Beverly Ho I&#39;m in my 50&#39;s and am still working on stuff in therapy. I still feel like I&#39;m 12.
aymvX-OrlS0,This hits me home
aymvX-OrlS0,I&#39;m sorry
aymvX-OrlS0,😭😭😭
aymvX-OrlS0,"Suzie Lou And I agree. And I’m saying that we act the way we do (mood swings, impulsivity, addictions, rage, etc) because of the childhood trauma. Not saying it’s ok to abuse ppl, just that there’s a lot of misinformation and myths out there like the clinical Psychologist <i>Shrink 4 Men</i> and Paul Elam’s channel who claim BPD is the female equivalent of psychopathy, when in reality there are men with BPD and also it’s nowhere near psychopathy. It’s in the same cluster of personality disorders as antisocial personality disorder AKA psychopathy but it’s not the same. Only some symptoms are similar. I know that abuse is never okay. It’s just hard to regulate our emotions because the amygdala wasn’t formed properly during childhood due to trauma. And btw ASPD isn’t inherently evil, nor is BPD. Both myths."
aymvX-OrlS0,Romana Strasheim they just won&#39;t
aymvX-OrlS0,Don&#39;t think like that. You can create who you want to be. Just be kind and believe in Jesus and he will send the love your heart desires
aymvX-OrlS0,I wish I had something positive to say to you. My dad was money hungry and materialistic as well. He died recently and I barely shed a tear because I felt so detached from him emotionally. I only hope things get better for you.
aymvX-OrlS0,It seems to me that your father needs to be confronted about his behavior and given a clear incentive to examine his own response.  You might find that he is modeling the behavior which his own father indulged used.  He sounds like a miserable person who can&#39;t find a way out of his own misery.  There is bound to be someone out there who will care about you if you can believe in yourself enough to not reject them.
aymvX-OrlS0,u can&#39;t change urself. u are who u are from ur childhood. don&#39;t take advice from me or any other personthat comments. we aren&#39;t therapists and dont know ur life
aymvX-OrlS0,"Sir G you probably cant change people but you can change yourself. Love yourself regardless truly love yourself not in a arrogant way and you will see how things change. Regardless how others act toward you, you have to know you matter in the world."
aymvX-OrlS0,"omg thats my family, the veener of bullshit then the silence and weridness when everyone went away, got my own family now"
aymvX-OrlS0,"I would love to hear a bit of your story, if you don&#39;t mind sharing"
aymvX-OrlS0,"I know; it&#39;s so sad. :( I may not have been clear with my comment, and if that&#39;s the case, I&#39;m sorry. I meant that they never seem to do studies--good or bad--with FATHERS in child/parent relationships; even my child development book admits that this is lacking. It&#39;s as if we only acknowledge mothers as the care-taker, as if FATHERS don&#39;t really exist, let alone matter, in this context: doesn&#39;t that ever bother them? I mean, women get pissed when they&#39;re misrepresented or discriminated against in the workforce, why haven&#39;t we as a society placed more value on a fathers&#39; importance in parental bonding beyond resource procurement?"
aymvX-OrlS0,"My mother was a narcissist too and it was very difficult to detach from her emotionally. For her it was easy, I had already moved to another country. I just stopped reaching out and the communication stopped right with it. Therapy helps a great deal, I’m reprogramming my thoughts, it’s been about 4 years now."
aymvX-OrlS0,"Annette Thomas Annette, Jesus Christ is the only one who can fill that. You are so loved by him. I am praying for you. I love you and your name is beautiful!"
aymvX-OrlS0,I wish I could hug you!
aymvX-OrlS0,Pffff grow up big deal
aymvX-OrlS0,PaperParade Omg I had a similiar experience. Everything makes sense now...

aymvX-OrlS0,You sound like the relationship I have with my mom. Love to you and yours
aymvX-OrlS0,❤️🙌🏾🙏🏾 Great Job Mom!
aymvX-OrlS0,"Daniélín NicG I’m so happy you found the BEST loophole to all emotional damage; humor! It’s funny you say the word, ‘silence’ bc I was just explaining to my daughter how family gossip really awakens old wounds of not having a voice, not expressing negative emotions or positive emotions to defend ourselves. I was spanked if I stated an opinion that defied theirs. I let my daughter argue in a respectful way &amp; I’ll even admit when I’m wrong. In this way, my daughter sees it’s ok to not dominate with the ego or have to be right all the time &amp; it’s ok to relay everything. I’ve also come to realize many parents are simply very...simple, not very smart or aware. Ignorance, lack of intelligence or enlightenment can feel like abuse to young children who don’t realize their parents aren’t very aware or smart, unfortunately, but maybe hilarious to make fun of, at least🤗"
aymvX-OrlS0,"+Mary Moses mary it sounds like your an amazing mum, l was raised in a house of parents who l personally think  werent able to show emotion and controlled alot, l found out later the reasons why they were like this but l grew up in silence, me and my sibling coped through humour films etc, humours so important, lve got my own family to now☺ god bless you and your daughter"
aymvX-OrlS0,"What I don&#39;t get is that if all this is now scientifically proven, why the culprits aren&#39;t being correctly dealt with by authorities....."

aymvX-OrlS0,Thank you so very much! :-)
aymvX-OrlS0,"me too, there was a man who was 102 and he said one of the reasons he lived so long is he never had children."
aymvX-OrlS0,Wow you guys sound so bitter. All kids are not disappointments and annoying. You just believe you would have a hard time bc you don’t know how to parent. It’s ok some ppl don’t. The Puppetmaster dude is a another aggressive MGTOW 😂 I wouldn’t take advice from him about children.
aymvX-OrlS0,same! i will not have another child carry this burden i have lived my life with. i will let it end with me and not be selfish enough to let another child suffer cause i think theyll fill my emptiness when i know they wont. i can only show &quot;love&quot; the way i was shown and its not the one anyone should be shown
aymvX-OrlS0,"@truth hurts Yeah makes perfect sense,Often do they forget how much time and money do they have to waste on their own kids but they dont realize that because they&#39;re brainwashed by society....Hell I wont even allow myself to sleep with a woman either way,MGTOW for life!"
aymvX-OrlS0,Skaz 1 I said that😬

aymvX-OrlS0,That had/has been going for about 8+ years now. Trump has only been in office for a year and a half. Just about every Democrat we have had in the past 30 years has been far more strict on immigration deportation than any other president. Bill Clintons entire campaign was based around. A 6 year old boy was forcefully taken out of our country by gunpoint in the 90s.
aymvX-OrlS0,"Nora Liliannita Yes, every country has problems. They all can&#39;t just flood the US"
aymvX-OrlS0,Omg you are so wrong
aymvX-OrlS0,Nora Liliannita Tell that to their parents who put them in that situation.
aymvX-OrlS0,"Your parents can give you validity and a good strong foundation but they can&#39;t or shouldn&#39;t do everything for you. Children still have the opportunity to make their own friendships, create opportunities outside of the home, face disappointments, rejection, overcome obstacles,  achieve, find love, success and happiness in the big wide world where they will find plenty of adventure and balance. Parents just give the tools to help where the abused, neglected ones will still be trying to find the tools along the way."
aymvX-OrlS0,Parents can be neglectful with or without technology but in many instances technology has made it worse. Just look around you.
aymvX-OrlS0,I was born in 1997 in Africa and during my childhood my parents were very neglectful  emotionally <br>It’s not about technology it’s about the person
aymvX-OrlS0,A terrible parent always blames other things but never themselves
aymvX-OrlS0,Do it! :-)
aymvX-OrlS0,@Brent bee 💔

aymvX-OrlS0,"my first 5 years consisted of verbally physically abusive dad, abused mom, and 3 much older bullying siblings. Oh and sex abuse by more than one predator. Thanks planet earth."
aymvX-OrlS0,I think its 3 years the more we learn about brain development and the scans that can now highlight the brains growth this gives us evidence of the impact of those early years
aymvX-OrlS0,"That is what normally happens to many little souls, the shutdown. What they didn&#39;t show is the after effects of years of being stone walled. <br>  My mother had depression, and she is part English and part  German..both very stoic and stuff upper lip cultures.  I think culture background and personality both play a role. <br>   Now, my mother is 76 and she is trying to have a better connection with her middle- aged children. She used to be very defensive so that I didn&#39;t know how to be honest  with her. <br>   I love her and will do any care for her she needs. She did her best, but only had so much to give. God helped me by smiling at me and I got better. I hope you find peace in your relationship with your mum. You only get one, and she got blessed with a wonderful child."
aymvX-OrlS0,"I studied English, Philosophy and French at a large University but dropped out half way through second year. I&#39;d passed my first year exams but despite sitting down at a desk every night to do my course work I would procrastinate and dream about where I could go on exchange the next year. This persisted until eventually I was overwhelmed with the cycle and it was too late to catch up. I was living in digs in second year and the family was a nightmare. I was also quite isolated as the friends i&#39;d made in first year were mostly erasmus exchange students and had gone back to their countries by this time. It&#39;s a notable recurrence that most of the friends I make and connect with are foreign. Even my closest childhood friends were not from my town. I find it difficult to connect with people these days, or rather I don&#39;t get too attached and believe that they&#39;re just there for the moment and will eventually drift into the past. I don&#39;t feel anything at that thought anymore because i&#39;m used to it now, but it perpetuates my feeling of being fundamentally alone - more so than is inherent in the human condition. After college I moved home, then moved out for a year and a half but am now back to saving up money because i&#39;m going for a lone trip to Canada and NYC for a month which I am very excited for. My mother has been sober for about a year and a half or perhaps more, so things aren&#39;t as bad as they were and my Stepdad has a better boss and better income so the house which seemed to be gradually falling to pieces is improving again. Part of the problem I experience is the sense of constant emotional repression and while I&#39;m saving at the moment I haven&#39;t seen much of my friends in a while because they live where they went to college or in the city I lived in when I moved out of home. I haven&#39;t really had proper romantic relationships. One when I was 21 for an intense month, with a 30 year old alcoholic with two children, whose habits I would not take part in. And then recently at 23, I entertained a real mind-bender. I thought that everything that&#39;d I dared not wish for had fallen into my lap, after all the time I&#39;d spent craving unattainables- but it turned out rotten. How he treated me and spoke to me was really awful, but how I let him treat me before cutting him loose was the thing I most despised in the end. He was a promiscuous fuck-boy with serious emotional issues related to his mother (I think) combined with toxic masculinity and insecurity, and I wondered too if he might be experiencing psychosis, with the way he  spoke at times but anyway, the most surprising thing to me in-hindsight and even at the time- was how much I would knowingly let him manipulate me and let him speak to me such demeaning ways and still give him what he wanted. I just hope that I won&#39;t let this kind of thing happen in the future again. I spend and am comfortable enough spending a lot of time quite alone yet when some prospect of being other than alone comes along it appeals  and if I do accept it in I don&#39;t want to let it go. Kind of...As a teenager when it comes to guys I had t of few obsessions over guys from a distance who either I didn&#39;t know or were really unattainable. These were unhealthy obsessions which I am cautious not to begin again. At the same time I shrug off a lot of admirers, though admittedly a lot of them can be strange. But I&#39;ve gone through a lot of crushes where I&#39;m attracted to someone until they might be interested in me, then it&#39;s like &#39;&#39;Ew no!&#39;&#39; (lol) but even then if they retract their interest, mine can be sparked again. Well that was a while ago but up until recently I was most attracted to people I knew or sensed I couldn&#39;t have, whether they were from somewhere else or had a partner- though they never brought them up. When I was with the last person, rather the second person, I felt I had a block up that I couldn&#39;t remove, probably because I didn&#39;t get a chance to trust him since it was almost immediately that I became sceptical of him. I was very attracted to him but despite all efforts made by both of us my body wouldn&#39;t let go, so I never got the full physical pay-off that he did. It was the same with the first guy though I wasn&#39;t that attracted to him and I didn&#39;t go all the way with him and had expected that that was why. I haven&#39;t been socializing in a while, as I&#39;m saving, but even when I do I don&#39;t expect guys or even strangers I like to be interested in return, though the last guy was very surprised at this, which surprised me, though I was surprised that he was attracted to me. I think it comes from growing up over-weight and with low self-esteem. I&#39;m not particulary over-weight anymore and am working hard to become as healthy as I can.  I don&#39;t know what I want or rather what to expect because I want to become a success in my own right and meet someone who also has ambition but also understanding. Really I guess I would like some genuine love and warmth and perhaps even some security- and the thought of that makes me tear up as I try to concieve of it in reality.I know it&#39;s going to take me a while to achieve in whatever field I end up committing to. ATM  I want to be a songwriter but I encounter a lot of creative blockage due to my constant repression of my emotions.  I&#39;m actually a talented, though almost conventionally untrained singer and have written some songs which I&#39;m working on geting recorded when I come back from my trip. After my trip I&#39;m also going to study online marketing for a year which should improve my employment potential to fund and skills to promote my music projects and perhaps enable me to move to Canada. But if music doesn&#39;t work out  I think I&#39;d like to study engineering. I am interested in many topics and love to learn. I&#39;m often frustrated that I don&#39;t have a better foundation in music. I play a bit of  guitar and get a lot of admiration for my voice but didn&#39;t study it in school or recieve any formal training so can&#39;t study it at 3rd level. I haven&#39;t thought about this stuff in a while because I&#39;m trying to be more positive, focus and look to the future, but it&#39;s in me anyway and I don&#39;t know how to solve it. Whatever is going on unconciously or subconsciously is blocking my creativity and depleting any confidence I have in relation to being able to create or progress. Apologies for this very long comment, as I said I&#39;ve been alone a lot and journaling doesn&#39;t seem to get at things anymore- because I know my story, the story so far anyway and I think that I think because I&#39;ve analysed it before and its possible consequences, it should be fixed yet it&#39;s not. I feel like no one that I would want could understand the situation I come from or the impact it&#39;s had on me. I don&#39;t want to carry the weight of it on me, but the behaviours or unconscious beliefs I&#39;ve developed growing up stunt my self-development so it&#39;s difficult to grow to where I have to be before I can have a new story. Lol, every sentence turns into a new point, I hope this at least that this will have been an emotional cleanse for me. It&#39;s all very self-centred, yes, and my parents can&#39;t be other than who they are and there&#39;s much they&#39;ve done for me and perhaps I&#39;ve just let myself down in every aspect to date and need to  spread the blame onto others. This is just theraputic for me hence why I&#39;ve now been writin for 4 hours.... lol"
aymvX-OrlS0,"Hello Unicorn! Of course you can. You have all the right in the world to do that. But then, you should find a strategy about how to work on yourself to reduce the damage. They have a video on this channel called <br>&quot; How to parent yourself&quot;. Under that video I wrote a list of all videos from this channel that can help us with this. You can take a look at it if you wish. Have a nice day :- )"
aymvX-OrlS0,You can blame bad parenting but it won&#39;t help your situation.
aymvX-OrlS0,"So, I&#39;m not an expert, but it seems to break this stronghold from your mind.  You need to start telling yourself the truth.  You were not unloved, you were neglected (more than likely unintentionally) from an unhappy mother.  How can she mother you, when she was unhappy and damaged and needed mothering herself.  Forgive her."
aymvX-OrlS0,"I’m 32 and just going no-contact with my parents and stepfather now. It’s freeing, and at the same time, devastating."
aymvX-OrlS0,"@Carolina WoodI am 70 years old and I know exactly what you are talking about.  Take a minute or two and read this, please. It might help you somewhat.   I was physically and verbally abused from the time I was 4 years old.  The beatings that drew blood happened EVERY day.  She told me that she wished I had never been born, wished me dead and how much she hated me.  When I was 14, she tried to sell me to a travelling salesman.  When I was 24, I got raped and choked by my boss.  I made the mistake of calling her and asking to come home.  When I told her what happened, know what she said?  &quot;Go home and go to bed, you&#39;ll be alright in the morning, and maybe this will teach you not to ask for it.&quot;   I dropped her then and there, and ended up travelling all over this country, into Canada and Mexico.  I worked at various jobs, all of them honest and legal.  I worked as a maid, a travel insurance salesperson, an auto mechanic, 18 wheeler driver, and the last job was driving a cab in Queens, NY.  Today, I am not afraid of any 2 or 4 legged beast roaming this planet.   Since I&#39;m not able to work anymore, I write a lot.  Putting all of this on paper helps me deal with it.  I&#39;ve not talked to her in many years now, don&#39;t even know if she is dead or alive."
aymvX-OrlS0,"24 is when I began mine. I had a very difficult and abusive childhood. I wear badges from every type of abuse. It was all very confusing. I began letting myself remember and understand those things at 23, maybe 22. Just before I turned 25 I ended up confronting my parents on some of the really light stuff. It caused a hurricane. This gave me a lot of pain because I was always searching for that acknowledgement of what had happen to me, what they did. But I realized that after my confronting them, and them getting really mean, deny, completely ignore, or attack me, I realized that I will not always have someone to acknowledge my pain. Which is a very painful thing to acknowledge in itself... but I am trying. I just turned 25 and I am so grateful I am figuring this out now. I have hopes for a better future. I have hopes that the true me, underneath all that has happened and attached itself on me, will be able to break through and shine like I was meant to. And that all of this will be in the past, but in a healthy forgiven way. That I will be healthy mentally and emotionally and in all aspects... and that I recognize my own abusive or toxic behaviors that I have taken on myself and others and correct them. My dream is to be the best version of myself, and to connect to everyone with love and empathy. It makes me feel so good to see anybody on their way of healing, at any age. It gives me so much hope."

aymvX-OrlS0,"At least you have started the journey. I&#39;m 32 and I have only just come to terms with the life I&#39;ve had. It&#39;s hard not comparing yourself with others because when you do you feel so behind in the game but in reality you are being truly honest with yourself and that&#39;s something most people never do.

aymvX-OrlS0,"The number one &quot;medical&quot; reason I have heard in support of circumcision is to prevent infection.  I find this an extremely flimsy argument.  We don&#39;t pluck out eyes or remove toes to prevent common bodily infections in those areas, so why would we do it in this instance?  Let&#39;s face it, it&#39;s a culturally motivated decision that doesn&#39;t really benefit the child in any biological way."

aymvX-OrlS0,"I work from home as a private tutor and when I have a child, I can stay home with him/her and still work. I’m surprised this isn’t more common. Also, my mother didn’t work for the first 5 years of my life and she was miserable being at home raising me. She wanted to be working and didn’t enjoy being a mother. Some women do not enjoy being mothers but have kids anyway. I’m the complete opposite in that I’m very nurturing and always want to give love."
aymvX-OrlS0,Very bad implications..pressure of work and time in people who were emotionally damaged to start with. Did modern feminism make a terrible mistake?

aymvX-OrlS0,Children who are neglected often don’t learn how to self-soothe. The calming or soothing that a parent might provide to an upset child doesn’t happen so they may “spin out” when upset. Can you think of soothing things you can give to or do for yourself?
aymvX-OrlS0,"I&#39;d give all of you a nice, long hug, just because you all deserve it!"
aymvX-OrlS0,I once got one from a girl i really loved and still do i guess in 2001<br>My first and last hug. Just remembering it sometimes really helps me and if i drive past the school i sometimes just stop and stare at yhe spot where she hugged me. I wished id hugged her back and never let go

aymvX-OrlS0,Crimson Rain Idk brother....if it gets so bad you want to just end it all you should seek help immediately.  Otherwise you should find someone like a psychologist or therapist and talk it out.  You will learn more about your screwed up childhood and the causes of your current state of mind as much of the trauma you experienced as a kid is likely supressed somewhere in your subconscious mind.  At least that&#39;s what my experience with a therapist was like.  Even though there is no real cure for the damage caused by childhood trauma it doesn&#39;t have to ruin your life. I think it&#39;s very manageable through a series of talk therapy sessions in a lot of cases.  I&#39;m talking from experience dude.  Go do this and take your life back from your inner demons. Good luck!

aymvX-OrlS0,I was the third of three girls and when I was 11 months old my parents had a boy and because boys were so rare in my family a lot of the attention went to my brother  and I was always told I would hit my brother with hard things for no reason and my parents would wonder why
aymvX-OrlS0,Brent bee yes why nothing about dads?
aymvX-OrlS0,I&#39;m crippled at this point by it. Forever begging for love even as an adult because I never got it as a child

aymvX-OrlS0,What about dad?
aymvX-OrlS0,What was your mom’s childhood like?
aymvX-OrlS0,"You are so right, include in the list self-sacrifice and suicidal thoughts. Probably there is a plan  to raise empathetic victims and slaves to take care of everybody else like to become carers for their abusive parents and bend over backwards to their bosses so that the status quo remains stable. A little over three decades here to take care of issues. Thanks @shiningdawn"
aymvX-OrlS0,It hurts me that I know I did this a little due to postpartum depression. Staring off in a daze unable to give emotional responses. Heartbreaking.
aymvX-OrlS0,"Empathy does not require abuse/neglect to grow. The kind of empathy that arises from that usually manifests as depression, self-deprecation, and a nearly uncontrollable urge to people please. How long did it take you to resolve those issues?"

aymvX-OrlS0,You were messed up. You are an adult now. You fix whatever needs to be fixed. Habits aren&#39;t your mom any more.
aymvX-OrlS0,"I did the same to my son. It means nothing actually. You lived in a 1st world country. A lot of kids are spoiled and grow up messed up. I am sure it&#39;s more about your options of social life NOW then the your &quot;negligent&quot; mother. I am a cold woman, I was raised under violence and a generalized rejection from everybody in everyplace because I am black. Nobody wanted to play with me in the school. But that was the best part of my life because the others were worse. But I always knew that I didn&#39;t want to have a kid never. I have high IQ so it was easy to me to rethink all women condition since my childhood. I remember I used to feel very sorry for a mommy pig. I still do. I applied that method to my son. But just in the first weeks. Later he didn&#39;t cry for anything and the first years were amazing because of that. He&#39;s a cold boy, but a lot of spoiled boys are cold. We both are cold. I saw he growing up, I was always there for him but never spoiling. Love, kisses, hugs but not treating him like a king. What see about my son is that he is like me, he&#39;d love to be normal and be warmful to people, but we live in a third world, people here are really mean and futile. Even if he was spoiled, believe me, he would feel bored due to the lack of options in our country. Spoiled or neglected, everybody is feeling empty and lonely."
aymvX-OrlS0,"Pia Wangdu It&#39;s a shame that people like Truby should have had such a malign influence on our species (probably much more far reaching than is realised too). These ideas still continue today with controlled crying. I can&#39;t help but wonder just how much damage that one insignificant, ignorant and arrogant man, Mr King did? And others like him. I read a little of what he wrote, he seemed to think a baby was best treated like an inconvenient object!"
aymvX-OrlS0,"Friendly Metroid Around the 1920s (I think) there was a &quot;child care&quot;professional called Truby King. He was very much against cuddling and such niceties and recommended not going to a crying baby, and &quot;holding it out&quot; at timed intervals for a wee. I&#39;ve gathered that he had rather a significant influence on mother&#39;s of the era. I think that might be where that advice originated."
aymvX-OrlS0,"Can you read emotion, body language in others ? Do you even know if you can ? Children of narcissistic parents, {maybe narcissistic themselves} have great difficulty with this.Have difficulty reading others expressions and sometimes get them confused.I wonder if  &quot;still face&#39; has anything to do with this ?"
aymvX-OrlS0,"It’s extremely sad. I’ve seen countless amounts of children being ignored while their parents are on the phone browsing, WhatsApping etc. These children are often asking the most wonderfully curious and childlike questions, with enthusiasm written all over their faces...but then they miss out on important learning and bonding opportunities because the parent/career cannot remove their focus from the device. Heartbreaking. I also hate seeing young children and babies being pacified via mobile phones and tablets while the parents/carers are using their other electronic devices 🤦🏾‍♀️"

Being asexual (not saying you are, but maybe look into that) and not wanting relationships to always be about sex is not a problem. It&#39;s just a different way of being. I&#39;d say, get out of the city. You may find life in a smaller town much nicer. Lots of single people in a small town do more friendship than sex-relationship because everybody knows everbody, so if you&#39;re going to hook up - everyone will know about it soon enough. The culture of anonymous sex doesn&#39;t really exist. Travel the world! In my experience travellers are great company, talk with depth very soon, aren&#39;t looking for a hookup as much, and then they give you a hug and leave.

No &quot;even&quot;. I make the same mistake whenever I say &quot;Not even my mother was capable of loving me&quot;. As in &quot;I am so inherently unlovable that even my mother, the person best suited for loving me, couldn&#39;t do it so no-one ever could&quot;. It was simply my mother, firstly as a person of literally billions in this world and secondly as someone with a personality disorder that keeps her from being able to love, who didn&#39;t love me. It is very well possible that your father doesn&#39;t care about you. But that is not even an indicator for how much other people can care about you. I really hope you understand what am saying and that you ask me about it if you don&#39;t. I care enough about you to really want you to understand that if your father doesn&#39;t care about you, that is ONE person who doesn&#39;t care about you. Just ONE. There may be others that don&#39;t care about you as well but that does not mean that both no-one does now and no-one ever could in the future. Edit: Corrected typo and grammar mistake."

It will open all your emotions linked with them, you will feel it again strongly, so you need to breathe...and deep exhale... <br>It&#39;s also good to watch the process from the position of an independent observer, so you don&#39;t participate in those emotions too much. It&#39;s great technique when you experience something difficult. As the observer you just observe what&#39;s happening in the old memory and what&#39;s happening in your body as a response to that and you let it go. You will see the truth. And when you let the emotions open again and you are aware of them and then you let them go away, you can heal yourself. You can understand what happened and find peace in your heart.<br>It&#39;s not so difficult as it seems to be at the beginning. Some small traumas can be fixed in few minutes but there are also some traumas that can spend more time to cope with it (months of working on it). But it&#39;s always worth it! That&#39;s my experience."

aymvX-OrlS0,@Mystic Miserly That&#39;s an old term coined by Bruno Bettleheim to erroneously blame mothers for autistic children
aymvX-OrlS0,"Zenny Abanales  my father, my husband, my mother and father in law... are all just frozen refrigirator people."
aymvX-OrlS0,remember too that they were very likely on the receiving end of a parent&#39;s emotional coldness
aymvX-OrlS0,Zenny Abanales <br>&quot;Refrigerator parents &quot; so apt the reference to the cold indifference of parents<br>Loved it
aymvX-OrlS0,"I can relate to this so much especially the last few lines<br>My parents have given me everything, looked after me but still on the emotional side our relationship is a dysfunctional one"

aymvX-OrlS0,"@Badboyifier you&#39;d be suprised lol he can always find an emotionally broken woman, tons of those roaming around."
aymvX-OrlS0,Cmon an emotionally damaged guy can&#39;t even find a girl so don&#39;t worry
aymvX-OrlS0,fat guy no more lol niiice
aymvX-OrlS0,CrazyJimmi9 <br>  I just noticed that too..  I will<br>Agree to disagree... Lmao
aymvX-OrlS0,fat guy no more only difference in opinion between our two comments is that I believe you don&#39;t have to have a mental illness* to continue the cycle of abuse or neglect. For instance if the parent never got help or came to any kind of real understanding of their own emotional dispositions then they would most likely continue the behavior with their own offspring out of ignorance instead of spite or mental illness. Generally speaking of course. (*Edit: forgot to type out illness.)
aymvX-OrlS0,It&#39;s never too late to heal.
aymvX-OrlS0,"ah. well, life is not stagnant, friend. it ebbs and flows with your mindset and personal development. and your best days are still ahead of you. just by bringing awareness to the trauma, you have gained a crucial advantage over the situation. and by searching, you will over time accumulate quite the arsenal of tools not only to help you heal but to excel at life. yes, there is post traumatic stress, but there is also post traumatic growth, whereby you will develop skills and insights you otherwise would not have. don&#39;t underestimate yourself. you are only at the beginning of your journey. your ability to rebuild is greater than the devastation anyone else can do. it&#39;s not too late"
aymvX-OrlS0,"Kryptonite I am trying my best to remedy the situation, I was referring to the aftermath of childhood trauma."
aymvX-OrlS0,"that&#39;s tough, buddy. can you define &quot;devastation&quot; for us? i don&#39;t know your situation and i don&#39;t know your history, but it seems to me that being able to handle it all by yourself is of great personal importance"
aymvX-OrlS0,Kryptonite yes I would.
aymvX-OrlS0,Lmao😂😂 I can relate
aymvX-OrlS0,😂😂😂😂😂😂

aymvX-OrlS0,LOL
aymvX-OrlS0,Lmao I was thinking the same
aymvX-OrlS0,"How do you do it? I must know. I now beg my bf for love and feel just like that child all over again who never received love, but the difference is, I am now an adult... 😔"

aymvX-OrlS0,"Im understanding, give hugs, and say I love you to my kids often. Im not a soulless bottom feeder like my parents."
aymvX-OrlS0,@ElcoCanon ben je Nederlands?
aymvX-OrlS0,Wish you all the best dear... you are not alone! Big hug🤗
aymvX-OrlS0,Juliz so you&#39;re saying this with the same authority this assumed data is based on unless it screwed up enough kids up to a point when applied or else the entire theory is suspect. My point is some people are born overly sensitive. Some are born serial killers etc. Etc And it goes the other way too
aymvX-OrlS0,A two minute experiment will hardly scar a child for life. Only if the mother kept it up for years would it have an impact on the child.
aymvX-OrlS0,"Inyourownleague Better than them Still, either kids got screwed up over this experiment or there&#39;s a level or degree at how much this actually matters and the neglect affects someone"
aymvX-OrlS0,"Charles Pickett the clip is from a study saw the same clip in college early 2000s, don&#39;t blame this YT  page"
aymvX-OrlS0,xmifi total depravity- a human condition
aymvX-OrlS0,"I agree, it&#39;s not a matter of either or. And I believe just like nutrition has many aspects, affection has different spectrum too. A grandfather&#39;s affection is not the same as the aunt&#39;s. The richness of affection spectrum is just like a balanced nutritious diet, resulting emotional health."
aymvX-OrlS0,"Ћурђа I don&#39;t want to generalize. I am sure there are wonderful daycare centers where kids get the love and attention they need. Most, however, I think are not ideal places for children. Children can grow up in communities with people of all ages. It shouldn&#39;t be a question of either daycare or only old people."
aymvX-OrlS0,"xmifi Atricial animals have physically helpless young. The opposite are precocious, and have offspring that can move themselves independently shortly after birth and can clearly sense their surroundings.<br><br>Most placental mammals that have complex social structures (and none are more complex than humans!) are atricial. The going theory is that these offspring need extra time to learn how to act as part of their species&#39; social structure."
aymvX-OrlS0,xmifi:  I believe that it gives us more compassion for the pain and neglect of others.  Of course I believe in reincarnation and the multi-lifetime journey of the soul.  Which is honestly a good way of making sense of neglect and suffering if you think your soul is developing and pain is the best teacher of compassion.
aymvX-OrlS0,Hound19745 lets keep politics out of this.
aymvX-OrlS0,"Blame and responsibility are different things.<br>Some people need to be able to recognize things that weren&#39;t their fault so they can forgive themselves for the position they find themselves in. And then they can work on the responsibility bit, you fool."
aymvX-OrlS0,"Hmmmmmmmmm.. yea tell that to people who got emotional neglected since birth, no loving,abusive and sabotaging life. Tell that they have nothing with the blame. Congrats to you who is born on a medium setting in life, but for some we are born in difficulty setting set on Hell, where we cannot escape even if we tried to improve for 20 years."
aymvX-OrlS0,"Definitely not obvious as satire, if that&#39;s what was intended."
aymvX-OrlS0,@Barefoot Prof remember how many families cover up the past though and blame their children&#39;s nature for present unhappiness not their upbringing.Remember how much was hidden away and how children&#39;s upbringing is the parents responsibility not someone else&#39;s.The alternative for emotionally damaged people is to go though life believing it&#39;s their fault.This is a disgraceful lie and it leads to suicide in some cases.Those adults who knowingly neglect and abuse children have a special place in hell ...
aymvX-OrlS0,"Then shut that window. Is the sun shining outside? Did you go to the store and see an adorable child examining a package of noodles like it was some miraculous new invention? Did your dog, cat nuzzle you and look at you with adoring eyes? Did you neighbor bring you some freshly baked bread? Did you pick up a cold woman in the rain at a bus stop and take her to her destination? Fuck the past."
aymvX-OrlS0,"Yes!! and also mention the argument that happen between him and another theologian, Al-Ghazali."
aymvX-OrlS0,Me too!!
aymvX-OrlS0,@Betty Davis Sooooo true!
aymvX-OrlS0,Oh please.....get over yourself. It&#39;s not like she was being tortured. It was for 2 minutes.
aymvX-OrlS0,It was very hard to watch! I thank the mother for her strength in order to prove this theory. I know she took something away from this experiment and shared it. I love babies!
aymvX-OrlS0,same 🙁
aymvX-OrlS0,Please don&#39;t forget. Your parents were once children too.
aymvX-OrlS0,@A43N55JK7 I mean if we suppose to happy with a human incubator they shouldn&#39;t come with rules then
aymvX-OrlS0,@Patricia Githae I keep hearing this same story but no one  told them to open there legs if they upbringing is so bad like does no one actually think before they have children or is it just a pump and dump thing??
aymvX-OrlS0,"@Fred Neecher my mother abused the shit out of me, mentally, physically, heck she gave part of my inheritance to my brother, at 5 years old she put a knife on my throat threatening to kill if my dad didn&#39;t come back...this is a tiny bit of what she has done. I am a mother myself and I am very proud to be absolutely nothing like her. 😁💝"
aymvX-OrlS0,"Why are you bringing up hate? Did the parents hate their children when emotionally neglecting them? Attachment is created in childhood. Later you can lie that children are haters, scream, kick your feet but it&#39;s too late. No one grows new brain."
aymvX-OrlS0,"The perfect answer to all those articles and people who are questioning why our generations aren&#39;t producing children. Why would we? We don&#39;t know how to parent. Like you said, we&#39;re still kids learning to be adults."
aymvX-OrlS0,"Yeah I was beat, belittled, verbally, emotionally, physically abused and the scapegoat of my narcissist father. In and out of psych wards at 18, suicide attempts. A diagnosed alcoholic at 18 to numb the pain and emptiness of my borderline personality disorder. 19 now and life is as shitty as it’s always been."
aymvX-OrlS0,"I&#39;m nearly 40 and I was emotionally neglected by my mother, from since I could ever remember. With time things get better, know your worth and open your heart to love. We didn&#39;t get love...so we know how important it is to love. Try not let history repeat itself, we have the power to be more. Ppl like us. 💗💗"
aymvX-OrlS0,I&#39;m sending you virtual hugs and kisses.  😍❤💘💖💕💓💗❣💟💞💝💜💛💙💚.  I hope you have a good day.
aymvX-OrlS0,Same. I&#39;m so sorry. I am 26 and just realized that ive never hugged of kissed a romantic partner. In fact spent most of my life turning down relationships even though im a romantic. I need to wake up
aymvX-OrlS0,Me too i am 35...my mother was always emotionally distant.
aymvX-OrlS0,Darth Senate  mine too. 😔
aymvX-OrlS0,@Lucky Joestar No kidding!! How ridiculous that Leo McElroy &amp; Shenzie J are so biased.  Unbelievable really!!  Sad also.  Hope you guys aren&#39;t passing that flawed reasoning onto any children you may currently have or hope to have in the future.
aymvX-OrlS0,"I appreciate this as a joke, but only if it&#39;s a joke. I have worked in Scottish social services, there&#39;s the same amount of parental neglect going on as there is in England."
aymvX-OrlS0,Leo McElroy it&#39;s the same case with an Indian mother!
aymvX-OrlS0,"Leo McElroy Yes, there are pushy English parents who put conditions on affection but there are many more who don&#39;t. I came to England as an outsider so view them from that perspective, if anything, the English have a tendency to spoil their kids then expect them to know how to be responsible at some magical arbitrary age. They have their faults but conditional affection for their kids is more an upper/upper middle class thing."
aymvX-OrlS0,You are loved. John 3: 16

aymvX-OrlS0,These videos hit me so hard !!!!
aymvX-OrlS0,"I wasn&#39;t being serious mate, just joking. Of course, there&#39;s more than meets the eye"
aymvX-OrlS0,I remember a lot of things when I was 3
aymvX-OrlS0,@Mark Reid I only have one good memory
aymvX-OrlS0,@Dalin Plaisier Most people tend to remember both good and bad things in their childhood.
aymvX-OrlS0,@Mark Reid that means you had a nice childhood
aymvX-OrlS0,@Venkata Sambaraju That’s what remembering is. If it’s out of reach from my memory then I don’t remember.
aymvX-OrlS0,Nicholas Whiteley  No. It just tells you how important it is to love children.
aymvX-OrlS0,i would say 100 % but it&#39;s easier to say then to do
aymvX-OrlS0,"Manolache Marian Liviu Arrogance isn&#39;t smart but, neither is resentment. Comparing oneself to others is a kind of personal hell that is utterly useless. Play the hand you are dealt to the best of your ability. That&#39;s all life asks you to do."
aymvX-OrlS0,fait <br>I guess your words resonate with the words &quot; Love is for fools&quot; <br>Is that what you mean to say?
aymvX-OrlS0,BigHenFor how do we learn to parent ourselves?
aymvX-OrlS0,"fait Love isn&#39;t a luxury: it&#39;s our core motivation. We are designed to be social beings but, for us to be contented, we need to love ourselves first. We need to have developed care and regard for ourselves,  before we can care for and respect others. Part of that process is to have been loved and cared for in our childhood. Where that isn&#39;t possible, it is our task to learn to parent ourselves with loving kindness, so that we grow up emotionally enough to give and take."
aymvX-OrlS0,Little Spider thats what I said
aymvX-OrlS0,Virtual hugs back.
aymvX-OrlS0,Heres a hug right back!!!! ( gosh i miss hugs)
aymvX-OrlS0,Thanks
aymvX-OrlS0,"@ElcoCanon I cant remember much of my childhood till after 9 years of age. My family and I came  to the USA , from Italy when I was 4. I l have 4 sisters 1 bro. I an youngest and I think my older sisters resented having to take care of me as they were only about 11, and 12 or so. My mom worked as a seamstress,  and dad was a masonry worker and came home only on weekends . So I have no idea who parented me. I suspect some sex abuse from sisters as my parents were very strict and they were not allowed to date. I did counseling seemed to help but not knowing what happened is kinda weighing on me.<br>I am so sorry about what happen to you and will send a prayer,  hope it helps."
aymvX-OrlS0,thanks
aymvX-OrlS0,Thank you for saying that. I needed it
aymvX-OrlS0,Thats the spirit
aymvX-OrlS0,Have fun.
aymvX-OrlS0,- Shooting Starlight - thank you  😊 you’re a kind soul yourself 🥰

7DPhIQh91Mw,"My problem with it is that titles mean nothing.  As someone who&#39;s worked in the special needs department for public schools, I&#39;ve seen some things that go on behind closed doors.  Not saying everyone can&#39;t be trusted,  but if a child isn&#39;t old enough to speak about something inappropriate, it can be taking a risk.  I wouldn&#39;t turn my infant over to someone I don&#39;t know, I don&#39;t care how pretty it looks."
bwpcn8sRtqg,Same.
bwpcn8sRtqg,I&#39;m the adult daughter of a mum with bpd and dad with strong narcissism. She rejected me from young. They both have done lasting damage to me and now my siblings carry on the attacks against me.<br>I feel sorry for your daughter regarding the pain her mother has inflicted. It&#39;s good she has a caring father. Having at least one supportive parent means a great deal x
bwpcn8sRtqg,Surrender to Christ.put all your worries in him dear.Jesus never leave you.’me also separated from my parents from 3year to 15 yrs.then I leAd a hostel life.
bwpcn8sRtqg,"It is true in this video the risk evaluation region in brain is damaged! Scientist! it is true with me, like i quitted my jobs without any lined up several times due to stress at work and wanna something more outside. So clearly i didn&#39;t think wisely and didn&#39;t have any risk prevention mechanism in my brain."
bwpcn8sRtqg,Sometimes it&#39;s more detrimental to hold when the parental foundation isn&#39;t strong.
bwpcn8sRtqg,How about a father and child?!
bwpcn8sRtqg,explain time out
bwpcn8sRtqg,@Tumblelina Truth We need to stick together for our children
bwpcn8sRtqg,@Tumblelina Truth not always the case... i run a support group for fathers and a lot of these men are fighting to see their children but are being alienated from them.
bwpcn8sRtqg,@Jimmy Mane that very true it too bad so many fathers leave their families  and children and force single moms in a hellish Nightmare in poverty working multiple jobs just to survive Not being able to afford childcare! And what happens when Mom gets sick? Or she can’t find affordable housing Good food or have time with her babies between Jobs?!?
bwpcn8sRtqg,The child needs both parents. The father plays a very important role to the child
bwpcn8sRtqg,@Allie are u from America

bwpcn8sRtqg,@Allie it’s fine
bwpcn8sRtqg,@DOCTOR ELECTRIC I’m so sorry 😞
bwpcn8sRtqg,"Johann Rosario, that’s bullshit and I’d be happy to tell you why"
bwpcn8sRtqg,"Bullshit.. I&#39;ve done a lot because i were treated like i am beneath a migrant in Sweden, despite the adoption- whenever i were in a conflict i&#39;d get the blame. <br><br>If a Swedish white girl said i had groomed her on her breast, then the social authorities and the child psychiatry would believe her and write in my journal that i were guilty -even after the police put the case down because of no evidence. <br><br>The psychiatry and the social authorities would still have written that i had done the crime -leading to me being treated like i&#39;m guilty without any chance of defending myself.<br><br>Adopted kids are made the scapegoats by white society.. That&#39;s the reason for the many suicides and the behaviour you describe."
bwpcn8sRtqg,@Mandi RIGHT. YOU DO HAVE NO IDEA WHAT YOU&#39;RE TALKING ABOUT.
bwpcn8sRtqg,@mrnygren2 I have no idea what you&#39;re talking about. I feel you&#39;re trying to read racism into everyone white. That&#39;s nuts!
bwpcn8sRtqg,"Exactly, or from the teenager years and on-wards.<br><br>White people will be intolerant to the different temperament of adopteés. When we are small little children we are all cute. But in the teenager-years we are easily made scapegoats for every conflict started by whites in school. <br><br>As in my case, with the Swedish psychiatry demonising me.. I got marginalised from the day i moved out from the family home.. From age 19 to now, and i&#39;m 30 in a month.. <br><br>They placed a Guardian on me ten years ago, they never did listen to me, they did however listen to all the people i had a conflict with- we have zero rights against white Swedes. I&#39;d say this video is just a white woman blaming the separation for the consequenses of being chosen as the scapegoat in a white society.<br><br>I have nothing against most white people.. But when 10 racists attack an adoptée the authorities usually pick their side, then they sweep the racism and bullying under the carpet- and say we are autistic etc instead. Blaming the separation is like protecting their own country from guilt."
bwpcn8sRtqg,@Daniel-  CHILD SEPARATION was not implemented until Jeff Sessions under TRUMP. Housing children with their parents is far better that a separating a toddler or child for 24 to 48 month. Maybe this should happen to your child in an undisclosed location where Jimmy Savile the custodian can hold her on his lap and whisper some sweet grooming into her ears.
bwpcn8sRtqg,"You realize that this was happening under Obama and no one batted a fucking eye, right? As to the alternative, would you rather the children be jailed with their parents? That&#39;s objectively worse than them being kept in facilities where they&#39;re given food and water and education and recreation"
bwpcn8sRtqg,"...ponder no more, that&#39;s affirmative!"
bwpcn8sRtqg,wow! now you&#39;re getting it!
bwpcn8sRtqg,lol i kinda realize how i miss mom when im in school as a child lot time it creates anxiety because a lot of teachers are terrifying
bwpcn8sRtqg,"Schools actually are pretty destructive, especially for young children. It&#39;s a prison system."
bwpcn8sRtqg,"NO, you simpleton. School is a nurturing environment where a parent returns at the end of the day. You do remember school don&#39;t you?"
bwpcn8sRtqg,"Don&#39;t you know that children must be coddled throughout their entire lives so they never have to face any form of hardship however minimal? Sure, they&#39;ll never learn how to live independently in the future, but at least they didn&#39;t have to cry for the first few days of school..."
bwpcn8sRtqg,"And what about all the children being separated from parents by divorce, illegally by child services and the corrupt family courts who are only in it for the money? <br>There’s a bigger picture here and it’s not just at the border. <br>It’s part of the governments way to manufacture breakdowns in society because they’re deconstructing the family unit."
bwpcn8sRtqg,Truth
bwpcn8sRtqg,Fleur Bandito The alternative is sometimes far worst. Hence the reason to risk everything even for a single chance to be free.
bwpcn8sRtqg,make me--It&#39;s incredibly inhumane to put a child in danger by illegally entering a county through the desert. People die trying to cross.

fyO8pvpnTdE,@Peter Kim damn straight

fyO8pvpnTdE,@Tresno Nugroho Strategy I learned as a kid… gather your own friends or allies to help you<br>See what I mean?
fyO8pvpnTdE,"Sure, fist fight bullies who taller, stronger, richer than you are and oh, there are five of them..."
fyO8pvpnTdE,There are parents that are both abusive and over involved<br>They become over involved in their child&#39;s lives because of fear they will make mistakes
fyO8pvpnTdE,Noted 👍👍
fyO8pvpnTdE,I find the former extreme but the latter seems reasonable
fyO8pvpnTdE,"@BranislavD Thank you for your suggestions, I&#39;ll definitely consider them."
fyO8pvpnTdE,"@Tra O I understand everything you said. It&#39;s not only beating that traumatizes the child. Conditional love (eat the soup or you won&#39;t get the cookies after lunch) is also a trauma. When the baby cries and mommy isn&#39;t there to pick it up, it&#39;s also a trauma. Imagine how many times we&#39;ve been traumatized as children in formative years. It&#39;s brutal. Long story short, I sincerely advise you to watch professor Sam Vaknin lecture in Budapest Narcissist: there&#39;s nobody home (in the first 30 minutes or so he explains how children react to these traumas and how they form defensive mechanisms in adulthood, it&#39;s brutal), also a strong recommendation, Dr. Gabor Mate, everything you can find from him. Nothing will be the same after you watch these, and unfortunately, it&#39;s not a popular topic, if you dive into it, you&#39;ll find out why."
fyO8pvpnTdE,"@BranislavD Probably what you said is true for majority but on my behalf, I don’t want to beat my future children. I have a very good example of how not to be. Thank God I’m self aware, aware of my trauma, my emotions, and working my way to solve it. When you as an adult can’t explain sth to your child, it’s not child’s fault. If you are not in control of your emotions, again, no one is responsible for it and especially your children, so I definitely don’t want to raise my kids that way."
fyO8pvpnTdE,"Abusive parents create abusive children. When child is abused, in its mind the child solves it like this:&quot;When I grow up I don&#39;t want to be the weak, I want to be the strong, I don&#39;t want to be the victim, I want to become the abuser. I want to become like my parent(s)&quot;."

fyO8pvpnTdE,Show her this video
fyO8pvpnTdE,What does political correctness have to do with any of this?
fyO8pvpnTdE,"The fact that you are AWARE enough to notice each child’s individual needs for boundaries &amp; support is AWESOME! <br>Also, I notice you didn’t argue the limitations of your own parents, but maturely access your inner strength as it aligns with each individual child is really telling about who you are as a person &amp; as a parent. It’s rare to find healthy, integrated individuals, who observe their environment &amp; respond in strength accordingly, while acknowledging they are not alone, their actions effect- therefore the they are affective in their interpersonal relationships, with others &amp; with self. <br>We need less “blankets of blame” &amp; more awareness &amp; use of our intuition- for happiness of self &amp; healthy community to think for themselves. <br>I’m guessing your children witness each child is unique &amp; you are aware of who they “be”! How lucky they are to have you &amp; your available “listening”/observing who they are as well☸️🆔⚛️☯️💟☮️🕉💞"
fyO8pvpnTdE,Well said 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
fyO8pvpnTdE,"Universally authoritative parenting (NOT Authoritarian)  is the best parenting even statistically speaking. Being able to give your kids disciple but a combination of empathy, freedom and privacy is essential. One things for sure hitting your kids Is NOT a good idea in any kind of parenting."
fyO8pvpnTdE,It seems like working with a public full of different people needing different approach while society treats us all the same. No wonder we call society broken and unfullfilling.
fyO8pvpnTdE,"It&#39;s best they take a personality test, and Big 5 is best. Not MBTI because their functions probably aren&#39;t fully developed."
fyO8pvpnTdE,Also this type of parenting style doesn&#39;t make the kid behave better. It just makes them more sneaky. They&#39;ll grow up to be anti-social deviants who are simply better at hiding their delinquency
fyO8pvpnTdE,"A lot of times, &#39;talking back&#39; is really just what parents say whenever their kid brings up a valid point that the parents don&#39;t want to address."
fyO8pvpnTdE,I&#39;m so happy for you to be sober and doing well with your children.
fyO8pvpnTdE,"I got the exact same but with a touch of neglect on both sides, they love me to death but I still depend on my mother for most daily tasks at 17 so something clearly went wrong lol"
fyO8pvpnTdE,I got the same type. I can&#39;t complain! :D
fyO8pvpnTdE,😔🙏
fyO8pvpnTdE,"Same my parents both have very demanding jobs, the neglect is just a fact of life"
fyO8pvpnTdE,"@R B it were basically the same finding as in this video: when parents are authoritarian (much control, little comfort/love) it is just as bad as being neglectful (little control, little comfort/love). But the socio-emotional development differs a lot: children from authoritarian parents tend to have high anxiety and depression levels and are rather introvert in their behavior, while children of neglecting parents tend to have mor anger and raging behavior, thus be more extrovert in their behavior. Authoritative parenting, where both levels of love/comfort and control (but in a way the child understands) are rather high, the children had much fewer mental and behavioral illnesses when they grew up."
fyO8pvpnTdE,Which did you discover as best to worst? 😅
fyO8pvpnTdE,I ended up copying the same behavior of my older sister though i promised last year that I won&#39;t end up like her. In my senior year but i can&#39;t use stress as an excuse :/
fyO8pvpnTdE,I hope you are doing well❤️😞
fyO8pvpnTdE,Feel*
fyO8pvpnTdE,how so?
fyO8pvpnTdE,Kinda same :0
fyO8pvpnTdE,Oh and also I don’t have kids of my own but I think if I did I would probably end up being like 5. I noticed that when I was trying to have my youngest nephew read to me last week. But in any case I don’t think or plan to have any kids of my own now or in the near future bc I don’t want them near the hands of my parents. Ever.
fyO8pvpnTdE,"@Jessica Abud haha yeah it seems that often is the household dynamic. And hey, if you think he’s going to just complain about you at counseling then you can complain about him too 😉. It’s a chance to share each other’s perspectives with an outside person."
fyO8pvpnTdE,"LOL!   Your wife sounds like me.   I am not strict with the kids and my husband hates having to be the bad guy.  Also, we have never gone to counseling but I&#39;m pretty sure it would just be him complaining about me.   😮‍💨"
fyO8pvpnTdE,"Not trying to pity you but hope wherever you are from, things eventually turn out better for you. At least you have a good view and understanding of what&#39;s happening. That&#39;s appreciable. Stay blessed :)"
fyO8pvpnTdE,"Be true to yourself, and you&#39;ll make the right decision."
fyO8pvpnTdE,Then make the adult decision and don&#39;t have children. Have the cycle of abuse end with you.
fyO8pvpnTdE,"My birth father was a professional abuser. <br>I&#39;m nothing like him at all.<br>God does mightily in those who are willing to change the generation.<br>Generational curses is a lie . That is where the fear comes from. I&#39;ve felt it and have had to battle through it, but victory comes when you draw the line in the sand and decide to do whatever it takes to provide the healthy and loving environment everyone needs .<br>If you generationally choose to follow in the footsteps of a parent that would be a choice but it doesn&#39;t have to affect the next generation.<br>As for me.... I serve the Lord Jesus Christ and have chosen to give my husband, children, and myself a  home filled with love, mercy, and grace."
fyO8pvpnTdE,@Ann well i am not only in a familly of screamer but also on physical abuse
fyO8pvpnTdE,You&#39;ll do fine. I came from a family of screamers and never did that to my child. You&#39;re already on it.
fyO8pvpnTdE,Permissive at all doesn’t work. My sister in law lays down rules and even provides some discipline but the kids get what they want too much and they are disrespectful brats. I am very concerned with their drive to get what they want ever increasing as they get older that they will be parasites in every relationship and career they have.
fyO8pvpnTdE,@KingKlaus21 anyways one big slap of honesty to me
fyO8pvpnTdE,"@KingKlaus21 Not yet,but my mom is there to help me,I think...:("
fyO8pvpnTdE,"Maybe parenting isn&#39;t for you.  Don&#39;t neglect children, and please don&#39;t plan to do so."
fyO8pvpnTdE,"Question is Why? Don&#39;t stay in this 3rd relationship either! You&#39;re lying to yourself. Did you ever think you&#39;re OK to be alone? Sounds like you don&#39;t like you. Its ok to let go and let God heal you.Yes your family,mom and dad were<br>wrong, you deserved attention,respect and no completion from other family members. You deserve to not hide behind any man. Be free.God loves you!:)!"
fyO8pvpnTdE,"You are worth every beautiful thing in this world and more, you deserve love and attention and admiration, and I think you are so strong for going through everything and deciding to make yourself a better person for future relationships, never stop self improving. I believe you will find the perfect one. If I could give advice, I&#39;d say communicate that you desire more affection from your significant other, also try to make plutonic, but close friendships, go outside your comfort zone to reach out to others. I&#39;ve developed anxiety, and now it&#39;s much harder to talk to people I don&#39;t know well or be with my friends then it used to be, I think we&#39;ll both learn and grow. I have hope for both of us Karrie."
fyO8pvpnTdE,"Correct me if I am wrong, but isn&#39;t Asia known for authoritarian parenting?"
fyO8pvpnTdE,I think I know what youre saying about the toddlers part but can you elaborate?
fyO8pvpnTdE,"They believe it&#39;s stupid because they were helicopter parents (literally constantly with him, even when he had cross country practice they waited at the school for 2 hours) and just did everything for him. He was definitely insecure about making his own decisions and being away from his mom/me for the first 2 years after he moved out of their house. I&#39;ve since broken him out of his shell and he&#39;s been way more independent and has made some wonderful choices."
fyO8pvpnTdE,"That&#39;s kinda how my husbands parents were. They told me that it&#39;s stupid to teach my son how to do basic things like handling money/bills, filing taxes, fixing things around the house, making appointments, etc as a child but they get mad when my husband (their child, 22 years old) can&#39;t do those things? Like duh, you thought it was stupid to teach him those things and now I have to do it myself 🤦🏻‍♀️"
fyO8pvpnTdE,@ssansu that is very encouraging! I am so glad that there are others who were able to pull out of their upbringings and be better for their children.
fyO8pvpnTdE,"You can do it! A close friend of mine had an authoritarian abusive parent, and she worked hard to learn to be a good parent to her own kids. All three kids are in their 20s now and really great kids."
fyO8pvpnTdE,Your already on the right track cause your trying to be a good parent 😀
fyO8pvpnTdE,Good luck
fyO8pvpnTdE,Just caring makes you better. ❤️
fyO8pvpnTdE,"@DM Grimes Pleasure, I wish you the best of luck!"
fyO8pvpnTdE,@KY SH thank you.
fyO8pvpnTdE,"@DM Grimes I’d advise you to try and move out of your parents house when you become an adult and be independent, outline the skills (interpersonal relationships and emotion regulations etc) that you lack of and work on them. <br><br>Make sure you work hard on building a strong support circle. Avoid alcohol and drugs at all costs, focus on yourself. Parents are humans too, they all make mistakes in child upbringing so maintain positive relationships with them and don’t burn bridges (unless they are toxic).<br><br>If this becomes too challenging, you should seek for professional help from a psychotherapist."
fyO8pvpnTdE,"Oh no...<br>Is there a solution?<br>My mother is over-involve,<br>My father is neglectful,<br>And I am always anxious about everything."
fyO8pvpnTdE,@Sprouts Thank you😊
fyO8pvpnTdE,Yes
fyO8pvpnTdE,same!
fyO8pvpnTdE,dude that’s literally my parents except swap it around- my mum has teh abuse/fear solves every problem and my dad is the “imma pretend nothing happened”
fyO8pvpnTdE,Same
fyO8pvpnTdE,That was my bad and stepmom
fyO8pvpnTdE,L
fyO8pvpnTdE,She never was able to choose even simple things like food thats definitely decent video
fyO8pvpnTdE,because it is
fyO8pvpnTdE,@Jelena Babic just answer the question or don&#39;t 🙄
fyO8pvpnTdE,"That is a helicopter parent, they say it in the video."
fyO8pvpnTdE,"Helicopter parents fit that description, yes."
fyO8pvpnTdE,If you watch the video to the end it’s the fifth style
fyO8pvpnTdE,Agreed.
fyO8pvpnTdE,Hate it toooooooo hiks
fyO8pvpnTdE,what? are you implying a 7 minute video on youtube is simplifying the whole concept of childhood? no way.
fyO8pvpnTdE,"Parents don’t always treat their kids the same either. The parents could change styles or change what they do in other ways. My mom was super strict with my brother. Made him go to church every Sunday and made him do chores. She was a lot meaner. Overall, she was much more strict with him. She was still authoritarian with me, but she did become more lax over time so she and he says anyway. <br><br>I still got the “ I’m the parent, you’re the child” or “children have no rights” or “if you hate it here, go get your own place, go ahead, run away, I won’t look for you” etc. My childhood was most like Sara’s in the video. It was still different from his childhood though. She had us 10 years apart. <br><br>There were things she couldn’t do with me. Like she couldn’t take me to church and I couldn’t really do chores for a long time. When I finally could, I did some chores, but they weren’t a regular always required kind of deal like they were with my brother. I didn’t have a life where I came home from school and did the dishes because that’s just what’s expected of me. It was more like I felt like it so I did the dishes or mom noticed they needed done and told me to do them."
fyO8pvpnTdE,"That&#39;s true, but a lot of times a child&#39;s personality can be molded by both the parenting style and the environment they grew up in"
fyO8pvpnTdE,Can u pls tell me.. hows ur parents raised u as well as u feel till now
fyO8pvpnTdE,Poor kids
fyO8pvpnTdE,This should be top comment.
fyO8pvpnTdE,"Absolutely!! Both of my parents operated way differently. My mom was super strict and emotionally unavailable. My father (recovering drug and alcohol addict) was the authoritative parents who suffered from personality disorders, yet I always looked up to him and loved him the most. Even when he had episodes it was something about the structure of freedom he gave me to make mistakes. Then explained to me all the possible outcomes and let me see the error of my ways. I didn&#39;t start loving my mom until my father died when I was 20yrs old."
fyO8pvpnTdE,To talk about combinations can complicate things though. You may think the analysis is not complete but it is complete. Its like the situation where people will say &quot;what about this case and that case&quot;. Its not the norm and you would view it by case to case basis and take qualities from each to make a conclusion.
fyO8pvpnTdE,"This is just the overall style. Each parent can have their own style, but studying the tension between the two and how they affect the children is a complicated longitudinal case study."
fyO8pvpnTdE,Not everyone has two parents
fyO8pvpnTdE,Very good point! I didn&#39;t even think about that but that&#39;s 100% accurate.
fyO8pvpnTdE,"They meant that many Asian parents tend to use the Authoritive style of parenting so they represent Asians. Yes, even though you want something when you were a child, your parents give you what you like because your parents may be or may not be an Authoritive parents. And as someone who&#39;s Asian just like you and came from the Philippines, yes i have an Authouritive parents that is so strict that i&#39;m not allowed to go outside with friends just to eat in a restaurant/fast food chain and just have fun in the theatre. My Authoritive parents reasoned that i might get a bad influence from my friends and that i should just stay at home, the question now is what did the result of it as a growing teenager? I don&#39;t know how to approach people when i really need help, make friends or either just talk to them. I can hide my feelings so easily, never let them know that i&#39;m in pain because they will give me a long lecture to how i didn&#39;t payed much attention to what i&#39;m doing. Like seriously, is it really something that i could control if i&#39;d catch a common cold? I don&#39;t think so. The last time i told them that i&#39;m in pain and i really need emotional help was i&#39;m at the age of 16 and what did they do when i was crying? They are angry at me, my dad threatened me if i could go cry any longer, he would hurt me and he reasoned that i should stop crying and be obedient because you are no longer a child, it pains me because from all those years and crying by myself, i only cried at the age of 16 year old infront of them. In conclusion, Parents needs to give their children a little bit of freedom, to teach them on how to be independent and they could stand up on their own when they faced problems, to enjoy life and to give meaning of it and not trusting your own children. When Parents really knows their child and the child knows what&#39;s wrong and bad, should they just feel imprisoned in their own houses...? It&#39;s hurtful when parents doesn&#39;t know the point of view on their children. Cheers, ma&#39;am."
fyO8pvpnTdE,:(
fyO8pvpnTdE,Sometimes their authoritarian
fyO8pvpnTdE,i come from like a strict household and i plan to do the same try to make their life a bit easier
fyO8pvpnTdE,facts
fyO8pvpnTdE,"im 23 and my parents still try to control me. when i spend my money on the things that ive been wanting for so long, they&#39;ll nag me and try to control my spendings, even though it&#39;s my own earned money. too bad for them, ive grown up to be stubborn and unreliant on them."
fyO8pvpnTdE,Yeah regular abuse and control is accepted in our society yet condemned by psych.
fyO8pvpnTdE,You&#39;re not an adult. You&#39;re not a kid. You&#39;re a teenager. Try to look at it from their perspective. It&#39;s not up to them to see things like an adult. Use your parents&#39; struggle with you as an example.
fyO8pvpnTdE,"yes. exactly. it&#39;s like they clip your wings, then want you to grow new feathers in just a month."
fyO8pvpnTdE,Ah but when you&#39;re an adult... you see that teenagers want to be treated as adults until they&#39;re disciplined.
fyO8pvpnTdE,My mother is like this and now my life is completely fucked up because of it...
fyO8pvpnTdE,I am not a single child tho....
fyO8pvpnTdE,"Yeah, or neurotic parents tend to have neurotic children. It&#39;s almost like they share half there genes or something."
fyO8pvpnTdE,Geez ... my mum was like this. Now I understand why everything seems so hard.
fyO8pvpnTdE,There are many reasons parents have only one child. That doesn&#39;t mean they are bad parents
fyO8pvpnTdE,@Renata Melo <br><br>I was going to write the same thing because I’ve seen successful come from parents who were crackheads and I’ve seen children who become adults who fail in life and they come from parents who did not fail in life.   It comes from interpretation in one’s mind and what one is capable of even thinking some people don’t even think straight.
fyO8pvpnTdE,You either become like your parents<br>Or just become the complete opposite
fyO8pvpnTdE,@M i n t y j e l l y ^^ yes
fyO8pvpnTdE,True
fyO8pvpnTdE,@hypstermyster how do you define projecting?
fyO8pvpnTdE,"I think you&#39;re probably projecting a bit, not all parents are balanced out, some can be pretty extreme in any one category."
fyO8pvpnTdE,😂😂
fyO8pvpnTdE,Please 😭I have the same problem as Nora and that&#39;s my name 😭 I feel attacked
fyO8pvpnTdE,@Dragondude30 I 100% agree... it should be called the &quot;Encourage/Supportive&quot; type.<br>Or something similar.
fyO8pvpnTdE,@David A. I feel like they should really change the names of “authoritarian” and “authoritative”. It causes too much confusion.
fyO8pvpnTdE,@Kyle Roberts Read my post slower. <br><br>I didn&#39;t say that I raised my children &quot;Authoritarian&quot;...<br><br>I said &quot;Authoritative&quot;<br>Totally different. And if you are trying to say &quot;Authoritive&quot; is bad. Then please provide a resource.<br><br>This is how communication issues happen.
fyO8pvpnTdE,Doubtful. Authoritarian has proven to be the least successful parenting style. Let a stranger judge. Parents will be the first to say their kids are awesome. I&#39;m willing to bet they aren&#39;t.
fyO8pvpnTdE,I appreciate it
fyO8pvpnTdE,"@ariane ponicelli No, authoritative was the best. Authoritarian and neglectful are the worst types. It’s not good to be overbearing. Too controlling so much so that your kids suppress their emotions and grow up to not know what they want. It’s not good to make your kids anxious and not confident in themselves. I know for me that parenting style also caused me to be secretive. I didn’t tell my mom anything even when I should’ve. I didn’t go to her with my problems until it was too late or she found me out herself. I kinda hate her to an extent because of her parenting style."
fyO8pvpnTdE,@Souven Tudu idk if you saw the video but it&#39;s the best one out of these 5 types
fyO8pvpnTdE,"When I was young, the limit was 30 minutes a day, plus 15 minutes of typing practice. I have autism, too, and I thought it was a good amount. At the same time, we were homeschooled, so we didn&#39;t have a really busy school or social life requiring a lot of recovery time -- we already got to do our schoolwork alone if we liked, and we read and drew a lot. So screen time was not our only &quot;down time.&quot; Part of the idea of having a screen time limit, I think, is so that kids have time to get bored, so that they can ultimately be more creative, free, and relaxed in their down time."
fyO8pvpnTdE,"I suppose other kids would probably be better off with less screen time than I had, but I still think 30 minutes a day is really short."
fyO8pvpnTdE,"​@Tom Kelly I have autism, so I needed a lot of downtime to recover from how much school and life in general overwhelmed me. I also get fatigued more easily because I have dyspraxia, and am an only child with a chronically ill mother, so I had to entertain myself a lot of the time, living somewhat isolated in the countryside, though there certainly were playdates. I think it&#39;s what I personally needed at the time, but now that I&#39;m older, I&#39;m glad I&#39;ve managed to become much more involved in socialization, exercise, enjoying nature, working on my goals and hobbies, and other things in a good balance with screen time."
fyO8pvpnTdE,"Was that a succesful strategy in your view?<br>It sounds like way too much screen time to me, spending more time in nature and with friends would surely help"
fyO8pvpnTdE,"Best comment of youtube- i 100% agree.<br>Its a ‘me me me ‘ generation, how do i feel, what do i want to do, why doesnt the world just love my lazy narcissistic self’ etc etc …. Not all are like this ofcourse but more and more are"
fyO8pvpnTdE,also mom is passive aggressive
fyO8pvpnTdE,That was the narrator bias
fyO8pvpnTdE,@Crab_ StriKeR nah that&#39;s the same as permissive which is bad (take it from someone who&#39;s like Peter) but as long as you&#39;re not spoiling your child then yes I agree parents should let their kids choose their own career path and support them in achieving their good-hearted dreams.
fyO8pvpnTdE,Actually libertarian is easily the best. It lets the child decide what it wants to be and gives the necessary tools to grow. However the only issue if that it relies on the child&#39;s nature.
fyO8pvpnTdE,"@Dancing Bears yeah, but it&#39;s so common that it could as well be both<br>a criminal parenting style<br>we should talk a bit more about it, like, even to help children that suffer that… talk"
fyO8pvpnTdE,That’s not a parenting style that’s a criminal
fyO8pvpnTdE,Asian not only the chinese
fyO8pvpnTdE,Some Mexican families do that too sadly.
fyO8pvpnTdE,My parents are the over-involved ones and they are Asians
fyO8pvpnTdE,Yeah it hit me deep somewhere inside 😞😪
fyO8pvpnTdE,"It is hard because they both come from different family backgrounds and the father is very authoritarian he likes the kids ready for bed by the time he gets home from work, the house looking reasonably tidy and the mother who has 101 things to do might panic, especially if he catches her off guard by finishing early.  The mother will feel resentful and it will affect her mental health especially as he doesn&#39;t offer to help and disappears off to the computer"
fyO8pvpnTdE,The same thing happened to me! I used to feel jealous of my younger brother cuz his feelings &amp; emotions were respected. My parents used to constantly ashame and scold me for my jealousy.
fyO8pvpnTdE,"@Silias Porter  They love you. It&#39;s ok to take stuff off your plate and put it in the crock pot for later when things calm down a bit. I&#39;ve done that quite a few times and everything worked out just fine .<br>Parenting is hard, being a kid is hard.. <br>When things get too much in my home I just sit with each of my children ( one at a time) and talk with them and try to connect with them emotionally.<br>May I suggest that you write a card to your parents letting them know you love them and miss them?<br>They might be so overwhelmed with adulting that they missed the mark.<br>I hope that encourages you and helps you."
fyO8pvpnTdE,That&#39;s incredible character! Way to go!
fyO8pvpnTdE,"Silias Porter you’re doing an awesome job!! I am proud of you as a member of the society ! I wish there’s more responsible people like you!  I suggest you write them a letter telling them how you feel,. Something to learn early in life is to communicate your feelings and clarify everything ."
fyO8pvpnTdE,@Jena Cide It was when you realize every second/minute reading YouTube comments like that is absolutely waisted on something that doesn&#39;t give you anything and that you don&#39;t even enjoy.
fyO8pvpnTdE,I feel like my parents are the same..
fyO8pvpnTdE,Without more information its impossible to know for sure but what you are describing sounds like both your parents are narcissistic. Demonstrating a lack of empathy especially for something as difficult as dealing with depression is a dead give away. There&#39;s no positive upside to them to care and help you through it so they don&#39;t bother. Just my opinion though having grown up with a narcissistic mother.
fyO8pvpnTdE,very insightful and introspection. i wish you the best of healing and love on your journey.
fyO8pvpnTdE,Our case is very similar
fyO8pvpnTdE,"@Double V Sounds very manipulative, but you sound like a dandelion kid, meaning you rise and shine even in the toughest enviroment. Keep listening to yourself and not him, unless it serves you to listen to him, but don&#39;t take what he says to heart!"
fyO8pvpnTdE,You really are lucky 😩
fyO8pvpnTdE,@Rūsī yeah that comment threw me off. Maybe they mean they were taught to be respectful and learn how to be cooperative and not the “bad child” in social settings. You know the kid that obviously has home issues. Maybe they mean taught how to be a solid member of society by being respectful
fyO8pvpnTdE,Giving in to peer pressure is a good quality to have?
fyO8pvpnTdE,"lucky for you, while others living with a authoritarian violence parents, like my family"
fyO8pvpnTdE,Luckily you weren&#39;t surrounded by people who called your parents monsters. The attitudes of other parents can change how a child views their family.
fyO8pvpnTdE,So true!
fyO8pvpnTdE,Disagree to some extent. I think parents should be their children&#39;s &quot;first&quot; heroes but not there only.
fyO8pvpnTdE,I don’t think that’s a choice. Kids just see their parents that way
fyO8pvpnTdE,And when the child is adult then friends as well ☺️
fyO8pvpnTdE,Undiagnosed bipolar mother 😅
fyO8pvpnTdE,Wow you explained it really well. I think I got some of the answers for me as well. I relate to you a lot there. I don&#39;t think I wanna have kids. I&#39;m really insecure abt my emotions and I hate how awkward I am in social situations (my stepdad is authoritarian + dismissive).
fyO8pvpnTdE,Our assuming that their is racism could be called racist ;)
fyO8pvpnTdE,join us!
fyO8pvpnTdE,I hope you can help me or support or something I realy cant wait when Ill live with dad if that haopens And I peomis to be different parrnt then her<br>P.S. supporting toxic families.
fyO8pvpnTdE,Read all
fyO8pvpnTdE,Elaborate please
fyO8pvpnTdE,wait until he draws the imaginary friend
fyO8pvpnTdE,Amen!😁😘😇🙏
fyO8pvpnTdE,Amen!
fyO8pvpnTdE,Lucky you
fyO8pvpnTdE,"Me too! He’s the perfect parent. Loving acceptance but firm guidance, and it’s so comforting to know He always has my best interests in mind."
fyO8pvpnTdE,Stereotypical but also statistically true unfortunately
fyO8pvpnTdE,@Prism Games you are right. I changed it to stereotypical
fyO8pvpnTdE,"I think you&#39;re looking too deep into this. When you try to find the ever present evil - &quot;racism&quot;, you&#39;ll find it."
fyO8pvpnTdE,Im 30 on the same boat
fyO8pvpnTdE,🤔
fyO8pvpnTdE,"To the 12 tribes of Jacob that are scattered throughout the four corners of the earth and the strangers that have joined themselves unto them........<br><br>.....Research God’s Time in Genesis 1:14.  God’s Sabbath is calculated by the sun, moon and stars, not by the Gregorian or any other man made calendar hanging on our walls.  <br><br>God may allow the “Powers To Be” to enforce some type of “Sabbath Law” before  He deliver His people from all nations, to see if we will keep His Law or no.

fyO8pvpnTdE,"@stitches Where I live the middle class is thriving. Tbh the troublesome kids all come from homes with parents that are too permissive. Then the parents argue with the school about ”why their kids are being singled out” and see no trouble in their ”little angels” behaviour. Throwing bowling balls, kicking their parents, kicking other kids when they’re down is apparently ok according to these parents. The bad kids are just being misunderstood…<br> But yes sure there are the kids from broken homes too. Those kids that most people feel for. When one of your kids bring one into your home they tend to be mostly agreeable. Not knowing all the social codes ofc. But you’ll see a tear in the eyes of those kids when you serve homemade cinnamon rolls with a glass of milk. Those kids are heartbroken and not the real problem in society. They do need some extra love and good role models."
fyO8pvpnTdE,"@John David I agree completely. I have been teaching for 17 years, high school for 14 of those, and you really summarized it well."
fyO8pvpnTdE,"Most Asian families have  small houses, no place for a time out When I came to Australia than heard about giving kids time out, so we did"
fyO8pvpnTdE,😂😂😂
fyO8pvpnTdE,Aye you’re not alone. Latinos feel that pain 🤌🏼
fyO8pvpnTdE,But an article on the UNZ website says Asians are second only to he brews for agreeing with spanking.
fyO8pvpnTdE,I miss that smack to the face time.
fyO8pvpnTdE,"Yeah, essentially. I only had one parent and she was very emotionally neglectful and abusive. Sometimes physical too."
fyO8pvpnTdE,@nattouro parent detected
fyO8pvpnTdE,"lmao, commenters are some of the least intelligent people i&#39;ve ever seen."
fyO8pvpnTdE,"That&#39;s the autoritarian. But they didn&#39;t include child abuse on the video, since it&#39;s not &quot;parenting&quot; by definition."
fyO8pvpnTdE,@Souven Tudu Why is it the worst? Can you elaborate your experiences?
fyO8pvpnTdE,"@Souven Tudu it&#39;s literally the best out of the 5, you&#39;re either pinning your parents incorrectly or you didn&#39;t watch the video"
fyO8pvpnTdE,Agree
fyO8pvpnTdE,Same here
fyO8pvpnTdE,"@Imane Pink ironically from somebody who doesnt 100% believe that the parenting style is good, i dont know any downsides to it unless your really begging me to poke holes in it"
fyO8pvpnTdE,"@markw999 If you don&#39;t want to argue, don&#39;t have kids. Have a dog."
fyO8pvpnTdE,"@VieraXXII I respond with grace and love because being a kid is tough with that being said the reality of eternity matters. It matters to Almighty God, your parents, and the body of Christ.<br> A person&#39;s worldview matters absolutely. You have to ultimately decide what your world view is... The question to ask yourself -<br>Do you believer God&#39;s word or man&#39;s worldview?  Have you taken the time to examine what your parents have been instilling in you or are you ignoring them and experiencing negative consequences?<br>If your parents are raising you with a biblical worldview are you going out of your way to complain about what God&#39;s word actually says? The Bible is very clear about life. It&#39;s very important to read, ask questions and fully understand your worldview so that when you are pass into the age of accountability you will be able to make righteous decisions.<br>These are just somethings to consider as you are growing into adulthood.<br>Once you&#39;re all grown up your parents can&#39;t redo your entire childhood. At some point you&#39;re going to need to take responsibility for what you believe. If you are under their roof you are under the age of accountability spiritually and as you mature and understand biblical authority and how it all come into place you will be accountable for everything you&#39;re setting out to do .<br>We all will be held accountable for everything we do in or to the bodies we&#39;ve been given.<br>May you be blessed in the knowledge and understanding of Christ."
fyO8pvpnTdE,"Just don’t show them too much of the world. Keep the magic alive. Also, don’t dumb down your vocabulary around them. Those are generally right ways to raise a child, but obviously there’s a ton more to it than just that."
fyO8pvpnTdE,Them asking questions is the goal. Doesn&#39;t hurt to help them find answers.
fyO8pvpnTdE,"No it doesnt. At least it does not always  work. Mostly it works for toddlers to take away the danger/forbidden Item/ etc. Of course you tell them &quot;this is dangerous, because .....&quot;. A toddler will take time until they repeat &quot;this is dangerous&quot; and even more until they understand why."
fyO8pvpnTdE,@L A there&#39;s this channel by a chick called Thais Gibson. I think it&#39;s called Personal Development School. She discuss attachment styles and core wounds. And then it takes you to her website where the quiz rests.
fyO8pvpnTdE,Where is this quiz?
fyO8pvpnTdE,Thats authoritarian parents But a little extreme.
fyO8pvpnTdE,Same. But every child needs its limits. But cleaning and gutters at the age of 10 😬
fyO8pvpnTdE,You got the two worst at of all
fyO8pvpnTdE,@North Star 🤣🤣🤣
fyO8pvpnTdE,Those who make games dont allow their children more than that. Why? They know the result
fyO8pvpnTdE,When will I set boundaries?
fyO8pvpnTdE,Basically they damage their child emotionally and never patch up their wounds
fyO8pvpnTdE,My parents were authoritarian so that their lives can be easier as a parent. They didnt think of the effects of their rules and yelling. I am struggling with this to this day.
fyO8pvpnTdE,@Don Luz very true!
fyO8pvpnTdE,a lot of parents say they want the best for their child but they really want the best child and its unhealthy
fyO8pvpnTdE,Lol try being a parent. I try harder at my job as a dad than anything else in my life and I feel like I’m constantly messing up. It’s easy to judge parents when you’re not one
fyO8pvpnTdE,"@Taytay Shaniqua. we always contradict because they were very much type of authoritarian. While that line always got me, I also think I shouldn&#39;t have to be like them for my future child. I don&#39;t disobey much, only if they accept my point which always not. The struggle is to stay low but can&#39;t hold any longer :))"
fyO8pvpnTdE,If your attitude is something that you consciously do then fine maybe
fyO8pvpnTdE,I don’t think that’s true
fyO8pvpnTdE,Good idea.<br>I&#39;m going to send it to my son. but he probably won&#39;t watch it simply because his mother sent it!
fyO8pvpnTdE,@Tom Kelly it’s disingenuous to assume that people want to be saved
fyO8pvpnTdE,"Your efforts do matter but real change takes time and effort. You can do it, I believe in you!<br>Also no one is going to save you so you better do it, or else!<br><br>I&#39;m going for the authoritative approach there"
fyO8pvpnTdE,i see your having trouble finding purpose
fyO8pvpnTdE,"I feel you. It rarely feel natural to be a responsible adult who always do his chore in advance to have free time afterward. Sometime I&#39;m feeling getting the hang of it and then one bad day where I decide to push everything tomorrow and BOOM, the kitchen sink is filled and I clean my clothes when I have no more clean underwear XD !"
fyO8pvpnTdE,I think mine is a mix of the crazy strict one and neglectful one.
fyO8pvpnTdE,"She told me that, by frowning, I was being an embarrassment to her or something around those lines after she chewed me out."
fyO8pvpnTdE,Because the parent doesn&#39;t have a thing to bash you yet. So u wait on the corner. 🤣
fyO8pvpnTdE,Same!
fyO8pvpnTdE,You can never be sure so ALWAYS be careful
fyO8pvpnTdE,@Low ChinAnn my sister has so i know it doesnt go well..
fyO8pvpnTdE,"Pls don&#39;t try your luck against parent authorities in that case, it ends badly for me. sighs"
fyO8pvpnTdE,@MysticalMagic92 well said 👌
fyO8pvpnTdE,"Authoritative parenting is often considered the best style. Notice how the results are almost completely positive? However, each parenting style has upsides and downsides. No style is perfect. The end of the video does give tips on how to parent though. All that matters is making sure you parent in a way that teaches your children responsibility while making sure they follow directions. However, you should also make sure they are capable of independent thought and give them enough freedom. Most importantly, do not forget to take their happiness into account, which is the part where most parents fail, leaving unhappy children who grow up damaged. There is no &quot;best&quot; style. Just parent as best you can. No one is perfect, but don&#39;t forget to consider your child&#39;s feelings as best you can."
fyO8pvpnTdE,"I&#39;m just so angry at myself because I don&#39;t have enough self confidence to do things that I truly want. I really fcking hate my life, even the degree that I have is not chosen by me."
fyO8pvpnTdE,"This has greatly affected me since I&#39;m the eldest. I remembered during childhood, when I tend to cry I have to suppress it and even reasoning out leads to talking back. There&#39;s too much pressure coming from them, so to avoid disappointment I do things that would make them happy but not for me. Even in decision making, I would often thought what would my parents think if I do this or that would they get mad? <br><br>Anyways I have four younger brothers and as time passes by they changed to Permissive parents. I had observed that the youngest can do things freely and can say things with any restrictions. <br><br>I just felt like it was a bit unfair, during my early primary school days I was forced to study everyday. Even when it comes to learning in writing and reading my mother is the one who teaches me. Eventually I cry because she&#39;s so aggressive(like spanking my hand while writing) and then told me to stop immediately or else I&#39;ll be beaten (bunalan). Throughout my primary school days I was often compared to my honored cousin and it really feels like sht. They even mocked my grades although is not that bad and I didn&#39;t even received a line of seven. When, two of my younger brothers had very low scores on their GPA they didn&#39;t even make a fuss.<br><br>If I would be a parent someday, I would not be like them."
fyO8pvpnTdE,&quot;Might leave her unhappy on the inside&quot;
fyO8pvpnTdE,Obviously! This is just a general outline of the biggest &amp; most &#39;extreme&#39; groups. No one is stating that every single set of parents in the world fits perfectly into one of these categories. Real life is obviously more nuanced than this. But this certainly helps us set a guideline parameter when trying to understand a situation better.
fyO8pvpnTdE,@Astrid oh! Sorry that went over my head!
fyO8pvpnTdE,@aaron reyes I was trying to make a joke about Scandinavian parenting being left out lol.
fyO8pvpnTdE,@Astrid you’ll have to preface that cause I can’t automatically know what you’re talking about so you have to clarify
fyO8pvpnTdE,@aaron reyes Where does Scandi fall in ? LMAO
fyO8pvpnTdE,@DJ King 5000 yes.
fyO8pvpnTdE,So that means authoritative is the best one
fyO8pvpnTdE,@N S But this should not spoil the image or overshadow normal and good parents. Most of them are sane. Few of them are insane. So parents should not be categorised into one bad category
fyO8pvpnTdE,@N SI know what you are talking about. Pretty much most of the  parents in india. This comes down to the way they were raised.20th century ideology. But most of them are not bad people. That&#39;s for sure. Abuse means physically or mentally harming them to the condition that the children want to kill themselves or loose interest in life. But that&#39;s not in most of the cases. Very few are that extreme. But more than half of them have some degree of it for sure. Not mine but I can understand as I&#39;m from Asia.
fyO8pvpnTdE,"@kushwanth sai You&#39;re still not getting it. Right path for what? Doing everything according to whatever your parents have planned for your future? NO it isn&#39;t the right path. Some parents really want obedient children WHICH IS WRONG why don&#39;t you get it? Parents who try to control everything in their children&#39;s life, are wrong at the first place, their intentions goals are wrong. Children shouldn&#39;t be puppets. But some parents want it to be that way. Parents should be in right path at first, like giving space to their children to at least have their own plans and own personality. You clearly don&#39;t experienced abuse for sure. It can be psychical and mental. Some people genuinely don&#39;t want the good or &quot;right path&quot; they want to raise someone who does follow everything they order."
fyO8pvpnTdE,@N S that is what I telling<br>They want their child in right path. But they use methods which are not right
fyO8pvpnTdE,"​@kushwanth sai Nah it&#39;s abusive. There are thousand of parents (especially Asians) who put their anger out of children. Beating up a child who&#39;s unable to understand complicated situations only would make their confidence scarred and it even causes children to build up deep rooted mental illnesses. Physical abuse never does any good to anyone in any age. No intention can justify &quot;beating up&quot;, I&#39;m not talking about spanking or little slaps for wicked kids. Idk if you&#39;ve ever experienced abuse as a child, but even well educated parents don&#39;t understand this concept of abuse because they were taught this is the right way, which is certainly WRONG. Most of the times abusive parents&#39; &quot;intentions&quot; are literally to threaten children and make them obedient slaves and idk if you think this is right but children are not properties, parents should be guiding them not controlling them."
fyO8pvpnTdE,maybe overinvolved?
fyO8pvpnTdE,Yes
fyO8pvpnTdE,"No, this is untrue af.<br>Gryffindor doesn&#39;t mean obviusly good, Hufflepuff doesn&#39;t mean meh, Ravenclaw doesn&#39;t mean meh and Slytherin doesn&#39;t mean bad bruh"
fyO8pvpnTdE,"Emotions bad, money good"
fyO8pvpnTdE,Stolen comment lol
fyO8pvpnTdE,Same :)
fyO8pvpnTdE,=control
fyO8pvpnTdE,"jack of all trade huh? you should be master of none,LMAO"
fyO8pvpnTdE,"That&#39;s why I believe the fundamentals is praying and asking God to guide your parenting. It&#39;s really not easy. Call it, the God parenting style 😂😂😂."
fyO8pvpnTdE,"@Souven Tudu no worries, all is good."
fyO8pvpnTdE,"@Souven Tudu Also, my best regards on your parents being low quality people. I hope you&#39;re doing better today."
fyO8pvpnTdE,"@Souven Tudu Okay, firstly I&#39;m not going to invalidate you and I can agree to a point, though this is completely subjective? Though I said I had all of them (except Authoritative). Wouldn&#39;t that be worse though since not only you&#39;ll be physically and mentally abused but also messed up with conflicted emotions and what your parents are. Because I can also say that is also the worst.<br><br>The feeling that they care for you but they actually don&#39;t and when you&#39;re threatened by them and they don&#39;t seem to care and also care and just let it happen? They amounts of distrust one can gain from that? <br><br>But if I misunderstood you and you&#39;re trying to say the those two are the worst/one of the worst then that I can agree. Or you&#39;re trying to say that those two styles as individuals are the worst O would also agree to a point. <br><br>Like I said completely subjective, I see helicopter parent and authoritarian as the worst and worst combo."
fyO8pvpnTdE,"@Souven Tudu ooh okay thanks for clarifying, I got confused. Sorry to hear you had a tough experience."
fyO8pvpnTdE,@Souven Tudu Uhm okay but I&#39;m not sure how that relates to my comment?
fyO8pvpnTdE,I feel like some parents only have kids so the parents can parentify kids later to them
fyO8pvpnTdE,However not everyone “decides” to have a kid lol. Accidents happen!
fyO8pvpnTdE,"I couldn&#39;t agree more with this comment, I am growing with parents who have their own trauma and take no responsibility in addressing it, they have a terrible marriage and I am the product of that. Couples who have issues with their marriage should not even think of having a child, they need to figure out their problems first."
fyO8pvpnTdE,Yes .. they need to heal before having em too
fyO8pvpnTdE,Thank god my stepdad got in my life early. I could already see the effects my bio dad from not being there for me. Holy shit did he straightened me up 😂
fyO8pvpnTdE,"yeah, dad&#39;s really make or break the family. cause they can even usually stop a mom from helicoptering too."
fyO8pvpnTdE,😭🖐️
fyO8pvpnTdE,Exactly
fyO8pvpnTdE,True
fyO8pvpnTdE,Sim kkkkkk
fyO8pvpnTdE,Same
fyO8pvpnTdE,Question is: Do you wanna feel attacked?
fyO8pvpnTdE,Extremely
fyO8pvpnTdE,"Yeah I just assumed this was normal. I always knew that something was wrong, but didn’t want to get in trouble for trying to confront my parents (specifically my father - my mom is ❤️🔒) as I didn’t want to get in trouble. I want to have more freedom, but I am a teen and know self-control. I feel like my voice is heard by my mom but she is overwhelmed, and ignored by my dad because he keeps taking on projects and being too busy to discuss stuff. Idk, I just feel like they have a bad habit of micromanaging everything I do, making me feel trapped. I try to communicate, but whenever I do something without express permission I get in trouble. I’m supposed to ask my father (my mom doesn’t care as much about it) before going on ANY NEW WEBSITE, and I’m not supposed to communicate with strangers on the internet at all (…). I’m IN MY TEENS! I’M NOT SIX!!"
fyO8pvpnTdE,"For me, it’s true. Harsh, but the truth."
fyO8pvpnTdE,"Best of luck to you, then! ☺️ I hope you are doing well today!"
fyO8pvpnTdE,"@B M Well, when you love somebody you are prepared to go to hell and back for them,right? I do not just say that.I do that. I do dangerous jobs that no one wants to do because it pays well and I can do as many hours per week as I want. My son and daughter will be proud of their &quot;old man&quot; some day."
fyO8pvpnTdE,you can only do your best. we are people not superhumans.
fyO8pvpnTdE,Thanks for sharing this 🙏
fyO8pvpnTdE,😢 i’m sorry to hear that
fyO8pvpnTdE,good for you
fyO8pvpnTdE,It depends on how far it&#39;s taken
fyO8pvpnTdE,@S Wisdom oh mb I wasn&#39;t wearing my glasses
fyO8pvpnTdE,"@ZeppKF no, reread my post. I&#39;m saying she didn&#39;t let us go to friends house and vice versa"
fyO8pvpnTdE,"She&#39;s right though, learning social skills is critical in being successful/a functioning adult."
fyO8pvpnTdE,but it feels kinda fabricated
fyO8pvpnTdE,felt
fyO8pvpnTdE,"Back in the days as well.. me and my dad was living with my aunt and uncle.. they always told my dad not to beat me a lot. Until one day.. they decided to kick my dad out because he was getting too violent.. they asked me, if I wanted to stay with them or my dad. They told me they don&#39;t want to see me getting beaten anymore.. but.. I still picked my dad, not out of fear.. but because I knew he&#39;d be alone if I joined my aunt and uncle instead. I remember seeing my dad tear up when he knew that I chose him.. he still beat me with a belt after we moved.. but.. with more love."
fyO8pvpnTdE,"However, I also remember how my parents used to give their food to me and they&#39;d just eat left overs.. they&#39;d given me shelter.. they gave me the things I needed for my school projects.. I remember my dad accidentally cutting his hand because he was trying to sharpen my pencil because we didn&#39;t have a sharpener. ( we were pretty poor ).  What I learned from all of these as I grew up.. is that parents are not perfect.. and you should know from their mistakes what you need to do when you grow up."
fyO8pvpnTdE,Thanks for sharing this 🙏 maybe you can do some traveling sometime this epidemic is over. Get away for a while
fyO8pvpnTdE,Email us - maybe we can work together ;)
fyO8pvpnTdE,So much love from everyone! Thank you :D
fyO8pvpnTdE,My parents are the same!  Permissive and authoritative are the best mix when it comes to parenting.
fyO8pvpnTdE,Most recently...should I try to bring up anything from years ago...instead of allowing me to have a voice he allows my ex to walk all over me...whereas when we were together...I don&#39;t believe her mother taught her about boundaries.
fyO8pvpnTdE,"He is somewhat neglectful; prime example, apparently in middle school my mothers jewelry had gone missing. I&#39;ve been truthful the entire time but no matter what he does not actually listen he just consistently blames. Which is why I&#39;m fairly attached to my mother...least she actually listens and does not consistently over many years blame the wrong people."
fyO8pvpnTdE,Authoritarian seems to have money as having money is a norm.
fyO8pvpnTdE,the helicopter parents definitely have money
fyO8pvpnTdE,There&#39;s no research on that
fyO8pvpnTdE,"or maybe just a bunch of raisins, who knows?"
fyO8pvpnTdE,"luckily I am fat and the fat does protect me somehow against those heavy-duty beating mine parent apply on me, no wound or mark left. Stay strong"
fyO8pvpnTdE,"I sort of relate to this, my mom used to be a bit abusive and my life was a living hell, but after I turned 9, she earned more money and started spoiling me (I never thought the world revolved around me though). Now I feel kinda guilty."
fyO8pvpnTdE,Thanks for sharing 🙏
fyO8pvpnTdE,same goes here
fyO8pvpnTdE,My mom was very strict with my brother when he was growing up and she was a bit more lenient with me as well as letting me get away with a bunch of bs. I can see the difference in our personalities.
fyO8pvpnTdE,You see through because you had to adopt that ability in order to &quot;survive&quot;
fyO8pvpnTdE,Look up INFJ
fyO8pvpnTdE,If you had psychic powers the prom would have been hella lit for you..
fyO8pvpnTdE,probably #5
fyO8pvpnTdE,Agree
fyO8pvpnTdE,Oh damn I could sing a song ablut that one.<br>My Parents have always been like day and Night.<br>Both tried to raise me in completely different ways which only confused me about whatvis right and what is wrong.
fyO8pvpnTdE,I think this is my case. Permissive mother and a bit neglectful father
fyO8pvpnTdE,@Anunimates _2 true
fyO8pvpnTdE,And then the less liked parent guilt trips you about it constantly
fyO8pvpnTdE,"@Lucas Oliveira De Jesus Jesus Get over it? What kind of advice is that?! Yes, we can&#39;t just give up in the face of challenges, but we can&#39;t just &quot;get over it&quot;. We have to learn to deal with those challenges in healthy ways."
fyO8pvpnTdE,"Yeah, neglectful parenting is the reason why those ATTENTION SEEKING DRAMA QUEENS EXIST<br><b>hyperventilates</b><br>I need to calm down"
fyO8pvpnTdE,"Gabrielle Tollerson..the man said &quot;get over&quot; it and u react like that , that&quot;get over it &quot; is the only true advice i&#39;ve seen so far ...most of the others are just relating and sympathizing.I knwow from experience its not easy ....but the choice is yours  feel sorry for yourself ...or work hard on yourself and &quot;get over it&quot;"
fyO8pvpnTdE,"@Lucas Oliveira De Jesus Jesus oh wow, that helps us a lot…."
fyO8pvpnTdE,@Eleni Tgk but the fact that you recognize that is good. You know the issue and can work on it. Perhaps with a therapist. You can start over with the new skills and make new friends and better decisions. Good luck to you.
fyO8pvpnTdE,THATS MY PARENTS
fyO8pvpnTdE,Didn&#39;t even thought about that ...Great comment
fyO8pvpnTdE,demon artificers...
fyO8pvpnTdE,I felt thatt....my parents are between all 5 styles and it seems so confusing to understand or predict their responses/ reactions. They used to be the over involved-freedom style but then they realized it didn&#39;t work and for a couple of years now they are the strict-not involved ones......it really messed me up😅😓
fyO8pvpnTdE,It&#39;s possible ?
fyO8pvpnTdE,"And for god&#39;s sake, a 20+ grand a year Uni is NOT for &quot;finding yourself.&quot;"
fyO8pvpnTdE,The caring but sort of strict one seems the best
fyO8pvpnTdE,I have a twin brother and my social skills are so bad 😂
fyO8pvpnTdE,"With all due respect, I will consider &quot;finding myself&quot; after I can sustain myself. Life is expensive and unforgiving in that regard, regardless of what childhood you had."
fyO8pvpnTdE,"Yes, agree. But the difference is that how much you were broken."
fyO8pvpnTdE,@Souven Tudu Isn&#39;t authoritarian and neglectful contradictory?
fyO8pvpnTdE,@Souven Tudu Why?
fyO8pvpnTdE,@Souven Tudu Why?
fyO8pvpnTdE,I agree with the video&#39;s portrayal.  Far-East Asian parents are more authoritarian.  The stereotype is accurate.<br><br>-son of Far-East Asian parents
fyO8pvpnTdE,Which type of parent are you going to be?
fyO8pvpnTdE,"@Ashley Woolf Yeah, they’d give me a lot of toys, probably so I’d have something to do without having to involve them."
fyO8pvpnTdE,"It just sounds like dismissive to me. (neglectful).. I was treated this way too.  I was forced into hobbies that had no relevance to my own interests, and then they wouldn&#39;t bother to show up to the competitions- just send me off on a bus. It&#39;s odd.  I was pretty much given everything I asked for (sometimes a lot MORE than I asked for) but everything except time and attention and to be treated like a human whose opinion mattered."
fyO8pvpnTdE,Don’t think of that literally
fyO8pvpnTdE,I would do my best if anyone actually wanted to have a family with me
fyO8pvpnTdE,My moral codes be like:
fyO8pvpnTdE,Or no family at all
fyO8pvpnTdE,Wow❤️
fyO8pvpnTdE,"And Asia, except I&#39;m somehow that lucky kid who has parents that don&#39;t care what I do"
fyO8pvpnTdE,"My parents keep doing it and whenever they do it idk why but I feel just hurt and I&#39;d think about it almost all day.<br><br>But then again, my parents don&#39;t care whatever I do and only asks me to study and be obedient to them so maybe that&#39;s why I&#39;m worse idk"
fyO8pvpnTdE,same sentiments they would always compare you to other success while you are struggling to build your own success and demeaning words would make you hate them even more.
fyO8pvpnTdE,How come? explain
fyO8pvpnTdE,You’re blessed
fyO8pvpnTdE,True
fyO8pvpnTdE,Same.
fyO8pvpnTdE,"Jordan Peterson bro, look it up!"
fyO8pvpnTdE,"You should find yourself a role-model you can follow. Find a man you look up to like a co-worker, your boss, your friends father. Look around and try to imitate them. If you feel that you&#39;re doing something wrong try to imagine what that person would be doing at this moment. Dont shame yourself too much, because thats unhealthy and you have to be yourself in the end, but definietly try to remove all your bad aspects. Try to be the best version of yourself one step at a time, every single day.. Consistency is hard and tiresome, but its the key to success in life."
fyO8pvpnTdE,@Glutenfree yeah but don&#39;t over do it and make the spoiled... you don&#39;t want that too
fyO8pvpnTdE,nah i think of it as a cycle in a cycle<br><br>people who get out of the cycle can get INTO the cycle again and it looks like it is far easier to get in than to get out
fyO8pvpnTdE,@Hot Chocolate go awf 😩✋
fyO8pvpnTdE,The parents might be true love while you as a child could be just the byproduct or accident by them.
fyO8pvpnTdE,"Pursuing difficult and meaningful tasks will make you stronger, so they will stop being difficult after a while. Kids are very very rewarding. You get to have someone new in your life that loves you."
fyO8pvpnTdE,"@Aimee Kelly Not all, but it&#39;s justified and normalized in Asian society"
fyO8pvpnTdE,@Melo Kebeni  I dont know  I&#39;m not a functional grown up so
fyO8pvpnTdE,"But even once you develop that pain resistance and you&#39;re no longer crying when they hit you, they get mad because you&#39;re not crying.<br><br>What did they want from us?"
fyO8pvpnTdE,Yeah my father still tells me that you have to cry only when someone dies otherwise you have no reason to; while if my mother saw me cry she wanted to hit me to make me stop. When I was a child it was so difficult to avoid every feelings 🙃
fyO8pvpnTdE,That’s called abusive parents. That’s not a parenting style that’s a means for jail 🙏
fyO8pvpnTdE,It&#39;s true. LOLLLLL
fyO8pvpnTdE,Not if the stereotypes are true and apart of their culture...
fyO8pvpnTdE,"Well, they showed a black family for the most ideal. And a white family for the hippies. People have physical traits, you know. Pretty close to NOTHING is discriminatory. Pop your buble."
fyO8pvpnTdE,Yeah but on average it&#39;s true
fyO8pvpnTdE,I agree with this.  Especially since babysitters of young kids are fulfilling the role of parenting for the parent during the day.
fyO8pvpnTdE,"@Jasmine I&#39;d agree. In the US, it&#39;s pretty hard to have a middle class lifestyle without dual incomes. Pretty sure my parents wanted to have me, and worked because they wanted to provide for me. I understood this from a young age, and therefore, didn&#39;t feel neglected. Sure, they could have been there more, but they didn&#39;t neglect me."
fyO8pvpnTdE,I would rather be with my nanny than with my parents<br>I was so in peace with her but never mind...
fyO8pvpnTdE,"Idk, both of my parents have careers and they weren&#39;t &quot;neglectful&quot;"
fyO8pvpnTdE,I never thought of it that way
fyO8pvpnTdE,"@study tips rewiring the brain, increase brain plasticity e.g. meditation, do check some researches"
fyO8pvpnTdE,@maybemaybenot howww?
fyO8pvpnTdE,"Same thing.i thought i m alone who faces this type of parents.,but here in the comments i see i alot of people suppresed due to their parents.May God give us patience abd confidence"
fyO8pvpnTdE,That perfectly describes me.
fyO8pvpnTdE,@Gibby how can we solve this problem?
fyO8pvpnTdE,They are
fyO8pvpnTdE,"I had almost an identical upbringing but my mother escaped a cult so our religion was anti-religion. (They always showed disappointment when I hung out with my best friend who went to a Christian church). <br><br>But guess what! I turned out pretty normal. Just like everyone there’s thing we think back on and say “hey! That wasn’t right!” And there’s other things that we look back on and say “oh, that makes sense now.” Keep your head up sweet lady!"
fyO8pvpnTdE,"wow how did you perfectly describe my life: When i was a kid my mom was permissive and got us everything we wanted. Then as a teenager wanted us to magically become responsible and get everything perfectly done. No room for mistakes for me personally. Then when i messed up i was condemned, called lazy, disrespectful and ungrateful. These past few weeks i been in a hole of from being utterly depressed and confused. To trying to build myself up again despite the constant triggers in my daily life. Finally realizing my mom is a covert narcissist. I’m only 15 and I truly want a therapist as well who wouldn’t mess up my custody situation once they hear the problems and toxic situations with my mom. Then hand me to my malignant narcissist and sociopathic father. I figure I need help, possibly get diagnosed and medicated for the mental health problems that I have been facing in a cycle for the past 4 yrs. But i’m currently at a stuck position to what direction to point myself to and how to face and deal with the realization that finally came to mind. My mom completely psychologically and emotionally abuses me and my siblings. But i don’t know what to do and who to turn to. Everyday i constantly think about everything, and how to be happy. I been feeling trapped for a while trying to create a door to open when i have no tools or knowledge to construct it with. I hope we all try to create a safe haven and a solution to our problems and guide ourselves to make a better home we had never lived in."
fyO8pvpnTdE,Same...
fyO8pvpnTdE,"I&#39;m sorry you have such bad parents. I hope you have better days coming up &amp; that you have things to live for, like another chapter of a book. It doesn&#39;t have to be much, just as long as it keeps you going &amp; from doing anything extreme. I was suicidal too, but I keep going in order to finish reading a book. I know, sounds pretty silly but it kept me going. I would say to myself, just one more page, just one more page. Now I have more to live for, but I hope my suggestion may help you. But, please, as a random stranger on the internet, please don&#39;t end your life. Please, I&#39;m begging you. Don&#39;t do it."
fyO8pvpnTdE,The comment i waited to see. I&#39;m like I can&#39;t be the only person who is greatful for what they had lol
fyO8pvpnTdE,Same more or less. Father not neglectful but paid much attention to his career. I love them sm!!
fyO8pvpnTdE,Permissive
fyO8pvpnTdE,@Alex Sch My parents are rather religious and affirmative so I disagree.
fyO8pvpnTdE,<b>religious</b> parenting
fyO8pvpnTdE,@Lonely Survivor oh okay - that must be the reason why fundamentalists of every bs imaginable are thriving in the US
fyO8pvpnTdE,good for you
fyO8pvpnTdE,I am so sorry to hear this.
fyO8pvpnTdE,Bingo. Stay strong.
fyO8pvpnTdE,Me as well
fyO8pvpnTdE,Me too :(

fyO8pvpnTdE,@Dorito legend ✌️🙂👍
fyO8pvpnTdE,Well I&#39;m happy I got parents who don&#39;t even care what I&#39;m doing<br>Edit: looking back at this comment I just lied a bit bruh
fyO8pvpnTdE,@Taytay Shaniqua. tive
fyO8pvpnTdE,What’s the difference between authoritarian and authoritative?
fyO8pvpnTdE,@Andrea Velásquez I know what you mean! They have their flaws but I cannot imagine them any other way :)
fyO8pvpnTdE,"Wow, your description fits my parents really well! I wouldn&#39;t change them for anything"
fyO8pvpnTdE,What did you say? What was the original comment?
fyO8pvpnTdE,"@krakilla krak da, tot ce descrii este corect si chiar iti multumesc mult pentru asa un mesaj bine scris si sincer. E foarte trist ce citesc despre prietenii tai. Nu vreau sa cred ca asa ceva exista asa de raspandit. Romania este intr-o directie mai buna, sper ca generatille viitoare sa fie crescute cu mai putine traume. <br><br>Da, poate imi doresc sa vada si altii adevarul, dar acum mai putin decat inainte. Mai mult din cauza ca o parte din durere e si altii s-au simtit increzatori sa imi dea &quot;sfaturi&quot; si vorbe care nu mai ajutau.. pentru ca ei nu stiau de fapt cum stau lucrurile. Si eu taceam, ziceam &quot;da, fiecare cu ale lui&quot; si tineam asa un zid intre mine si restul. <br><br>Bine observat, tata a avut un tata si mai nebun. Cu totii stim. Bunica spune multe si nimeni nu o crede! E o femeie cu minte puternica, spune totul asa cum e. Eu o cred, e singura explicatie. Another thing, e ciudat cum toti din familie se fac nu aud, nici macar nu ii zic femeii &quot;imi pare rau sa aud ca ai trecut prin atat greu&quot;. E clar ca problema e generationala. <br><br>Cand m-am simtit intr-un loc bun (emotional si personal) atunci dintr-o data, tot ce tineam in mine a iesit la suprafata. A fost ineviabil, un after-shock greu de controlat. Parca abia acum se descarca un pic sufletul. Ca atunci cand fugi de ceva sau cineva, nu te gandesti la sentimente. Abia atunci cand ai scapat, te opresti, stai si incepi sa plangi dintr-o data. Te bucuri, dar plangi. Nu este &quot;self pity&quot;. E un fel de &quot;Doamne, prin ce am trecut cu o inima sincera... la cate ocazii puteam sa fiu fucked-up pe viata.... sa fiu trapped in the dark....&quot; <br><br>Am si eu un sfat pt tine. Iti recomand sa cauti prieteni din familii bune, crescuti de oameni cumsecade. E ca si cum intri in alt univers, e tare frumos."
fyO8pvpnTdE,"Ah and I live in Germany, where the masses after WW2 learned, that looking away when psychopaths have their pleasure is a viable survival strategy. Further Greece being bankrupt must be punished severely, the pleasure of the German sadists who vote. Last we had a &quot;nice&quot; defense Minister &quot;Ursula von der Leyen&quot;, who shamelessly instrumentalized her children to bypass criticism from the hacker community, with respect to her children protection plans. As a German hacker who, while she was our Defense minister worked for the German military, I still find it interesting, that von der Leyen could not wait to leave her position as defense minister exactly when I filed a criminal charge, with respect to possible enemy spy operations and the endangerment of Germany. Now we apparently have children protection mechanisms, that would make the Stasi and Gestapo blush - no one in Germany would abuse such mechanisms as your history clearly demonstrates. <br>There of course no investigation into the potential high treason behind my above criminal charge, the did not even hear me as witness. I am curious if Germany survives the next decades, it does not deserve it, to be clear."
fyO8pvpnTdE,"Literally , crying is a natural process , i think sometimes we need to stop but suppression is just a horrible experience ."
fyO8pvpnTdE,"They aren&#39;t parents, they are abusers. In fact, 4 out of the 5 mentioned &quot;parenting styles&quot; aren&#39;t parenting, but abusive behaviors."
fyO8pvpnTdE,they are not considered as parents
fyO8pvpnTdE,Damn seems like your parents are headed for jail.
fyO8pvpnTdE,Those parents should be behind bars before taking part in any research about parenting
fyO8pvpnTdE,Reply :)
fyO8pvpnTdE,Lol I&#39;m dumb. I got confused between authoritarian and authoritative.
fyO8pvpnTdE,I thought I was the only one like this ..
fyO8pvpnTdE,Same
fyO8pvpnTdE,I can thank my parents forever but that won&#39;t heal my social anxiety and deep troubles even while I am doing interesting things so no thanks
fyO8pvpnTdE,"Same, but I believe we don&#39;t have to feel guilty<br><br>Just because you were privliged or whatever doesn&#39;t mean you didn&#39;t struggle in many aspects in life,<br><br>My parents were the style that gave excessive freedom but valued my opinion and privacy, this gave me the privlige to never find my parents an obstacle to my life. <br><br>However, they never gave me active mentoring about life, which resulted in me struggling with some basic skills and things in life like making decisions or keeping up with deadlines or self discipline or being vertain about what I think <br><br>Also, your environment outside of your parents could be involved in your troubles, <br><br>my peers throughout school years excluded me (not in a mean way, and sometimes vocally mean without meaning to hurt but it still hurt even if I pretended it was not)<br><br>I was a quiet kid and this was heavily encouraged by my teachers, since this was the only thing I felt that made me stand out from my peers I continued to be the quiet kid even if I would have loved to be socializing with others. <br><br>What made things worse was the gap between my interests and the interests of my peers: At a young age, they watched boring adult drama shows while I loved watching cartoons and writing stories, this made speaking about my interests difficult with kids my age and I was more excluded than ever. Even when I had the courage to speak, their reactions were like &quot;... Ok?&quot; and I regret speaking afterwards.<br><br>I can go on forever but did you get the picture?<br><br>Sometimes our parents did the best of what they knew but it didn&#39;t fill everything we need"
fyO8pvpnTdE,"Words of wisdom , respect , i have even taken a screenshot for future reference."
fyO8pvpnTdE,Very insightful 👏
fyO8pvpnTdE,"will it is a graph right, and the further end was the extreme cases while mostly are some mixed and match between those."
fyO8pvpnTdE,@Avanti Giridharan haha will do
fyO8pvpnTdE,@Tito Santana please tell sprouts this
fyO8pvpnTdE,"@Avanti Giridharan Great, Looking forward to it."
fyO8pvpnTdE,Thanks for the idea. I&#39;ll see if I can write on that
fyO8pvpnTdE,@Avanti Giridharan I could not agree more.
fyO8pvpnTdE,"Hi, thanks for your input. So while researching, I found out that I&#39;m this one isn&#39;t an actual parenting style. Furthermore, since I&#39;m not an expert on parental abuse and it would have been too heavy a topic to tackle all at once,I thought it best to save it for another time."
fyO8pvpnTdE,Thank you so much 😍
fyO8pvpnTdE,@Corrin B what’s taking over your destiny?
fyO8pvpnTdE,Definitely too old ...  I started taking over my destiny at 15...

fyO8pvpnTdE,Haha
fyO8pvpnTdE,i feel kind of like this
fyO8pvpnTdE,"@Nur Amalia Athifah Azmi glad you&#39;re finding help. Life is difficult , but we live in an age where help is available.  Also, I&#39;m glad I asked Jesus/Yeshua to help me. His love and acceptance give hope and comfort xx"
fyO8pvpnTdE,@Michele Pascoe Thank you &lt;3
fyO8pvpnTdE,"@BoxingFan I actually am fixing my mental health fyi. I&#39;ve gone and seek psychiatric help, almost the same case as yours. Maybe you can try be a little less blunt with your comment, especially since we dont know anything about one another."
fyO8pvpnTdE,"@Mariana Mackinney Thank you for such a kind comment. I&#39;ve decided to go and seek for psychiatric help, which has helped me a lot. Much love"
fyO8pvpnTdE,Agreed. People should talk about a LOT of things before they get married. It&#39;s honestly not all about feelings and nice dates or vibes and chill.
fyO8pvpnTdE,@LK Music No?
fyO8pvpnTdE,"@Izabella YT TV ...nor the phrase &quot;He&#39;s married his mother, there&quot;? Never heard that one either?"
fyO8pvpnTdE,"@LK Music I never heard of one parent becoming one of the kids and the other parent governing over all of them, that sounds like a weird BDSM scenario"
fyO8pvpnTdE,Thank you so much! I&#39;m honored you liked my script and idea
fyO8pvpnTdE,That&#39;s so sad
fyO8pvpnTdE,Of course. Keep going
fyO8pvpnTdE,"@Hakim Diwan that’s awful. I’m sorry. I’m sure things will work out eventually, I guess sometimes you’ve just got to have hope."
fyO8pvpnTdE,@Michael Terrell  I did and that&#39;s when they told me to leave house :(
fyO8pvpnTdE,"@Hakim Diwan I am sorry to here this. But I do think that regardless of anything, the best way to face this is to face it head on. If they won’t listen to you, you’ve got to find some way of making them do so."
fyO8pvpnTdE,@Michael Terrell  Yes they love but they are Indians and have God complex saying anything against of their desire is considered to be disrespectful here so they are not ready to listen. If I tell them anything their standard reply will be &quot;If you have any problem just leave the house&quot; <br>Both of my parents are not fit to raise a child and as a matter of fact they were not fit to marry. I had never saw any couple who are more incompatible than my parents.
fyO8pvpnTdE,@Kooby spanking
fyO8pvpnTdE,what does the hand emoji mean?
fyO8pvpnTdE,Thank you 🤩
fyO8pvpnTdE,I love your perspective!
fyO8pvpnTdE,"​ @Junk IsTrash  first, I never said neglect AND abuse is a valid parenting style. I specifically said abuse is never a good option. <br><br>2nd, if you didn&#39;t notice, the parenting styles were categorized in a quadrant graph which means the degrees of parenting in that style can go from a little to extreme. You are jumping to the extreme end of the Cold + Complete Freedom when there are many lesser degrees of cold + freedom. <br><br>Every single one of those parenting styles turn sour when you jump to the extreme version of them... why aren&#39;t you complaining about the extreme of the other styles and automatically equating them with abuse like you did cold + freedom? <br><br>Are you projecting your upbringing? Did you have parents that were extreme cold + freedom?"
fyO8pvpnTdE,"So the neglectful and abusive parenting style is something you think should be considered just &quot;normal&quot;? If so, thent hat&#39;s just messed up thinking in my opinion."
fyO8pvpnTdE,"Oh please dude world has no place for an indecisive, confused, or a person who doesn&#39;t have boundaries. Yes one can fix themselves but that is extremely difficult to repair the damage and it&#39;s a slow agonising process. Don&#39;t water down it."
fyO8pvpnTdE,mine are a mix of the first four as well.
fyO8pvpnTdE,It changes according to age and temperament. At least it should.
fyO8pvpnTdE,@Hakim Diwan I think alcoholism has something to do with how my dad at least can change his mood and “parenting style” at a drop of a hat but I will admit I’m no physiologist so I might not be too good labeling these experiences
fyO8pvpnTdE,@Lisa Seabrook  One can&#39;t have two opposite parenting styles at same time. Unless they have Multiple Personality Disorder. Even if they changed overtime still they were practicing one style at one time.
fyO8pvpnTdE,@Hakim Diwan I have 2 parents that are very different from eachother and they have both changed over time
fyO8pvpnTdE,@Kooby Thank you
fyO8pvpnTdE,@Avanti Giridharan your art is so good :D
fyO8pvpnTdE,"Hi, thanks for your input. But since this video was on parenting styles, I focused only on the parenting styles. While siblings do have an impact, it&#39;s a whole new video"
fyO8pvpnTdE,no thanks
fyO8pvpnTdE,Good idea !
fyO8pvpnTdE,"@Muhammad Ibrahim The definition of abuse has changed thoroughly in my lifetime. What used to be normal is now considered horrific. A set of parents can be authoritative, style #3 , and later be accused of abuse. Parents as in #4 neglectful, are now considered good parents."
fyO8pvpnTdE,"Yep, you all are right. That&#39;s not parenting, and my dad should never have married my mom if he didn&#39;t want any of us (he&#39;s my stepdad). I&#39;m left with no desire to find a partner and a lesser desire to have any kids."
fyO8pvpnTdE,"Its the extreme end of authoritarian parents, didn’t?"
fyO8pvpnTdE,"Abusive parents are not common at all.  If they were, many more people would be in prison and society would look at parents differently.  Also, abusive kinda falls into the authoritarian category."
fyO8pvpnTdE,I’m 13 and still with them and I have nobody
fyO8pvpnTdE,That would be the worst kind of parents.
fyO8pvpnTdE,My parent treated me the same way and I also went to be programmer. Coincidence? I think not
fyO8pvpnTdE,"I’m lucky, my dad wanted me to be a programmer because he said that’s where the money is, and I naturally came to pursue that on."
fyO8pvpnTdE,"@Special K12 Oh okay. Thank you so much. Actually authoritative and authoritarian are two very different styles. There&#39;s an overwhelming consensus that authoritative is the best form of parenting whereas authoritarian is supposed to produce anxious, maladjusted children. <br><br>But that aside, when I wrote the script I just chose random names for the video. I had no say in these illustrations, but I&#39;m sure it wasn&#39;t deliberate"
fyO8pvpnTdE,"@Avanti Giridharan oh hello, this was well done, great job 🙂. I was referring to both Authoritative and Authoritarian. I just grouped them both together and called them “strict”. I’m not sure if it was intentional but I noticed those two parenting styles featured Asian and Black caricatures and I was wondering if there was meaning behind those groups representing those parenting styles."
fyO8pvpnTdE,"Hi, I wrote this video. I was a little confused with your comment. Did you mean Authoritative or Authoritarian?"
fyO8pvpnTdE,"@Eliza E I am black which is why I pointed this out. I think a better video would be on the forms of parenting from the perspective of other races. I think the video kind of makes it seem like any style of parenting can be applied to any child which is true but it&#39;s not practical our society. It&#39;s like you said, the stricter parents are usually of other races because freedom in childhood is not our luxury"
fyO8pvpnTdE,"You must understand the narrative of Asians and Blacks. We had to be constantly proving ourselves and through the various parenting tactics, it reinforces it. Blacks/Asian cannot slack off because we are judged harshly. The White people can parent or behave free or unbothered because they do not need to prove themselves. They already have a system that will make it easy for them, so why parent &quot;harshly &quot;. I hope it makes sense... History and Colonialism does impact how one navigates life."
fyO8pvpnTdE,"@Avanti Giridharan  yee &gt;w&lt; lmao.  Alright peace. Dont worry I&#39;m a quarter of black, Hispanic and Asian. Call me the Apex Tex"
fyO8pvpnTdE,@Deputy .J you&#39;re very sweet 💕

fyO8pvpnTdE,@Avanti Giridharan it is.
fyO8pvpnTdE,@Deputy .J Yeah born and raised in India. India is in Asia. But yes I get that a lot. I don&#39;t look like my parents neither do I look Asian. Very funny
fyO8pvpnTdE,@Avanti Giridharan thanks a lot
fyO8pvpnTdE,I&#39;m so happy for you
fyO8pvpnTdE,@Sylver Rain what was that
fyO8pvpnTdE,Idk...you should watch ‘Dead Poets Society.’

fyO8pvpnTdE,Exactly! 😄😄
fyO8pvpnTdE,Thank you so much. I appreciate your inputs.
fyO8pvpnTdE,Thanks 🙏
fyO8pvpnTdE,Isn&#39;t it? I was taught this when I was 15 in school. I was going through my old textbooks when I got the idea of writing g about it for a video
fyO8pvpnTdE,Interesting observation
fyO8pvpnTdE,yea that&#39;s a pretty good childhood man. you learned boundaries and was given space to grow and learn responsibility and consequences.
fyO8pvpnTdE,"@Dorito legend I need to go to bed until 10:30pm, so when I found out most of my mates went to bed at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyO8pvpnTdE&amp;t=11m00s"">11:00</a>+, I was like 😳&quot;you guys sleep when you want&quot;"
fyO8pvpnTdE,@flowey fanboy way more strict than my parents lol<br>I litteraly can use my phone anytime I want and since my school is just handing out papers and I answer them I sleep very late sometimes

fyO8pvpnTdE,@DPierre thanks
fyO8pvpnTdE,@Avanti Giridharan well done
fyO8pvpnTdE,I&#39;m 18 too. And I wrote the script 🤣
fyO8pvpnTdE,It&#39;s not something you&#39;re supposed to do alone.
fyO8pvpnTdE,@Low ChinAnn i love how you put it! Dynamics in our lives...thank you for sharing!
fyO8pvpnTdE,"@theFitty yes, we should accept ourself for who we are. Although I am often self contradicting, but on the bright side, it gives me two opposite perspective like in the cartoon shows where angel and devil co exist in the character though."
fyO8pvpnTdE,@Low ChinAnn are you learning to accept the way that you are today?
fyO8pvpnTdE,I think mine is the combination of all styles and I grew up to be a contradictive person.
fyO8pvpnTdE,@Lekha are you in a good relationship with them today?
fyO8pvpnTdE,@GJ Va the terms are old from psychology used for decades. Maybe something New would fit better but these people recognize
fyO8pvpnTdE,I think the name should be Balanced parenting. The term Authoritative and Authoritarian are too similar and easy to confuse.  Parenting and all life in general is about balance.
fyO8pvpnTdE,Actually there&#39;s an overwhelming amount of consensus that authoritative parenting produces better adjusted and more successful children.
fyO8pvpnTdE,@study tips I hope you meet people who do listen
fyO8pvpnTdE,@study tips meditation?
fyO8pvpnTdE,@airbatt same hereeeee most painful situation when nobody available to listen our problem.problem are not big as we imagine if anyone listen to it carefully.
fyO8pvpnTdE,"Me <a href=""http://too.it/"">too.it</a> is so difficult to reprograme our mind.let me know some affirmationadd plz"
fyO8pvpnTdE,Hmm suspicious...<br>SOMEONE ELSE SAID THAT!<br>That parent who criticizes their kids for doing something wrong yet doesn&#39;t execute control over them!
fyO8pvpnTdE,"@Hakim Diwan yeah but I think they want to get their point of view on what it is. Just like they mentioned in their comment, they think the definition of what a helicopter parent can be different mean differently to people."
fyO8pvpnTdE,@Krstna6  They literally explained in video what Helicopter parents are.
fyO8pvpnTdE,"@Krstna6 it the fifth style of parenting, they mentioned. It just  another word for it the one I more familiar with."
fyO8pvpnTdE,"I feel like I&#39;ve heard this name for parenting covering too broad a definition. What is one person&#39;s idea of helicoptering is not another&#39;s idea of it. Genuinely curious, what is helicopter parenting to you?"
fyO8pvpnTdE,"@Krstna6 Of course in life and a lot of topics there is not one correct answer like it is a quiz. It is something complicated, viewed in a lot of ways and perceived differently by every parent and every child. However even if there is no correct answer/way to raise a child you can still personally think that something is better. As you said maybe leaving your child to explore and play alone is good but in my opinion and in the way that I grew up and saw others growing up I do not agree that this way can be effective in the same way. I cannot accept for example the totally do whatever you want parents or the if you dont bring an A+ everyday from school you die parents."
fyO8pvpnTdE,"Im glad you are happy with the way you were raised. Your explanation here is exactly why people saying there is only one good way to parent drives me crazy. There are books out there about attachment parenting and all the negative issues it can lead to. This could make a parent feel like they&#39;re not really supposed to help or play with their child but instead sit back and observe, let the child learn and play on their own. Ive heard people even go so far as to call a parent that helps a child onto a jungle gym at the park a &quot;helicopter&quot; parent. We need to stop putting so much emphasis on what NOT to do, because then people are too afraid to even come close that, and instead talk more about what TO do, which is implementing a healthy balance of the styles. Extreme opinions on the &quot;right&quot; and &quot;wrong&quot; ways to parent leads to too much judgment."
fyO8pvpnTdE,same with me!
fyO8pvpnTdE,🥰😍🤩
fyO8pvpnTdE,Thanks for the nuanced perspective
fyO8pvpnTdE,Thanks for the insights
fyO8pvpnTdE,Yes. Baby Jahre - but it’s German.
fyO8pvpnTdE,Yes
fyO8pvpnTdE,Very true. The spectrum is endless
fyO8pvpnTdE,"I can understand , they are doing their best but people whats their best is not best for the child."
fyO8pvpnTdE,Same 😔😔
fyO8pvpnTdE,"Feel u bro. Tbh, actually I became quite the opposite of what this video predicts."
fyO8pvpnTdE,I&#39;m so sorry about that!
fyO8pvpnTdE,Sorry to hear that 🙏
fyO8pvpnTdE,Neglectful is definitely bad
fyO8pvpnTdE,@Rashmi Shetti Haha does it? I live in India😂😂 I live in Mumbai
fyO8pvpnTdE,@Anas Qiblawi Thank you. I&#39;m working on a new video for sprouts right now

fyO8pvpnTdE,Beautiful work. I teach human development at a university; I’m going to use this video in class.
fyO8pvpnTdE,write more please
fyO8pvpnTdE,"Nowadays? For what i see, most of people never knew."
fyO8pvpnTdE,"@Dont Misunderstand EXACTLY, if the child wantss to listen, I don&#39;t know if you are then saying that&#39;s it&#39;s easy to be the parent you are supposed to be, and do what you must but the child not following is then their choice and would then not make you a bad parent, and it indeed doesn&#39;t make you a bad parent,  but the mere fact that your child may disobey,  as teenagers would, in and of itself makes parenting hard, because they disregarded guidance. And no you don&#39;t need to know every secret your child has in order to do your job as a parent. But without a doubt a lack of communication or understanding or what the child is going through, which could be a (mental issue, friend issues etc) does affect how well you can help them. And it&#39;s not easy to device and know how to deal with the array of mental issues, how they affect people how it affects your child and how to deal with it. Many parents continue raising their child in the regular way not knowing how they have to switch it to accommodate a mental issue a child has been hiding, and a mental issue in no way is a reflection of bad parenting. So not knowing things can make things harder. And many teenagers have mental issues, especially depression. <br><br>It&#39;s weird how you preach manipulation yet say, &quot;force them to live with the consequences.&quot;<br><br>And it is as a result or having a more developed brain why they will avoid guidance, possibly get into trouble and take a toll on the parent, which makes parenting hard. <br><br>Very, very rarely. VERY RARE, will a teenager ever listen to every advice without question, to the point of possibly breaking it, even if they understand it. And some things teenagers do parents will never know about and through the parents advice they learn and make better decisions. So that means most teenagers are not being manipulated, especially because in most cases we really can&#39;t be (a rebellious stage), just saying. And that then means parenting is still hard without any manipulation involved.<br><br>I think your overall view is that you can do your job and the child can choose what to do, but it&#39;s not as easy to just guide and then the child does something rash and you say, &quot;This job is easy because I told them the right thing&quot;, because their decision took a toll on you, and some things you reallyexpected your child to make better decisions about, so it can be really stressing, especially if they continually disregard simple advice that can benefit them and they see the adverse effects but still choose to be stubborn.  Your view can be applied to many families, including mine. They guide me well and are good people so I indeed can use that to help shape myself. And my parents and many other don&#39;t find parenting hard because the child isn&#39;t following every single thing they are told to do, as you said, manipulation is wrong and they don&#39;t manipulate their children, but as a result of the child disregarding simple things that can hurt them, being rude to parents with no regard, being ungrateful, being selfish (which is a common trait for teenagers), all those factors combined make it hard so you can just look at it from one view and it&#39;s automatically easy.<br>And many times parents know when a child is hiding something they shouldn&#39;t be doing and such, but they leave the child alone and let them deal with and don&#39;t intervene. And then the child is shocked to know their parents knew, because a lot of parents have good intuition for certain things and were once children, so they know. And for the other things that the parents didn&#39;t know about, the child gets through it by using advice parents gave. And many times it&#39;s after a bad decision they see how their parents were right and they make better decisions and appreciate their parents more.<br><br><br>And as I said, some guidance they will just not understand until they get older.<br><br>May I ask if you are a psychologist or have kids?"
fyO8pvpnTdE,"@Debonae Simpson It&#39;s not an assumption. The only possible way a more developed brain would make parenting more difficult is if your parenting technique relied on manipulation. That&#39;s just a factual statement. If teenagers are more difficult to raise, it&#39;s because your parenting style revolves around manipulation. Period.<br><br>I will say this. It is not a parent&#39;s duty to keep their child out of trouble, nor is it a parent&#39;s duty to choose the type of person they become. Keep them safe, yes. Teach them how to make their own decisions, and force them to live with the consequences of those decisions. There is not a single secret a teenager could keep that a parent needs to know about in order to do their job as a parent. A parent is not there to tell the child how to live their life, it&#39;s to give them the tools they need to figure it out on their own. Any advice a parent gives is only ever useful if the child wants to listen.<br><br>If your child listens and obeys no matter what, you&#39;re a terrible parent. It means very directly that you&#39;ve failed to give them the tools they need to make decisions for themselves.<br><br><br>You are right. It&#39;s very hard to watch a person you care for go down the wrong path. Especially if it&#39;s a person you&#39;re supposed to be responsible for. However... if you can&#39;t handle that, you&#39;re not ready to be a parent. You shouldn&#39;t be having children if you can&#39;t handle them growing up."
fyO8pvpnTdE,"@Dont Misunderstand Smh. I&#39;m not a parent but you assume my way of thinking is centered around some sort of manipulation, it&#39;s not. As I said you can teach a child and show all the right things, behave the right way and the child chooses otherwise. Really not as easy as that. But that&#39;s your view and that&#39;s fine. I  would say teenagers are harder, because their brains are developed. Children are more receptive when younger that&#39;s why it&#39;s important to teach them good things from a young age. Teenagers will deliberately be stubborn and even when you guide them they disobey and think they can manage things and they can&#39;t. I&#39;m 17 talking about myself and thousands of other teenagers that can relate to being disobedient and thinking they are old enough to make certain decisions and not listen to guidance. And teenagers can be very stubborn. It&#39;s a very crucial part in development and many parents raising teenagers will say that the child was easier to handle when younger. Teenagers nowadays are also very force riped. Doing and exposing themselves to things they are not ready for. And with social media and peer pressure and such, it&#39;s much easier said than done to just be a good person and they mimic or help them to make the best conclusions and they follow. You can be the best guider but if the person chooses not to listen, you can do so much and no more. <br><br>And it&#39;s hard to see your child go down a certain path and hope that they will take heed to what you said, and it doesn&#39;t always go that way where they listen. <br><br>And don&#39;t let teenagers fool you. A parent will think a teenager is the sweetest child in the world and the child is doing many things behind the parents back that they shouldn&#39;t. Many teenagers use that as a smoke screen to do certain things they shouldn&#39;t.<br><br>I don&#39;t know if you are a parent, or someone just trying to give the best advice. I&#39;m not arguing with you in any way. But if you are someone outside of parenting looking in, it is much easier to say and give advice that on paper seems best but in practice is really challenging. And every child is different and will reject and accept different teaching and guidance styles. <br><br>If you are raising a teen. I don&#39;t know you so I really can&#39;t judge. Be vigilant. Teenagers aren&#39;t always what they seem when reacting a certain way towards parents.<br><br>Some things teenagers will also never see or understand until they become and adult and are parents themselves. And especially when a teenager believes that their friend or a person they are maybe in a relationship with (at a suitable age that their parents would allow) is doing and telling them things are for their good, they are willing to disregard some parental teachings for the person. And as I said teenagers are very secretive so sometimes it&#39;s not easy to find the best ways to guide them, because you don&#39;t know the full information."
fyO8pvpnTdE,I bet 😂 tell us later!
fyO8pvpnTdE,these could all fit into one of these 5 categories- abuse isn&#39;t a parenting style. abusive parents will usually fall under authoritarian parenting or a combination of the parenting styles.
fyO8pvpnTdE,"@Dr. Annu Jhajhria Of course there&#39;s a full spectrum. But if I were to have included all of them, the video would never have ended. So we thought it best to keep it to 5."
fyO8pvpnTdE,@Avanti Giridharan what about narcissistic parents who r subtle with the abuse? There&#39;s a lot more parenting styles
fyO8pvpnTdE,"Oh thanks for the input! I should have included it, but since it clashed with the authoritarian style, I thought it would be best to leave it out"
fyO8pvpnTdE,"@Vapouet Likewise, Thank you. We got this."
fyO8pvpnTdE,"@Irish_HandGrenade96 Oh man i feel you. So i think its good that we know about this and acknowledge it, and then heal and learn from it as future parents.<br>Wish you well dude. Everything will get better, it starts with us really :) we can&#39;t change other people but we can change ourselves. Much love to you"
fyO8pvpnTdE,@Vapouet I&#39;m a middle child of 3. Only boy. My mother never spent much time with us and my dad is a cop so he was always working after the divorce. My older sister needed love and attention and never got it. She broke me to the point of mental breakdowns and i didn&#39;t learn at the time. I ended up doing the same to my younger sister. We all emotionally and verbally destroyed eachother. To young to realize it. All our personalities were effected. My sisters are very charming but callus. Im very insecure and people notice it because im a fairly handsome kid but carry myself sad at times. Im bi polar like my mother. Recently diagnosed.
fyO8pvpnTdE,"@Sprouts as a big sister, i feel really guilty for not being the big sister that my sister needed, as i was in my teens and was affected by my parents&#39; parenting. I was disciplining my sister in a way i shouldn&#39;t have, and i feel this has affected her personality too."
fyO8pvpnTdE,@Sprouts what about only children?
fyO8pvpnTdE,Thanks!
fyO8pvpnTdE,It needs to require an endorsement like on a license
fyO8pvpnTdE,"As a parent of two I disagree, parenting is challenging, but also beautiful and rewarding - you get to build by far the best and most meaningful relationship with another human being (or beings) in your life."
fyO8pvpnTdE,As a parent of two I can confirm.
fyO8pvpnTdE,Sprouts thanks for all the great content in digestible form
fyO8pvpnTdE,Thanks a ton
fyO8pvpnTdE,"up. same here, great video"

7JmprpRIsEY,@Abigail Barber lmao
7JmprpRIsEY,Actually some songs have depth in it which are my fav.for some pop songs they also have layers and layers of beat that requires alot of attention to notice it but for Mozart songs it&#39;s easy to recognize it
7JmprpRIsEY,"It depends on the artist of the pop. Bts is actually my favourite because not only does their music have many layers, but their lyrics and music videos do."
7JmprpRIsEY,Different people different preferences

7JmprpRIsEY,"Well, it&#39;s a somewhat controversial experiment, but it&#39;s been argued that listening to Mozart&#39;s music can improve the performance of certain mental tasks. It may just be a myth, but as you pointed out, Mozart&#39;s music is so enjoyable it can&#39;t hurt to have it on in the background whilst studying or working 😉"
7JmprpRIsEY,Hahaha me
7JmprpRIsEY,"Some of these pieces were recorded live so that&#39;s why you may hear background noises, especially if listening with headphones. Sorry about that - hope you still enjoyed the compilation!"

7JmprpRIsEY,"Jacob Zondag Jacob Zondag thank you for your message. First I wanted to write a more serious description, but are really such short compositions worth such powerful words? This album is a collection of musical notes. All the compositions appeared very quickly. When you listened you found out that they are very-very short. Of course I invite you to listen to it again, to buy it, or to share it. I am a young composer and sharing is the most helpful thing for me. The dog shown on the picture is a very pretty local mongrel:))"
7JmprpRIsEY,"Thanks for the invite. I was currently listening to Queen (yes, Queen) and I interrupted it to give your creativity a slot while I&#39;m working. I think you did a rather good job. I enjoyed particularly the variation. Some parts could even be used as scores in a couple of movies I know, that&#39;s how good I think it is. Btw I loved the dog. He looks a bit like Laika, doesn&#39;t it? For the record: Christmas time is a time like any other and dreams stay dreams,, that&#39;s why they&#39;re called dreams. But don&#39;t let that keep you from enjoying yourself. If permitted: The description &quot;All you need to know about LIFE, love and death (in vibes that thrill the mind)&quot; sounds way better than &quot;About everything around us: weather, love and death&quot;. Just saying..."

7JmprpRIsEY,"because there&#39;s no research proving that it&#39;s somehow better than other predictable music without lyrics?<br>Depending on circumstance, yes. Belief can go a long way. For instance, if you go to a catholic high school (like I did), pretending to believe or actually believing in God can help you to not get ostracized. Outside of situations like that and maybe believing that you&#39;ll get to a certain point in life (as visualization has been proven to help people attain goals), belief is pretty pointless imo."

7JmprpRIsEY,What do you do with this &quot;created from nothing&quot; power after that?
7JmprpRIsEY,"+Pete Totaro I&#39;d say that in every genre of music, there&#39;s good and bad. Often people with lesser intellect will listen to bad music of whatever genre they like, though it&#39;s not 100% true, it&#39;s just an observation I&#39;ve made. For example, in metal music, I always find that Iron Maiden and Metallica fans seems stupid and uneducated, where Meshuggah&#39;s, Animals as Leaders or Dream Theater fans act like intelligent people, most of the time."

7JmprpRIsEY,What does it matter whether it&#39;s a placebo as long as it works
7JmprpRIsEY,its all placebo.
7JmprpRIsEY,I think Classical Music is good for your brain in general. Probably any music for that matter.
7JmprpRIsEY,"From the Wikipedia article: &#39;&#39;Many scholars in the psychological community now view the claim that playing classical music to children can boost their intelligence to be a &quot;myth.&quot; &#39;&#39;. <br><br>There is clear effect on the brain from music in general thats not chaotic, for example positively in concentration and attention for people with deficiencies in it. Can also help with moods and anxiety."
7JmprpRIsEY,Gamer Saga n
7JmprpRIsEY,So true
7JmprpRIsEY,"No es solo para estudiar,pero ayuda mucho porque sos mas concentrado."
7JmprpRIsEY,"¿De dónde sacan que es solo para estudiar? A veces es tan intensa la emoción de escuchar una pieza de estas, que concentrarse es poco menos que imposible."
7JmprpRIsEY,music probably is the ultimate source of meanings for language may be a side product of music.

7JmprpRIsEY,"Ed Vega That has actually already been done, I&#39;m sorry I forget which YouTube channel it is one. Ironically, someone complained that composers would be upset if they knew they music was used in Disney, Warner Bros., etc films. I think that&#39;s a ridiculous thing to complain about. People are being exposed to classical music without realizing it. A few yrs ago some purists were up in arms because the leading male character in Twilight, played Clair de Lune, and how Debussy would turn over in his grave. Imagine just one movie goer being turned on to classical music from hearing it in a teen chick flick. Is that such a bad thing?"

ZAI1f3tUoJU,Very happy if it is used by students
ZAI1f3tUoJU,Totally agree with your concept of how children learn. But learning needs cognition which is through the ways that is explained I  the video  as per the assumptions of Jean Piaget. Amidst critics  this theory is accepted universally.

fi6596_RUNQ,@Jason Roberts this^
fi6596_RUNQ,Exactly. Don’t let them in the house period. The child will thank you when they’re older.
fi6596_RUNQ,Ah yes wait till they call child protection services
fi6596_RUNQ,"no, thats just stupid, let kids play games"
fi6596_RUNQ,"The problem is you have to put in effort for love and there isn&#39;t a unlimited supply. Whereas videogames have infinite rewards that trigger dopamine. Same thing with porn, endless supply of new &quot;partners&quot; so you get the reward without putting in the work."

fi6596_RUNQ,"Also, Ok Boomer"
fi6596_RUNQ,"Games quite possibly changed my life. My mother after giving birth to me and my brothers went through terrible depression and had to urge to kill us and herself. My dad threatened to divorce if she was going to threaten their children. He has been a gamer since the 80s and I have no doubt that those helped him relax during the greatest stress he had ever had. If you think that he is &quot;useless&quot; because of games, you are stupid. He works in IT at the Cleveland Clinic here in Ohio and is pretty much world renowned for what he does. He was among the first to do what he does and has awards to prove it."
fi6596_RUNQ,What? I hope this is satire
fi6596_RUNQ,"I hope this is a joke, if not you need help"
fi6596_RUNQ,I hope this is Satire

fi6596_RUNQ,you are indian
fi6596_RUNQ,He&#39;s mad cuz you turned off his console and he hadn&#39;t saved for the last one and a half hour
fi6596_RUNQ,"Thats why letting a 8 Years old on a PC isn&#39;t that great.<br>Wait till their Teens or something, but not as a Child lol"
fi6596_RUNQ,I am saying this in my experience
fi6596_RUNQ,Too much gaming is not good
fi6596_RUNQ,The one thing is a kid raging over game and The parents make the kid so so rage
fi6596_RUNQ,Go feel the sun
fi6596_RUNQ,True
fi6596_RUNQ,Boomers in a nutshell
fi6596_RUNQ,It&#39;s like blaming hot wheels for car crashes

fi6596_RUNQ,3.the whole save game gets corrupted
fi6596_RUNQ,"@Idk myname Great hypothetical question. I don’t watch football or any other sport really anymore because to me they are a waste of time.  I personally, never just shut off my kids games without giving them an opportunity to get to a good stopping point.  After a couple of warnings that I’m about to shut it off I walk over and shut it off.  If they have concerns or complaints, I listen calmly and explain to them that I had given them opportunities to stop on their own and get to a stopping point.  So far I’ve had a few gripes but no meltdowns because I warn them first of what will happen."

fi6596_RUNQ,@Manoviraj Karkera you dont
fi6596_RUNQ,they are siding with the child why would they do that? its most likely someone who disagrees
fi6596_RUNQ,No it&#39;s bcoz they hav brains
fi6596_RUNQ,pc also has a plug..
fi6596_RUNQ,@Борис Владков your just addicted
fi6596_RUNQ,well looks like they are not helping your english<br>try video games they are fun<br>and 90% of what they said in this video isnt true<br>some people play for 1 or 2 hours<br>some play for 6 hours or more but if you <br>dont eat drink or sleep to play video games<br>then its an addiction if you just play video games for 6 hours<br>its fine unless again you dont feed your pets you dont <br>do anything then its a problem
fi6596_RUNQ,there are screen time limit settings
fi6596_RUNQ,video games relive stress just set a screen time limit
fi6596_RUNQ,dont you dare do that
fi6596_RUNQ,lol
fi6596_RUNQ,HAHAHAHA. They should see how much EVO pays the finalists.
fi6596_RUNQ,"especially csgo, unless you ask people to kick you from the game."
fi6596_RUNQ,you also have teammates you need to support in most games
fi6596_RUNQ,yeah

fi6596_RUNQ,@LinusMethTips no lol once people start realizing it decreases their life by 25 years
fi6596_RUNQ,@Jatt  II bro you are literally insane Of course games exist And are popular And they will be for decades
fi6596_RUNQ,Games died out in 2020 and much more in 2021 and where it&#39;s the point that they don&#39;t exist in 2022
fi6596_RUNQ,yeah pushes it through the algorithm so more people can know that video games are good
fi6596_RUNQ,He was acting so controlled for someone that was so mistreated by someone you should be able to trust. WSJ thought they made a point with this?!
fi6596_RUNQ,@David Schweighofer yeah i would do that to....
fi6596_RUNQ,they were real
fi6596_RUNQ,why?....
fi6596_RUNQ,BRUH don&#39;t tell me adults don&#39;t use the phobr 24/7
fi6596_RUNQ,@Idk myname dude this argument is over why are you still talking about it
fi6596_RUNQ,@torenonion dude I’m young too why would I have a kid ?
fi6596_RUNQ,"@Jwet Bagger also I don&#39;t think you read the other comment i said: Take some advice from a gamer who has straight A’s. Gaming is just like art, you have lots of fun! But this generation doesn’t like art as much as the past generation. For example, in this video it showed them getting mad right? the reason for them getting mad is not because of the game it’s because they unplugged the game. Think of it as if you destroy someones art. They would be mad right? Same thing. You don’t have to but i suggest you play Minecraft or Animal Crossing with your kid if you have one. I really thing you would find it quite fun! Please take this advice and do not hate on young gamers."
fi6596_RUNQ,@Jwet Bagger uh ok? that was my opinion
fi6596_RUNQ,@torenonion first of all this comment was 2 months ago second of all I’m stating my opinion
fi6596_RUNQ,@Bart lol my mom sometimes uses it until 2 am
fi6596_RUNQ,Mom be like YOU CAN&#39;T USE YOUR PHONE  BUT I CAN!
fi6596_RUNQ,He just laughed at a kid having a breakdown.
fi6596_RUNQ,lol
fi6596_RUNQ,yeah theres age ratings time limits parental settings i dont get it
fi6596_RUNQ,@torenonion you make no sense
fi6596_RUNQ,@torenonion no
fi6596_RUNQ,@Jwet Bagger oh wait cooking and a coding and reading and eating and sleeping and basically any hobby isn’t addictive?
fi6596_RUNQ,@torenonion i dont really think its old people who hate gamers i think its middle ages around 35-50
fi6596_RUNQ,top 3 idiots in this video:<br>parents recording themselves not being a good role model<br><br>news figuring this out 30 years later<br><br>old people in the comments not understanding
fi6596_RUNQ,Ok
fi6596_RUNQ,😂😂
fi6596_RUNQ,@Jwet Bagger you really don’t understand? do you? i have straight A’s i’m a professional scripter i could get a job as a typer because my typing speed is 53 wpm and i’m only 14.
fi6596_RUNQ,Education is better than gaming all day you’ll see when you fail classes
fi6596_RUNQ,@Allen The Skywalker what game? if it was an autosave game that&#39;s probably why
fi6596_RUNQ,@torenonion that’s happened to me and I don’t rage like this
fi6596_RUNQ,or maybe because they just unplugged something that was a one time opportunity....
fi6596_RUNQ,So true
fi6596_RUNQ,@Mr.Bright 2.0 nerd
fi6596_RUNQ,Satisfaction never ends
fi6596_RUNQ,@Kitty you don&#39;t finish the game you set goals and you finish those goals.
fi6596_RUNQ,yeah.
fi6596_RUNQ,"@Jwet Bagger Take some advice from a gamer who has straight A’s. Gaming is just like art, you have lots of fun! But this generation doesn’t like art as much as the past generation.

fi6596_RUNQ,They’ll see
fi6596_RUNQ,@Dakota Jones your opinion
fi6596_RUNQ,"none of that is interesting, why draw when you could draw and create a whole world in game development, and interact with it. or make a show/comic/novel. tv and especially video games is just evolved art"
fi6596_RUNQ,The generals in Halo infinite definitely come to mind. They are extremely tough on legendary.
fi6596_RUNQ,how lol
fi6596_RUNQ,Exactly
fi6596_RUNQ,yeah back then it was books and stuff so they dont get it now lol
fi6596_RUNQ,"There are not really many concerns, and blaming the adults in these situations are correct. They unplugged a console with a game you need to save. Think of it as if you were reading a book and the book mark was the save part. Someone takes your book mark out and shuts the book throws it away and you get mad right? This is what the adults are doing. You need to be a role model not someone your kids look at as a terrorist. The only concern i can think of is them not spending time with you. I suggest you play a nice game like Animal crossing or Minecraft with your kids. Minecraft costs $30 but i think its worth it. If you think there are other concerns I suggest you set a time limit of 3-4 hours a day."
fi6596_RUNQ,"they are basically saying if you get mad at something you like being destroyed or cancelled, your brain isn&#39;t developed. if you get mad, your brain isn&#39;t developed is what they are saying."
fi6596_RUNQ,"You need to think of it as if you did lots of paperwork for a job interview and someone threw it all away, thats how the kids feel"
fi6596_RUNQ,@Nicole Diaz Ma’am all he said was why...
fi6596_RUNQ,@NiceBreakfast seriously?
fi6596_RUNQ,Why
fi6596_RUNQ,i would throw away their life support away
fi6596_RUNQ,oh i thought you were saying video games are bad
fi6596_RUNQ,@Irina Sabou thats a lie if she unplugged a console or computer while your about to win you would be mad
fi6596_RUNQ,@NiceBreakfast yeah but i help her when she needs something and idc if i  save or not because i always start over and i&#39;m sorry if my grammar is bad but i am from another country and i learned my self english😥😀
fi6596_RUNQ,@I probably don&#39;t like you my mom did it one time but i got bored so all i did was just going out whit my frends and stop  being such a game kid i don&#39;t know but i am now the kind of kid that just loves netflix😂
fi6596_RUNQ,@Andrew the fat Watso bruh rlly you are such a hater and i am a girl so i don&#39;t play on console and i lost my interest in games that was now 4 weeks so yeah👁👄👁😑
fi6596_RUNQ,"That’s lies, you will get mad if your mother plugged out your console."
fi6596_RUNQ,People that destroy ipads and consoles if their child “talks back” after the parent unplugs the console when they are about to win: garbage truck that gets burnt at a cemetery
fi6596_RUNQ,yeah
fi6596_RUNQ,i develop games and do youtube but no one over 40 knows that its a job....
fi6596_RUNQ,@Trains And planes830 r/woosh

fi6596_RUNQ,What does that have to do with anything
fi6596_RUNQ,@Harp Seal i think hes a nine year old who tried to make a joke?
fi6596_RUNQ,What’s an alpoly
fi6596_RUNQ,"yeah I agree sometimes I multi-task gaming and studying though, honestly it may help since its reliving stress and that&#39;s why I have staright A&#39;s lol"

fi6596_RUNQ,@TheHitman They will be the rage monster 💀
fi6596_RUNQ,"Don&#39;t do anything to them that you wouldn&#39;t want to have done to yourself. Exactly right. I bet if I unplugged an adults computer while they were working on it, they would be just as upset as these kids."
fi6596_RUNQ,I would like stop their water supply while they are showering .
fi6596_RUNQ,👍
fi6596_RUNQ,Yeah okay I have better things to do stop commenting on this
fi6596_RUNQ,@CyruxSpark if you are painting something and someone ruins it arent you going to get angry too<br>specialy if they record it
fi6596_RUNQ,<b>insert meme - ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?</b><br>I mean I&#39;m not that kind of person who gets angry for someone putting my water bottle somewhere else. There are just people who get angry like that. Plenty of people in my school who are like that and most of them don&#39;t play video games.
fi6596_RUNQ,"The reason you didn&#39;t get upset when the router shut off was because it was no one&#39;s fault and no one intentionally turned it off. When someone does something to you on purpose that you don&#39;t like, your reaction is gonna be different than if something happened by accident."
fi6596_RUNQ,yeah when the parent unplugged something that they spent hours on that they cant get back means that it was the video games fault
fi6596_RUNQ,Let me qoute &quot;it&#39;s video games foult not my bad parenting&quot;
fi6596_RUNQ,-_- they reacted like that because you just threw away a 1 time opportunity
fi6596_RUNQ,😂
fi6596_RUNQ,@Monkefighta 😂 yeah probably .
fi6596_RUNQ,@John Wick or they are too dumb because there prefrontal cortex is messed up
fi6596_RUNQ,I think they read it but too afraid to reply 🤣😂
fi6596_RUNQ,@Bakshi Anchal i hope your kids dont hate you later on
fi6596_RUNQ,@Bakshi Anchal I hope your kids dont talk to you and ignore you (:
fi6596_RUNQ,"@Spino Science honey, I just realised you are too small to understand the jist of this whole thing.. No problem, take care.. Have a blessed life ahead!"
fi6596_RUNQ,"@Bakshi Anchal lol you are just morally wrong,and are parenting the wrong way... trust me video games are good as long as your kids study and get A’s"
fi6596_RUNQ,"Bruh the kids spent time in online games, probably helping their friends in the game and the last kid was in a hard boss in a game and looked like the kid was going to beat it then their entitled parents come and unplug whitout permission bruh. You think its ok ? And they also make their kids upset and record them. Entitled people thay do such things don&#39;t deserve rights."
fi6596_RUNQ,Imagine ur kid spend 10 hours of playing games then u unplug it...
fi6596_RUNQ,True we humans shouldn’t judge people because we aren’t God.
fi6596_RUNQ,no such thing mc takes hours to complete roblox has tons of games fortnite lasts up to 30 mins among us lasts up to 20 mins theres not many other games for kids that they will like
fi6596_RUNQ,(this just a joke okay)<br>mom: unplug xbox<br>me:quiet and go to bed<br>mom: 😀<br> years later.....<br>mom:i need my medicine<br>me:No (unplug the life support)
fi6596_RUNQ,Lol
fi6596_RUNQ,or they just deleted 3 hours of progress they diddnt save
fi6596_RUNQ,entitled ppl vs logical ppl
fi6596_RUNQ,@CoolgamerJAW well said and I 100% agree with you
fi6596_RUNQ,Yes in my opinion it’s like bullying let’s see how the parents react if someone unplugs the TV while on a sport game or something on TV that parents like
fi6596_RUNQ,IKR
fi6596_RUNQ,"i know right, i played mc so now i wanna go punch some trees"
fi6596_RUNQ,Relatable
fi6596_RUNQ,no not really but they spent hours on that and then deleted it
fi6596_RUNQ,Roasted but true facts man
fi6596_RUNQ,true especially with covid even though we are fully vaccinated we cant go to alot of places
fi6596_RUNQ,I agree too
fi6596_RUNQ,succu13us i agree
fi6596_RUNQ,please tell me the baby sitter is fired
fi6596_RUNQ,yep
fi6596_RUNQ,that one was scripted for sure
fi6596_RUNQ,is that you
fi6596_RUNQ,"@Evan Bush My point was, it&#39;s just for fun"
fi6596_RUNQ,@Mick3y6 I don&#39;t think I said anything to defend the parents if that&#39;s what your getting at.

fi6596_RUNQ,Its the same for them as well.
fi6596_RUNQ,Well football is more important than games
fi6596_RUNQ,@stranger add a 0
fi6596_RUNQ,And the parents who record this should be in prison for 20 years
fi6596_RUNQ,Agreed
fi6596_RUNQ,"i don&#39;t like WSJ anymore, because of this video"
fi6596_RUNQ,i think young or just funny teachers who understand will be fine
fi6596_RUNQ,i dont need to learn more.. even teachers are starting to agree
fi6596_RUNQ,yeah its like you took out the bookmark and slammed it shut
fi6596_RUNQ,also make sure to ask if its an online game which means they have teammates they need to support and ask if it will take longer then normal
fi6596_RUNQ,your parenting is really good
fi6596_RUNQ,One of the children was trying to get into the competence overwtach league which you have five chances of getting in so you can’t just keep on playing until you win and then his mom ubruptly turned it off which will most likely get him banned for a while /24 hours because of quitting early like she should of gave him a warning that she was going to end half and hour of progress
fi6596_RUNQ,Because they like to ignore any evidence that they don&#39;t like.
fi6596_RUNQ,They just do it as a prank tho in this vid not a punishment
fi6596_RUNQ,they wont
fi6596_RUNQ,he&#39;s also laughing at crying children and making him seem like a normal person by saying &quot;their prefrontal cortex isn&#39;t developed&quot;<br>anyone would get mad at things like this
fi6596_RUNQ,@Bart hippocrates the philosopher?
fi6596_RUNQ,@Mobloxme These people are hippocrates <br><br><br>Mom: Don&#39;t USE YOUR PHONE<br><br>Mom Again: Spending 10 hours on the phone
fi6596_RUNQ,"You wouldn&#39;t know right, because that was his chance to get in and he missed it so you&#39;ll never know if it&#39;s true."
fi6596_RUNQ,And the parents are still expecting their kids to love them and give them 80/100 of their money when they grow up.....
fi6596_RUNQ,@André Yes im already driving trucks and cars in euro truck and mudrunner X)
fi6596_RUNQ,"@Rawk if you have the gear and pedals to, learning to drive a real car will be easy for you when you are old enough"
fi6596_RUNQ,@André Its an expression lol.I drive a car on video games with my G-29
fi6596_RUNQ,Literally where on earth do they allow a 12 year old to drive a car?
fi6596_RUNQ,@Darth Dog But the addiction to the game is not intentional its more because you have fun.
fi6596_RUNQ,He looks like a failed clay sculpture
fi6596_RUNQ,"yea but the video is saying that if you react negatively to a parent who unplugs your game (any game, online or unsavable) that you spent time on for no reason, you&#39;re stupid and your prefrontal cortex is <i>CLEARLY</i> undeveloped"
fi6596_RUNQ,"As a person who plays games their is a simple way to stop your child without getting a bad reaction know what games they are playing there are 2 categories, 1st Single player games, this is a game which they can pause and save 2nd multiplayer games this is a game with real people playing them and you might say “well can’t they just pause too” no because when they pause is everyone else going to pause no, the way to get them off is look and ask, say hey after this match is over I need you to do the dishes or something keep in mind it may take a couple minutes that way they have a warning an not a abrupt get of now it’s a bad feeling when your friends are counting on you and you disappoint them at the last second and all that time you spent is ruined like if a document you have been working on for a long time is deleted so in conclusion know what type of game they are playing and warn them (not in a simple 15 min left type of deal )after your match is over because the time may be to short or too long and you can’t predict the time the match ends perfectly"
fi6596_RUNQ,I love eating and sleeping and family time which turns my addiction into a healthy routine
fi6596_RUNQ,"Lol, depends for me."
fi6596_RUNQ,by their own parent
fi6596_RUNQ,Yep

fi6596_RUNQ,Im playing through Halo infinite and i absolutely love it. I get a feeling of accomplishment out of beating the bosses not only because im aware of the atrocities they&#39;ve committed but because they are not pushovers in any regard and typically have a small battalion of covenant protecting them.

fi6596_RUNQ,I can’t disagree
fi6596_RUNQ,"@YeeterSnitzel i think he means that idiots buy everything,like games?<br><br>And that they make money off of stupid people or the game industry makes infinite money off of idiots that hat buy games and game stuff?<br><br><br>Yes idk what this person is saying but it seems bad"
fi6596_RUNQ,@Emir Latinović I’m not sure what you mean by that statement
fi6596_RUNQ,"@YeeterSnitzel as long there are idiots, money won&#39;t run out."
fi6596_RUNQ,@Emir Latinović now these days it actually can
fi6596_RUNQ,1 unsaved progress<br>2 multiplayer<br><br>None of those will bring salary to the family lol.
fi6596_RUNQ,At least it’s better than calling them stupid
fi6596_RUNQ,I think it&#39;s more accurate to say this was made by someone who&#39;s trying to justify wasting 100k on a psychology degree.<br><br>Everyone in the comment section can see how this is just a situation of pissing someone off by rudely interrupting and destroying their work.
fi6596_RUNQ,I can agree millennials are smarter lol
fi6596_RUNQ,Ok boomer
fi6596_RUNQ,why the parents don&#39;t just said turn off the xbox/ps now like Respect kids you gave no attention and you unplug they HAPPINESS
fi6596_RUNQ,@Filia M I agree.
fi6596_RUNQ,"@Theresa Miley &quot;I&#39;ll give it to you so I can take it away later, my parents did this to me so I&#39;ll do this to you.&quot;<br>It&#39;s what this tells me about those parents.<br>Wanted videogames to not get annoyed by their kids, now they annoy their kids for playing too much.<br>They should learn how to be respectful parents and not total narcissists and sadists."
fi6596_RUNQ,Yeah. And I don&#39;t get why they gave them video games in the first place if they don&#39;t want them to play. It looks to me like they were doing it just to be mean.
fi6596_RUNQ,take this 👑
fi6596_RUNQ,Respect your boldness sir
fi6596_RUNQ,"If someone turned off the pc during pantheon of hallownest, I would do that too. Its the hardest thing in Hollow Knight, with every single boss in the game in a row. And near the end, 3 extremely hard bosses. Nightmare King Grimm, Pure Vessel, and Absolute Radiance. If the pc got turned off fighting absolute radiance, I would NEVER forgive whoever did it since it takes a lot of skill to get to her, and you gotta get through every other boss"
fi6596_RUNQ,you get my badge of honour
fi6596_RUNQ,Ok boomers
fi6596_RUNQ,Hey some people might LOSE THEIR PROGRESS AND DO IT ALL OVER AGAIN. Imagine you’re working on a very important document and then someone erases everything you didn’t save. Yeah I would get mad too.

fi6596_RUNQ,@Trains And planes830 so about 7-9 million streamers who stream themselves playing video games and 7000 employees of wsj so how many of these streamers would be more successful than those 7000 employees?
fi6596_RUNQ,"@Trains And planes830 who said that....it&#39;s actually <b>maturity comes if you are kind,helpful and a little peaceful</b>"
fi6596_RUNQ,@Trains And planes830 I am a child that is why I am saying children are smarter than adults..and everyone is not a youtuber or streamer I agree
fi6596_RUNQ,great point cause the article takes hours
fi6596_RUNQ,@shazall711 there are rich people who make their money from playing games no?
fi6596_RUNQ,Gosh 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
fi6596_RUNQ,And what about the time you are losing in the game
fi6596_RUNQ,This is about game because it is no way importance but work is really important you won’t understand

fi6596_RUNQ,@The earth lol
fi6596_RUNQ,It&#39;s easy to dismiss this video because it&#39;s argument is dumb.<br><br>This isn&#39;t anything special about videogames. It&#39;s the same reaction anyone would have if someone else rudely interrupts and destroys their work/progress.
fi6596_RUNQ,Upload your gameplay to YT then
fi6596_RUNQ,I&#39;ve been playing Capcom &amp; SNK fighting games as well as JRPGs since i was a kid and still do. And as an adult im pursuing a mechanical engineering degree to build intelligent robots. Your move Wall street journal.

fi6596_RUNQ,That has never happened haha
fi6596_RUNQ,"Michel Bruns what if you have auto save off, I don’t know why auto save is off but then you have to manually do it and if you forget and then someone unplugs the console or pc then you have to start over from your last save and it’s probably been hours since your last manual save and even with auto save if you’re at the final boss and your console gets unplugged you have to start all the way from the first phase or if you’re lucky from the last boss checkpoint."
fi6596_RUNQ,@Four hour wait every one write stuff like &quot;i didnt save the game&quot; i dont know any modern game in which you have to save manually

fi6596_RUNQ,@Baha Yeşilyurt they are kids… they should not be punished because immature literally means not adult… if you think a kid should be punished for immaturity you are the parent that is pulling the plug<br><br>Would you interrupt the middle of your kids football game?<br>Or his school test? <br>Or shred his homework?<br>How about take away his limited childhood… ever think about that one? L I M I T E D
fi6596_RUNQ,@Baha Yeşilyurt yea
fi6596_RUNQ,"@BamHurger but kids aren’t aloud to speak back to their parents.  If I reacted like that to my dad when I was younger I would get backhanded across the face.  I don’t think it’s the child’s fault, it’s the parents."
fi6596_RUNQ,@Baha Yeşilyurt why has it got anything to do with being a kid? interrupt anything i’m competitively focusing on and I will be really mad
fi6596_RUNQ,"I’ve played chess for 5 <a href=""http://years.you/"">years.You</a>  mess up my game  then pray to god"

fi6596_RUNQ,@Antiquarian That is why I said it has nothing to do with prefrontal cortex.
fi6596_RUNQ,@Baha Yeşilyurt <br>So you would punish a kid for getting upset when you are the cause of getting them upset?
fi6596_RUNQ,@Hassan Hussain I&#39;d teach that doctor a lesson if he came to my face talking down to me for getting mad while playing.
fi6596_RUNQ,This is the best logic I’ve ever heard in my life good job you
fi6596_RUNQ,@Christian Acosta no
fi6596_RUNQ,"@Baha Yeşilyurt bro, u know nothing bout online games and how every match matters, u are probably that type of guy who just studies"
fi6596_RUNQ,Except doing homework is actually productive and helps your brain grow 😂🤣
fi6596_RUNQ,@Baha Yeşilyurt true but there are quite a few games you need to save
fi6596_RUNQ,you mean lego? or are you american im british
fi6596_RUNQ,Or making the LEGOs unusable because you corrupted them.
fi6596_RUNQ,"Or like if you are right in the middle of a book, and someone slams it shut and throws it across the room without allowing you to put in a bookmark or allow you to memorise which page you’re on"

fi6596_RUNQ,@Brooke Eberhard if I turn off my dad&#39;s TV when he is watching the football and he gets mad at me does that mean his frontal cortex is not developed enough
fi6596_RUNQ,@Baha Yeşilyurt they were about to get a victory royale
fi6596_RUNQ,"@Baha Yeşilyurt nobody was slapped in this video what are you on about? And there weren&#39;t much of any fits besides a few kids, and one who swore"
fi6596_RUNQ,"@Baha Yeşilyurt you don&#39;t know that at all, and even so they have the right to be angry. The parents are in the wrong"
fi6596_RUNQ,"Baha Yeşilyurt yes, but you must realize that those games require skill to win and what if you were about to win? I don’t think you’d like that to happen."
fi6596_RUNQ,"Ali A there’s a difference. Sitting in front  of a tv by watching mundane things doesn’t spark the brain to think unlike how games function, which do and there is a TED talk that illustrates the good effects"
fi6596_RUNQ,yeah bro sitting infront of a tv all day and then getting told to get off  then get mad doesnt sound like &quot;benefits&quot;
fi6596_RUNQ,James exactly. It just creates confusion to the general populace. The only solution to this would just be to believe what YOU think is right and that’s it

fi6596_RUNQ,"@Teasipper fair points 👍. <br><br>I would like to point out, this video is saying children&#39;s prefrontal cortex are not fully developed. The video strongly hints that this lack of development may be due to videogames. <br><br>Very few studies have been undertaken to show any connection such as this, and   children&#39;s minds are still developing at these ages in any case"

NNgp1_B-6c8,Welcome 🤗
NNgp1_B-6c8,Children follow by example :)
NNgp1_B-6c8,"He said “underprivileged” meaning poor and I must note that not all poor homes are necessarily bad ones! I stayed home with my daughter until she started kindergarten and I got A LOT of flack from people for being lazy and not “working”, but quite frankly, a job would have been A LOT easier! We struggled living on nothing but a $850 monthly social security check (her father died when she was a baby) and food stamps. However, like you said, I never trusted dropping her off with strangers when she was so young. So, I devoted all of my time to teaching her things and being the best mom I could be. And all the while, we were VERY underprivileged!!!"
NNgp1_B-6c8,Happy to hear that!
NNgp1_B-6c8,"Wealthy families are much more likely to have a stay at home parent and not have a parent working 2 jobs. They’re less likely to be stressed out, so they have a higher tolerance for their kid’s misbehavior."
NNgp1_B-6c8,BAD attitude
NNgp1_B-6c8,"I&#39;d say though the difference of time compared to when this research was conducted and todays world the theory is not as applicable. I am sure there is much more factors in play then that are represented. One example may be siblings, which was unmentioned on the study. Inevitably, either negative or positive, a factor such as the beforementioned must&#39;ve had a quite drastic affect on the children. I feel like more factors could&#39;ve been mentioned, drawn, or represented on either this research or this video as it may be quite misleading."
NNgp1_B-6c8,@Azure Nojito where parents can be bothered.<br>So it’s realistic however parents can’t be asked<br>On a whole.

NNgp1_B-6c8,Thanks for pointing this out.
NNgp1_B-6c8,Thanks for sharing
NNgp1_B-6c8,Yes I&#39;m not truly sure about the statistics used here
NNgp1_B-6c8,I didnt have any of that and came from a welfare family
NNgp1_B-6c8,"Like others said : it’s a study ; of course <b>they will always have exception</b> , it’s just that the majority seems to do that..."
NNgp1_B-6c8,"Totally agree, me and my kids are all avid readers with huge vocabularies and I get benefits. My dad&#39;s family were well off and abusive so I call bull."
NNgp1_B-6c8,"yes, but in poor countries food is the first priority and if that is not even satisfied how can they think of all these things?"
NNgp1_B-6c8,"Absolutelly, I was thinking exactly the same"
NNgp1_B-6c8,*raising*...
NNgp1_B-6c8,"Passive income, that&#39;s the key"
NNgp1_B-6c8,More money. More problems.

NNgp1_B-6c8,You know what also was really good for having children at home with a constant nurturer? Before governments forced women into the workforce. Back when a single salary could buy a big house and feed a whole family with ease. Now people just ask for more taxes and bigger government to fix a problem caused by taxes and bigger government.

C4iDbGy_8RE,"I have been treated bad by people because my child has autism. At the school they did not want him they fought with me for years by bullying me intimidating me sending false reports about my child so they can make me take my kid out of the school. N.B. the kid is a quiet and good kid not agressive. <br>They just did not want my child because the child has autism and they see it as problem for them so they did to us the most unkind horrible stuff. Psychological war, putting the kid in separate classroom or outside. People have done to me and him the most horrible stuff just because of autism. That was their excuse. Things i would have never imagined myself to do to anyone. I have met all of human cruelty because of my child s condition. I also entered a relationship with a person wouter van der g who i later realised only wanted to use me for free roof free food and to bring his dad to my country. And all this because his dad gerard van der g and grandma helen van sha were telling him i worth nothing because i give birth to autist kid. All these while i have found job to wouter gave him a place to live for free and cooked for him each day while i even cured an std he got cheating on me with a woman his dad gerard van der ga told him to sleep with. Also wouter van der ga has beaten me on several occasion when he wanted to go out with other women while living in my property becayse as his dad told him i worthed nothing because i have an autist child. When i took wouter to courts for his beatings and the damages to my property he has done, he put a girlfriend of his to call on social services on me on false accusations that my kid eats from the garbages. Imagine we are talking about wouter van der ga a guy who was eating each day at my house fresh food i cooked for him and he was seeing the food was fresh for him and my kid with my money. This van der ga family lived in middelburg until they came in my country on my expenses in my property. To add to this my family mother and father does not let me date anyone or have any friend. My mother never keeps my child while she keeps my sisters children."

C4iDbGy_8RE,"autism is autism, verbal or non-verbal, and your comment is discriminating against those who have learned to deal with society on a somewhat acceptable level. autism is a spectrum and every autistic person&#39;s struggles will vary. just because your kid doesn&#39;t speak it doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re more autistic than others. or, especially, that other people&#39;s autism isn&#39;t real. it&#39;s just the symptoms that might be more or less severe in some cases. please don&#39;t invalidate autistic experiences. also it&#39;s asperger&#39;s, not &quot;asbergers&quot; and it&#39;s not as commonly used anymore. asperger&#39;s syndrome is now called autism spectrum disorder, just like the &quot;real autism&quot; (don&#39;t use that term, please...) you&#39;re talking about"

C4iDbGy_8RE,"I had trouble focussing in school when I was in elementary school and it&#39;s hard. I was the student that didn&#39;t get anything and was always lost. I feel that I had to study double to understand something. Now that I look back, I noticed that I learned how to develop dedication which is a good trait you will probably develop. Don&#39;t feel bad, you probably have traits that other people don&#39;t have.

C4iDbGy_8RE,@karina castro Hello 👋 wonder if you can please reply back please.
C4iDbGy_8RE,you shouldnt have tested her so early. Read the book Late talking children a symptom or a stage? by stephen M. Camarata<br>he is a speech pathologist and professor and who knows what else and he states in his book that Millions of children get misdiagnosed. Sometimes its better to wait. Another thing to is dont believe everything a doctor says get different opinions from different specialists and dont give up until its a for sure thing that she is autisic. Advocate for your child. At the end of the day its only you who cares for her... they dont.
C4iDbGy_8RE,True but there are category of people who behave like they either grew up in barrel or are avoiding natural selection in nowaday comfy society.
C4iDbGy_8RE,"This is somewhat true in Europe, they put this stamp on you diagnosing you with something they don&#39;t have an awnser to as to what it is. It may not be easy to get but it&#39;s not that they know exactly what they are talking about since its not directly treadable,"
C4iDbGy_8RE,Hoki it’s actually not at all easy to get a diagnosis
C4iDbGy_8RE,"@Beaz Richz I did this for my child and found improvements. So, I actually consider it to be true :-)"

C4iDbGy_8RE,"My 3 year old daughter was diagnosed last year. They told me her score was mostly &quot;inflated&quot; because of her speech delay.  The whole subject makes me really wonder just how accurate it all is.    I really feel a lot of children are being labeled when they shouldn&#39;t be. Maybe is just me being in denial. We have her in hours of therapy each week and all, but it&#39;s hard to not wonder how she may have &quot;caught up&quot; without it."
C4iDbGy_8RE,Mlp p my boy on the waitlist for diagnosed too..... im so sad when his preschool teacher told me he got some sign of ASD... heartbreaking

C4iDbGy_8RE,"I am on the spectrum. I do not need to be fixed, I am not broken. I think in a different way, that’s all. If anyone doesn’t like me that’s on them."
C4iDbGy_8RE,"The idea behind this that there&#39;s a default neurological pattern in people&#39;s brains that gives rise to autistic symptoms and this hypothetical pattern is called autism. As far as I&#39;m concerned, this neurological pattern is yet to be proven for a fact and the symptoms could be caused by anything else. The more they research this, the more symptoms and people end up fitting the category. I&#39;m not an expert though, so I could be misunderstanding this completely (I hope not)."
C4iDbGy_8RE,"Don&#39;t give him tv to watch. My son is getting so much better after I stoped leting him watch tv. He has speach delay with few autism signs. Every doctor I spoke to said he can only watch 10 minitues of tv a day. Watching tv makes kids with attention deficit deeper in autism. He is 2 years old and now he is nor distracted so much, learns things faster, playes more, responds more. He was always social but even that got even more better. Also some children realy have a gut problem. I got my boy of the milk and gluten and was more fokused. Suger is also a problem with kids with attantion deficit and ADHD. Also fish oil is great for the brain, I seen some great things after giving it to him. There are lots of things that can become a problem for a child. We just have to find out the best solution for their problem. If it is autism early intervantion is the key. Floortime therepy is best for it."

C4iDbGy_8RE,"Speech delay and autism have some things related. Also ADD, ADHD and sensery issues could be the problem. My boy is like that, he is 2 years old and has speach delay. Everything has to be checked out to be shure. At evaluation they said he has receptice language at about 16 month (he was 23 months at the time) short attention spann, stuborn, tends to quit if the task is hard. So this is enough for him to have a huge speach delay. He is very social, loving, happy, outgoing, responds to his name and has very good eye contact. But speach deley is huge and he will start therapy soon."
C4iDbGy_8RE,"He could just have a speech delay. If your kid does certain motions that seem &quot;odd&quot; such as rocking, hand flapping, picking at his skin or pulling it gently, then he could be autistic. Talk to your guys&#39; family doctor about it and see what they think."

C4iDbGy_8RE,exactly dude !! <br>OR mild autism should be not confused with disciplined autism with different techniques to avoid meltdowns or spiralling in other exaggerated amplified symptoms.

C4iDbGy_8RE,It might be an adhd or trauma thing but idk
C4iDbGy_8RE,"Autism has nothing to do with intelligence, often autistic people have above average intelligence."
C4iDbGy_8RE,Actually no I have Aspergers and I have a lot of these symptoms.
C4iDbGy_8RE,"I have 2 autistic children an I have a lot of friends I made learning about everything over the years, and I can tell you way to many are not autistic it’s very unfortunate. It takes resources away from children in serious window periods. I have a friend right now her daughter does more then most children at 1 almost 2 but isn’t forming sentences as her sister in laws child is. Everyone has told her the nursery school well day care, the doctor everyone that the baby is developing wonderful. For Pete’s sake She can dress herself an is potty trained, says multiple words together, no stem just likes water an after 4 doctors they paid for they finally got their diagnosis, it’s become very alarming to me. My cousin did the same exact thing because her son didn’t like certain foods an would not go to bed without the tv on. Finally at age 12 they re evaluated the school demanded it because he was in special education classes that were not needed, they wanted to close his iep which I celebrated the day my older son went main stream I didn’t force him to stay in special Ed,  so she moved because of it. Well it just happened again the school now called in child services to evaluate the family. There is something very strange happening here where parents want this label am where people don’t seem to understand there are thousands of things that could go on, neurologically, lack of learning/structure/routine, physically or mentally add, bipolar, anxiety, there are so many but everyone wants “autism” I know not everyone there are many of us that cried ourselves to sleep over the diagnosis when severe, however it is very hard to see people that go above an beyond to have the diagnosis &amp; lie they need help to find out why they feel the way they do, and to understand the damage it does to take resources or to not have the right ones especially with the window period for so many.. my older son was re evaluated an he is not autistic not on the spectrum somehow but I was told for years he was.. now I’m dealing with it again an I personally think it is neurological with my daughter as she has serious vision issues an has seizures as a baby, unfortunately I’m waiting still for the neurologist appointment but they had no issue slapping on Asperger’s"

C4iDbGy_8RE,"ADHD can appear like depression in young girls.  My wife was treated for depression her whole teenage years and now it appears she was misdiagnosed and actually started taking a child&#39;s dose of generic adderall.  It&#39;s changed her life.  She&#39;s very focused and I&#39;ve seen her become very organized and all around happier.  Recently I had the symptoms of extreme depression.  I was lethargic and wouldn&#39;t leave the house.  I lost all interest in life.  I thought I had sleep issues because no matter how much I slept I was tired.  I avoided contact with lifelong friends because I just didn&#39;t have the energy.  A doctor found my vitamin D was extremely low.  Once on vitamin D my energy levels soared to normal.  I&#39;m happy and listen to music again.  So 2016 has been a strange year for my wife and I.  The problems we had were not caused by what we thought.  For you and your daughter I recommend seeking multiple opinions.  You never know who will have the golden ticket.  Doctors are extremely smart individuals; however, human biology and psychology is so complex.  Start back with a general practitioners.  They don&#39;t specialize in single problems but have a general understanding of the body and mind as a whole.  Good luck.  I hope you don&#39;t worry too much about your daughters future.  It sounds like she has a very caring mother."

C4iDbGy_8RE,"adam nan my 4 yr old has been diagnosed with autism. he didn&#39;t speak any words until he was 3. my son doesn&#39;t read, but he does recognize his name in written form. every child is different and as parents, we just have to keep working with them and trying different things to find a format or technique that works for our own child. I taught my son the sentence &quot;I want (insert want here) please&quot; and that helped tons when he wanted something instead of the meltdowns. being around other children has also helped tremendously for my son. he goes to an all special needs preschool school, which is totally funded by the district or state. I would recommend asking the principal of your elementary school what tests and services you can receive for your child. my son even has door to door service, which means that the bus literally picks and drops him off in front of our house. super convenient because his school is 30 mins away."

C4iDbGy_8RE,"When I was in my kindergarden i remember not javing friends till i was in the 1st grade no friends when i reached 2nd grade i dont know how but i had 2 friends when i was in 3rd grade both of them transfered school in 4th grade i didnt have friends hntil 6th grade i srateted màking friends in 8th grade i started joining clubs school activities and was able to show my interests in dancing now im in 11th gade soon to be 12th grader and im starting to social distancing physically and mentally, i was very shy but when i reached 8th grade i had confidence and then in 11th grade i trasnfered school and yeah it made me very shy because i thought i was not enough i cant do what they can i became very timid and aloof, i was scared to communicate to people, i became very sensitive, then sometimes very lazy or is it overly laid back, and yeah same i wasnt diagnised for anything thats why im here at youtube to learn i dint have money and in the place i live we dont have good psychologist and they are not even good so what am i supposed to do dang t"
C4iDbGy_8RE,"i&#39;m 23 and it&#39;s helped me tremendously. i got diagnosed with mild autism last week. since highschool is when i noticed i had a hard time socializing and understanding things around me... but i was &quot;normal enough&quot; that i could hide it and pretend my way through. from age 15 until now i had always thought i&#39;ve been depressed becasue i&#39;d get set off easily, becoming extremely upset or exhausted for no reason. i would get As in the assignments i&#39;d turn in, but couldn&#39;t handle the course load and would drop out of a lot of university classes. i didn&#39;t understand how i could understand the material i was being taught but it felt impossible organizing myself/ priorities.  i thought it was my fault that i couldn&#39;t keep up. i think if i had my &quot;label&quot; earlier i would have understood myself, my strengths, and limitations much earlier. i wou&#39;dn&#39;t have blamed myself as much. and i don&#39;t think i would have tried to commit suicide twice (close calls) when i was a teenager and two years ago because of how hopeless i felt for &quot;no reason&quot;. maybe YOU don&#39;t want labels. but they make me feel secure and can help people a lot"
C4iDbGy_8RE,"Mary Rowe exactly, i hate these labels"
C4iDbGy_8RE,@Mel B My daughters 4yo and only speaks some words like cookie water chocolate firetruck etc and points at stuff that she wants. Is that considered mild autism?
C4iDbGy_8RE,If she is non verbal that isn&#39;t mild.
C4iDbGy_8RE,are you sure its mild? if she is nonverbal then she has severe autism not mild
C4iDbGy_8RE,@Vince Locoratolo my kid is much improved. 
C4iDbGy_8RE,Christopher Adams let me know how you go as my son has just been diagnosed he is 3.5yo
C4iDbGy_8RE,@Cult Boy Of course she knows. But knowledge does not automatically imply finger coordination.
C4iDbGy_8RE,That&#39;s great you learned to tie your shoes. My 3 year old grandson was diagnosed with autism.  He has a problem speaking but slowly but surely he is learning.  Our entire family loves that little boy so much. I bet your family loves you also. You just keep learning and you will be fine. God Bless You.
C4iDbGy_8RE,My son is 9 and still learning to tie his shoes. This comment is so comforting ❤
C4iDbGy_8RE,If
C4iDbGy_8RE,Totally agree 100 percent!!
C4iDbGy_8RE,Pablo Dubbitz I believe this too always about money
C4iDbGy_8RE,"Haha, no. That&#39;s not what is happening. You have to meet certain criteria to get this diagnosis. It is actually quite hard to get an autism diagnosis, but even more so when it is mild. We spent two years with doctors and in therapies to finally arrive at mild autism and ADHD with our child. Girls are even harder to diagnose than boys. If anything, kids are under diagnosed because of how many girls get missed."

C4iDbGy_8RE,"Are you extroverted? Socially awkward doesn&#39;t necessarily mean you are introverted or having big difficulties making friends. The not understanding sarcasm and overuse of jokes could be your version of socially awkward. But, in the end, all that matters is if what you&#39;re doing is working for you!<br>It is possible to &quot;outgrow&quot; some symptoms. My daughter has mild autism and ADHD, and she has seemed to outgrow her echolalia, which was pretty severe when she was younger. Either that or she has gotten very good at working around it and we can&#39;t tell. She&#39;s very outgoing, so that has probably helped her get past some of those difficulties."
C4iDbGy_8RE,"I&#39;m the queen of sarcasm. LOL. Even at 7, I could make an adult cry. Or scream &amp; run from the room. My mother kept telling me, &quot;Don&#39;t do that.&quot; I&#39;d say, &quot;We were just talking.&quot; Which is true. but, hmm, it&#39;s difficult to understand why people get hysterical over stuff. I just don&#39;t get it. I probably never will. I notice even on the computer, people try to ruffle my feathers. Sorry, guys, no feathers."
C4iDbGy_8RE,Elias Chair how did you overcome thz disorder brother??? .. pls tell us . it wil help us

C4iDbGy_8RE,"@Bolin Hong autism can not be cured. You cannot say he has none of it anymore. You are born with it, it’s a neurological problem. There is no such thing as mild or severe. There is just autism. They mild and severe refers to the level of care they need. I think everyone needs more research and knowledge on this subject"

C4iDbGy_8RE,I was told I have Aspergers not mild Aspergers what is that?
C4iDbGy_8RE,"@***** oh i definitely have it. but what i meant was, not as extreme as people usually see in videos. <br>i&#39;m pretty normally functioning"
C4iDbGy_8RE,"That&#39;s absolutely the hardest thing for me to. Be sure not to push to hard, also take time and energy to be yourself, because that is most times when you function best."
C4iDbGy_8RE,Posey  Here we go again.....sigh........
C4iDbGy_8RE,Autism is a spectrum I teach a medium functioning autistic child at church. I’m praying he will be good for me tomorrow he usually is sometimes he wants to run out though I told him it makes me scared when you run away he’s a sweet heart though. I’m thinking of taking the kids on a nature walk tomorrow when we get finished with everything if it’s not raining I’m going to get someone to help me in Sunday school with the kids to help me keep them safe.
C4iDbGy_8RE,"Posey actually, there is a big difference, coming from someone on the low end of the spectrum."
C4iDbGy_8RE,Posey very good.
C4iDbGy_8RE,Yes there is severe is mute mild is like me Aspergers high functioning autism
C4iDbGy_8RE,Yaayyy
C4iDbGy_8RE,Because a lot of people have autism
C4iDbGy_8RE,Yes
C4iDbGy_8RE,I wish they wouldn&#39;t do that. There is different types of autism don&#39;t lump us all together
C4iDbGy_8RE,Yes it is.  I have high functioning autism.

C4iDbGy_8RE,"Not everyone with OCD is autistic but everyone whom is autistic has OCD. It&#39;s usually the first red flag noticed in determining if someone is on the spectrum.<br>Edit: I&#39;d like to point out that I along with my oldest son are on the spectrum as well. If you meet me and didn&#39;t know you wouldn&#39;t be able to tell (unless you personally know what to look for), but my son is level 3 (extreme) and it&#39;s noticeable. When he was only one year playing with his cars, he&#39;d line them up by colour first then by size."
C4iDbGy_8RE,@Malyssa C I mean.... Way to defend autism but.... I&#39;m on the spectrum but before that diagnosis I had OCD. Common?
C4iDbGy_8RE,"...when given a diagnosis the range of severity starts at mild, then severe, finally extreme... there&#39;s no such thing as a &quot;Severe, Mild diagnosis&quot; also next time you want to get attention from strangers make sure your lies are better structured since most of us with autism have severe to extreme O.C.D."
C4iDbGy_8RE,wetmurder b to llll
C4iDbGy_8RE,Best answer by far!!! It is a spectrum.

qMkTpZSk9uY,They won’t put everything but still some things. It’s how they learn. I would suggest reading more in depth child development content than this if you think your kid will really comprehend not to put things in their mouth at this age because expectations rob the joy of  watching thing grow and learn
qMkTpZSk9uY,Your child probably will lol
qMkTpZSk9uY,You should talk to the pediatrician.
qMkTpZSk9uY,"My child was born two months early and is already running at 14 months :D ... Said his first sentence at 12 months too and still says it, which is &quot;what&#39;s that?&quot; lol"
qMkTpZSk9uY,It says “with* or without help” and when they smile at 15 months it is more purposeful than at 3 months. Relax
qMkTpZSk9uY,True. My son is 14 months and can stand and pretty much do anything else but walk. He has no interest as of now really. Lazy like his old man haha. As long as they&#39;re physically active in other ways like crawling and pulling themselves up to stand then it&#39;s not a big deal until around 2

H_O1brYwdSY,Hello Kornelia 🙂. I didn&#39;t send anything to you. What are you referring to? Thanks.
H_O1brYwdSY,"Hi Eman. As @r.garnder mentioned, every child takes his/her own time to develop self-regulation. Honestly, lot of adults as well have trouble with self-regulation. So it does not mean that your child has ADHD. I would suggest that you meet with a Developmental Specialist if you need an accurate assessment. Thanks."
H_O1brYwdSY,Nope... No child is born with executive function. It’s something that’s developed over time with consistent structure.
H_O1brYwdSY,"Sorry, but would you mind translating your message in English? Thanks."

H_O1brYwdSY,@Kreative Leadership yes . It&#39;s fully about editing. How that hand animation movement is done in video starting ? Please explain . Thank you for your response ✌️
H_O1brYwdSY,Hello Sudharshan. I don&#39;t understand your question. Are you referring to the video editing? Would you elaborate?
H_O1brYwdSY,Hello Sudharshan. I don&#39;t understand your question. Are you referring to the video editing? Would you elaborate?
H_O1brYwdSY,I am glad you found the games useful Manish. Thanks for watching the video 👍🙂
H_O1brYwdSY,Thanks Jake. I am glad you found the video useful. I would love to hear some feedback after you try some of these games in your classes 🙂
H_O1brYwdSY,Hello John. This was one of the first videos I ever made and was a learning experience. I understand it can be frustrating to some when there is no voice over. I will try to ensure that I have minimal reading and more voice in future videos. Thanks for your constructive feedback. 🙂
H_O1brYwdSY,"I am glad you liked it Amreen. Good luck with the assignment, and do credit the video during your demo, if that&#39;s possible 🙂"

H_O1brYwdSY,This video is so good
H_O1brYwdSY,"Hi Amarilys. Just wondering if you tried the bubble idea, and did it work? 🙂 Thanks."
H_O1brYwdSY,Awesome! Would love to hear how it is received by your group. Thanks!
H_O1brYwdSY,Thanks Carolina. I will definitely check it out.
H_O1brYwdSY,It is so interesting i want to read it.!
H_O1brYwdSY,Tauri Nice I was thinking that but gave a pass because of the language barrier.
H_O1brYwdSY,"Tauri: I completely agree with you. We tend to use the terms interchangeably, but as you rightly mentioned, one needs self regulation to have self control. Thanks for watching the video."
H_O1brYwdSY,Thank you for sharing this video it is really useful
H_O1brYwdSY,Claudia Bothner I have a video about one tip you could try on my channel.  Look for Wednesday Wisdom episode 1.
H_O1brYwdSY,Hello Claudia. Let me do some research and revert to you.
H_O1brYwdSY,";) Thank you! So, let´s continue to do what we do best, which is raising wonderful and happy children! Love the concept of Kreative Leadership so I subscribed your channel. :)"
H_O1brYwdSY,"Thanks for your comment! As a parent of 2 kids, I&#39;ve often made the mistake of assuming that certain skills cannot be taught. But I now firmly believe that all life and social skills can be taught and in a fun way too. :-)<br><br><br>I would love to learn from you about techniques that you&#39;ve used to build some of these skills. I do request you to watch some of my other videos in my channel (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/c/KreativeLeadership)"">https://www.youtube.com/c/KreativeLeadership)</a> on early childhood development and provide me your thoughts.

fzfa8G9kFr4,ViawhatsApp
fzfa8G9kFr4,@Jesus Siqueiros right
fzfa8G9kFr4,😍   @cathy yang thanks for sharing valuable information
fzfa8G9kFr4,💀
fzfa8G9kFr4,What?
fzfa8G9kFr4,"I agree with this as I&#39;m an Early Childhood Eductor as well and my agreement is backed by theories and researches that we study in our course.Also, adding to this I had a healthy discussion with some of the prominent Educators about the steep FAD prodigy baby programs promoted and sold over the social media platforms  where the baby is said to achieve it&#39;s milestones way before an average.These kind of programs do more harm than good as they lay a lot of pressure on the growing baby&#39;s brain and physique and is totally against the developmentally appropriate practices."
fzfa8G9kFr4,😂😂😂😂😂
fzfa8G9kFr4,People always forgot about Moral
fzfa8G9kFr4,Exactly
fzfa8G9kFr4,Dankprincess <br>And Your Kid&#39;s are not my Problem.
fzfa8G9kFr4,Dankprincess <br>I am not a Brain Specialist but understands that a kid&#39;s brain is in it&#39;s developing stage until the age of 6 and then it starts to grasp and memorise things till the age of 60. <br>After the age of 60 it gradually stops to memorise. As you can see Senior Citizens aren&#39;t able to recognise people in those time.
fzfa8G9kFr4,@Ahmed Shaikh i mean the brain development is until age 25.. i wont have any kids or would i do this because i feel like kids need to be kids but gifted kids naturally want to learn.
fzfa8G9kFr4,Dankprincess <br>You try it with your kids and talk about it in the future.
fzfa8G9kFr4,Ahmed Shaikh actually its until age 25 but what ever
fzfa8G9kFr4,Ethan Reches ; ...and?
fzfa8G9kFr4,You don&#39;t need to be a dog to be trained. Everyone is trained by their environment. If you want children to be successful you have to make their environment a good learning experience
fzfa8G9kFr4,For every one child  That improves their memory and intellect 3 children develop neurosis and all kinds of  Anxiety disorders and inferiority complexes
fzfa8G9kFr4,Don&#39;t get jealous these kids are smart they won&#39;t be depressed or working in Walmart.
fzfa8G9kFr4,18 years left….
fzfa8G9kFr4,alcohol addiction
fzfa8G9kFr4,@just a feeling depends on how you look at it.
fzfa8G9kFr4,You can spend time with your kids and do these activities at home too.
fzfa8G9kFr4,I’m a 16 year old male. Who really wants kids to raise. The thought of raising kids is great
fzfa8G9kFr4,@Hilai Karim STRAIGHT FACTS! FREE THE BABY TO JUST BE AN INDIVIDUAL AND CARE TO THEIR NEEDS
fzfa8G9kFr4,Today education is a money making racket. Just  be active with ur kids feed them healthy food n put them to bed on time. Keep them away from all screens n have a pleasant loving atmosphere at home. They will grow well
fzfa8G9kFr4,@Hilai Karim oh well...Human like to be a robot...let them be 😂
fzfa8G9kFr4,"@Miles Madrigal my parents bought a tablet for my 6-year old sister and honestly it&#39;s gotten so bad. She barely eats, she never wants to take her showers and she hates learning. Anytime she doesn&#39;t understand something or can&#39;t do something she gives up immediately. She never passes any of her tests at school. I&#39;m honestly so worried about her. And whenever we do confiscate her electricities she sleeps all day. My parents have clearly made some grave mistakes raising her 😔... Basically what I am trying to say is you&#39;re digging your own grave if you think giving children technology is going to help them. It varies from kid to kid but in the end, they&#39;ll get addicted"
fzfa8G9kFr4,I agree.
fzfa8G9kFr4,Danielle Louis how about studying?
fzfa8G9kFr4,Hahahahahaha
fzfa8G9kFr4,"These classes are actually typically fun, specifically the sensory and movement ones! Little kids love these. It’s not like forcing the kids to study. These are actually activities that you can do at home and are often recommended by pediatricians and child psychologists."
fzfa8G9kFr4,Meth
fzfa8G9kFr4,Liem Nguyen that is partially correct
fzfa8G9kFr4,Educational experiences are a way of life. Everything you do to is an opportunity to learn and grow. These kids are lucky to be learning that.
fzfa8G9kFr4,I&#39;v been going to school since i was in my dads nuts sac..he was a teacher!😁
fzfa8G9kFr4,I just wanna be a baby
fzfa8G9kFr4,I went to school when I was 2 and a half years old
fzfa8G9kFr4,I went to school since I was three yes sadly😩. Dais when they teaching you how to read and write
fzfa8G9kFr4,"Yes, they smart to destroy their kids life. Especially chinese."
fzfa8G9kFr4,Space Boy ☺️ Aw!
fzfa8G9kFr4,Mild Potato what a smart potato
fzfa8G9kFr4,🤔🤔 idk but not all parents from Asian do that... i thought just a parents have lots of money and they want the baby is smart with a classearly...
fzfa8G9kFr4,🤣😂😂😂😂
fzfa8G9kFr4,"Correction. Nothing to do with Asian. This is Chinese style which always force their kids to the limits with hope their kids will get better job and the parents will get taste of wealth from his kids on day. Dont be confiused. Chinese only concern abt money, not baby."
fzfa8G9kFr4,Lol.
fzfa8G9kFr4,LOL
fzfa8G9kFr4,"As an Asian guy, I don&#39;t find that racist at all. More like a compliment."
fzfa8G9kFr4,"James Somogyi That&#39;s really funny, but that could be used as a joke, but not actually real."
fzfa8G9kFr4,@Respectthejibooty 95 As a matter of fact I just became 31 years old two months ago
fzfa8G9kFr4,"@AH How old are you, seven?"
fzfa8G9kFr4,@Respectthejibooty 95 ha...NOT good one
fzfa8G9kFr4,Then don&#39;t take him to class. Simple
fzfa8G9kFr4,What
fzfa8G9kFr4,I bet you think the earth is round
fzfa8G9kFr4,I bet you also think vaccine injuries have been debunked as well 🙄
fzfa8G9kFr4,"Yes, left/right brain theory is pop psychology. Learned that in my university courses. I don’t have a precise source but look into it."
fzfa8G9kFr4,Appreciate that if u could link ur claim to the literature...i m keen to find out more. Thanks.
fzfa8G9kFr4,Sources?
fzfa8G9kFr4,🤣🤣🤣😃🤣
fzfa8G9kFr4,😂😂😂😂😂
fzfa8G9kFr4,Bruh....if you smart then have depression everything is gone...how i know? Its happened to me....
fzfa8G9kFr4,Time for home schooling lol.
fzfa8G9kFr4,By the way the same ones saying he’s “disruptive” are the ones telling me how he excels academically. My diagnosis is he’s bored. He prefers a more interactive teaching method. All the kids are on their tablets they feel naked without them. BRING THE TABLETS InTO THE CLASSROOM. ITS 2019 FOR CRYING OUT LOUD. The do’s and fonts and the ins and outs of tech these days should be introduced into the school curriculum. Period.
fzfa8G9kFr4,😂🤣
fzfa8G9kFr4,Now I know how they are going to write OC Bible.
fzfa8G9kFr4,It happened to adults.  When we have problem we want to forget it but our brain deleted it but not delete the problem. 😂
fzfa8G9kFr4,"It’s not about remembering the things you learn, but developing your brain so you can learn more difficult stuff. Nobody expects a person to know how to do algebraic equations in their every day life, but learning how to do those equations enhances a person’s problem solving skills"
fzfa8G9kFr4,"Nothing to do with Asian. This is chinese parents style. Force their babies to learn quickly, get the amazing salary job and get rich from their kids wealth."
fzfa8G9kFr4,now ya know
fzfa8G9kFr4,"Hey, I am just getting them ready for the metaverse 😂!"
fzfa8G9kFr4,Thats right...
fzfa8G9kFr4,YES!
fzfa8G9kFr4,My toddler is doing multiple flashcards .. abcs and numbers ..soon problem solving.
fzfa8G9kFr4,Exactly! My daugther is only 8 months old but already knows what&#39;s  the used of pens . She would pick up the pen and scribble on her blackboard
fzfa8G9kFr4,😂😂😂
fzfa8G9kFr4,😭😂😂😂😂😂😂I love your comment so imma like this honestly
fzfa8G9kFr4,🤣🤣🤣
fzfa8G9kFr4,Or Dwight Schrute XD
fzfa8G9kFr4,Anyway I will go check out the Education of Carl Witte.
fzfa8G9kFr4,KT Food Stories most parents I personally know let their maids teach their child. That a bit not so right.
fzfa8G9kFr4,"@Beavis Yeah, I did that too when he was little"
fzfa8G9kFr4,"KT Food Stories I do use online video flashcards which is only about 5 minutes a day. Other than that, I DO NOT let my daughter play with the iPad, TV or any devices."
fzfa8G9kFr4,"@Beavis Sure. Last but not least : No phone, Tablet, or TV."
fzfa8G9kFr4,Wow!
fzfa8G9kFr4,Che Erin I started reading at 33 months but anyway
fzfa8G9kFr4,Che Erin Thanking  you  boy
fzfa8G9kFr4,MrSavagePickles lol
fzfa8G9kFr4,"Nope ...the baby can support it&#39;s own weight...their grip is strong, it&#39;s instinctive!"
fzfa8G9kFr4,@Marina E OK Karen. Your question didn&#39;t make sense to begin with. Perhaps you should have done flash cards when you were a child.
fzfa8G9kFr4,"@Tupher You don&#39;t actually answer any of my questions, instead you make a lot of assumptions and are throwing in some insults.<br>No point discussing with you."
fzfa8G9kFr4,"@Tupher Could you please define &quot;successful&quot;? And why do you think Asians (everyone living in Asia? Or everyone being a national of an Asian country?) are more successful than people from other continents?<br>And what exactly could my child learn from flashcards, that it can&#39;t learn without them - in a way that is more suitable for their age and the way their brains work?"
fzfa8G9kFr4,Thats why Asians are among some of the most successful. Your child could learn a thing or two if you weren&#39;t so closed minded.
fzfa8G9kFr4,Lol ayfs this looks lit
fzfa8G9kFr4,That&#39;s what i say too
fzfa8G9kFr4,"They are growing up in peace. Stimulation is good for babies. In fact, they NEED stimulation. Those babies are all definitely having more fun and are better off than parents who leave their babies alone to just cry."
fzfa8G9kFr4,They want to build a robot
fzfa8G9kFr4,then more time to be creative.
fzfa8G9kFr4,yeah
fzfa8G9kFr4,"There is, that&#39;s crazy! The program my daughter was in when she was 3 yrs old, offers something like this but for expecting mothers."
fzfa8G9kFr4,"I started from when my child was in the womb, i would read to him and sing to him on his first days out in this world and my son is two now. Very smart. Knows all his letters numbers and shapes... SPANISH AND ENGLISH! And of course he loves it, i never forced him. And i always made it fun for him. We turn it into a game. He learns playing (:"
fzfa8G9kFr4,I am sure they are coming up with how to train the baby in the womb and finding new ways of how the baby should exit the womb 😅😅😅
fzfa8G9kFr4,@Bunny The Voyager nope. It&#39;s a popularised myth
fzfa8G9kFr4,if i remember my child hold is lot stupid than nowadays child
fzfa8G9kFr4,Is this really teaching kids to develop their brain of to memorize flash cards
fzfa8G9kFr4,@Beavis Theyre popular because people think they work. Just lime fad diets and subscription boxes
fzfa8G9kFr4,@Samuel Lee I am doing Montessori and there are no flashcards in it. She can do very nice things
fzfa8G9kFr4,"the dichotomy between the left brain and right brain function have been disputed. when your brain is activated while doing tasks, the whole brain is activated. it’s globally activated. so idk his claim about training right brain, to me sounds like pseudoscience. but hey to each his own, if you feel that doing all of these things help your child then by all means. I would send my child too to one of these centres but not to train their right brain but maybe just for the exposure to social interaction that will help my imaginary child as well. im not saying these centres are not beneficial, im just saying some of these claims made by them can be pseudoscientific. nevertheless, would your child benefit in some form or another by attending these classes? maybe. should u send them to these classes and how much? moderately and not schedule each and every minute of the child’s day with classes such as these. not unless the child has some learning impairment and need extra training etc occupational therapy, speech therapy as such then it’s a different story. so i do agree with some of these comments once a week is enough. other than that, interact with your child, (there has been evidence that your child’s vocab capabilities are enhanced when u talk to them constantly and not baby talk) and play with your child as u normally would and not just shove them in front of an ipad of course."
fzfa8G9kFr4,@Julie At Home hahaha literally the same as me!
fzfa8G9kFr4,And be a robot
fzfa8G9kFr4,But few smart people dont were glasses i&#39;m dumb and i were glasses🙂
fzfa8G9kFr4,Not necessarily....
fzfa8G9kFr4,"first last who made them? Who cares! It’s who invented them that matters. It doesn’t matter who makes them, you can train anyone to assemble something once the actual work of creating and inventions has been done. Maybe look into who invented all that stuff you mentioned."
fzfa8G9kFr4,@Elise Algaron hahaha i agree. Grown up with adults around me make older than my age. Now i dont have same age friends becaus they are think im like older people 😂
fzfa8G9kFr4,Agree. this is for people who have alot of money and spend on this.
fzfa8G9kFr4,Yes... my children are reading at 2yr and 3yr. My 3yr has fluency. My 2yr is almost fluent. My 1yr is learning to put the letter sounds together to create the words. We have to set aside time to teach our children and not expect the experts or strangers to do it all for us!
fzfa8G9kFr4,Yes... Just talk to your baby &amp; treat them like they’re an adult; just in a smaller less developed body with a brain that still is developing... People always want to speak “goo goo ga ga” to their infants but speaking to them regularly will do so much more for them... They may not understand but they are listening.
fzfa8G9kFr4,Mi__ly G I agree with u.
fzfa8G9kFr4,S KN never shake a baby
fzfa8G9kFr4,S KN right it can kill the baby hello
fzfa8G9kFr4,Taking &quot;Shook&quot; to a whole new level...
fzfa8G9kFr4,@Clarka Kento i agree ! Im not even asian but all that nonsense about Asians lacking creativity is getting old and reeks of insecurity.
fzfa8G9kFr4,Lol Asians caught up aldready
fzfa8G9kFr4,Westerners arent &#39;creative&#39; their just powerful because of their historically brawling ways.
fzfa8G9kFr4,"@Dominique Yeah he also had autism. Thats also why I like him, he&#39;s a lot like me (not saying im smarter or better than him). He is what I&#39;d call a dumb genius - people could think he&#39;s dumb because of his erratic and childish behavior, but he also had a love for physics (what autistics would call special interest) and dedicated his life to it. In my opinion, dedication is stronger than wits or memory. Of course, if you have low IQ and can&#39;t remember anything, then your achievements won&#39;t get you a worldwide prize, but still if you dedicate your life to one thing, you can achieve great things, be it a famous physicist, great architect or a tortured painter like Van Gogh"
fzfa8G9kFr4,"@Dominique Exactly...we just need to remember enough...<br><br>if we have no memory then we cant be smart either...<br>but, good memorization doesnt mean smart"
fzfa8G9kFr4,"No. Einstein,  in the Western world was considered a genius but one of his flaws was that he couldn&#39;t remember. So, no memory doesn&#39;t equal smarts, but it can maybe be useful in other ways."
fzfa8G9kFr4,@Jiro Conwi No it doesnt
fzfa8G9kFr4,Well we just need to stop put eveything in our phones and write on book or start to training our brain by remember without a phone.
fzfa8G9kFr4,Yes
fzfa8G9kFr4,@Phdiva 0890 They are far from stupid....Alhamdulillah...that&#39;s your opnion.
fzfa8G9kFr4,Its common sense. You dont need no so called &quot;expert at a university &quot; to tell you that if you talk to your baby and interact with them their brain will develop. Babies learn fast.
fzfa8G9kFr4,Let kids be kids they learn all there lifes once they start attending school. This is too much...seriously.
fzfa8G9kFr4,Fid LaF Thanks for sharing. Looks interesting!
fzfa8G9kFr4,"watvid1 , that cracked me up. Sad but true"

I have three children and they got tossed up and down like that also , how did that happen? Was the sitter tossing too hard or just jerked his neck at some point? Or was it something with the brain? I couldn&#39;t imagine something like that happening, I really hope your sister is doing okay. That would be such a tragic experience. I hope you and the rest of the family are doing okay also, I&#39;m really sorry. 💖"

My grandfather is a multi talent because he enjoyed the skill don&#39;t think its a stress full it is a skill where you learn with fun and interaction. let me give you a case when British invaded india there is a skill where an entire Saree can be folded and kept in a small match box .The britishers broked the arms of weavers and removed their hands so the skill is last these are traditions that were lost .So there is a skill near Turkey there people used to weave cloths from salt the skill is lost the kid in this video is being trained from young age its a skill ..even you and me can do it if we start young
fzfa8G9kFr4,@Christian D yep. And initiate yourself to read. Reading changes a lots of thing! Reading helps you for better of you in a future!
fzfa8G9kFr4,"You should think that this school build in a recent years, plus this class probably came up recently."
fzfa8G9kFr4,Lol
fzfa8G9kFr4,I know right
fzfa8G9kFr4,Yeon Arina it means afraid of losing
fzfa8G9kFr4,QUICK MAFS  what is Kiasu? Heard the term but never know the meaning.
fzfa8G9kFr4,QUICK MAFS lmao
fzfa8G9kFr4,(snicker)
fzfa8G9kFr4,To be fair all the kids I know who are becoming doctors or biochemical engineers started learning academies at super young ages (like 2-3 years old)
fzfa8G9kFr4,"Both are accepted <br><a href=""https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/usage/learnt-vs-learned"">https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/usage/learnt-vs-learned</a>"
fzfa8G9kFr4,"Gianna Kitty yes. Well english isn’t my first language and I remember my british teacher say that in her country along with Australia and some other countries, people say « learnt » but I was bound to see learned more often cause American media is everywhere. I need to check though"
fzfa8G9kFr4,Gianna Kitty i’m pretty sure british people say learnt instead of learned
fzfa8G9kFr4,And we still turn out ok
fzfa8G9kFr4,It still beneficial though especially those with subtitle will assist in learning language and spelling especially at young age.
fzfa8G9kFr4,😂😂😂
fzfa8G9kFr4,Lol
fzfa8G9kFr4,I was playing in dirt and testing its various flavors in a rural village.
fzfa8G9kFr4,they all are humans😄
fzfa8G9kFr4,lokansonlok ah okay but i as with other singapore chinese. Are proud chinese men and women. And would not like to be called anything other than that
fzfa8G9kFr4,"Go Away yea but when people say chinese, everyone just assume china. That&#39;s why I feel like it&#39;s rude to just say &quot;Chinese&quot;"
fzfa8G9kFr4,lokansonlok its not rude at all just dont say that we are china
fzfa8G9kFr4,"Go Away when have i said that lol I just feel like saying Singaporean are Chinese is a little disrespectful. Just like you don&#39;t call Canadian and Americans the same thing. But idk, you&#39;re the Singaporean, you can be offended."
2VkNWLYD5c4,kenneth taylor riches Care to elaborate on WTF you’re talking about?
2VkNWLYD5c4,"Lol key words. My phone,  Microwave radiation,  Known to cause tumors in rats,  your as smart as your  smartphone!!"
2VkNWLYD5c4,And your not now?
2VkNWLYD5c4,It can if you&#39;re not putting garbage on it and use it for one part of their learning  its working great for my family
2VkNWLYD5c4,Right
2VkNWLYD5c4,Right I&#39;m not  Saying you shouldn&#39;t limit the technology  and  time on it but my  Daughter knows her ABC&#39;s colors and can count to 30 on her own shall be 2 years old in 2 months she gets about 2 maybe 3 hrs a day it&#39;s her school fun tablet and works great!
2VkNWLYD5c4,@Anthony Cameron No.. tablets are always bad At babies ages from 0-3 years old baby. They can cause a myopia
2VkNWLYD5c4,Quite right tablet.s are good for the kids but has too be limited time about a 1 hour 1/2 is plenty
2VkNWLYD5c4,Lol but some how richer than all the people like you? Weird look it up more often than not a  Millionaire is made in this generation than previous ones I&#39;ll have to say you&#39;re wrong about that
2VkNWLYD5c4,kenneth taylor riches <br>I should’ve been more clear: children shouldn’t use technologies the first few years and after that they should be limited for the next few years. Then they can use more. <br><br>But every single doctor and pediatrician association on the planet gives a clear report and evidence how small children using technology and screen time actually have their brains rewired in negative ways. There is a whole host of negative medical repercussions. I encourage you to go online and read this data as it’s overwhelming.
2VkNWLYD5c4,But you... can use one??  Man I think you need help. the whole world is not got Everything right. AND  Neither do you  It will be 25 to 50 years before we know for sure. I hope you&#39;re wrong
2VkNWLYD5c4,"TV - parents would not allow kids to be too close to a television.<br><br>Ipad/Smartphones - kids are always too close to a TV.<br><br>Playing offline is important to develop a sense of direction, balance and space. It is also needed in order to have healthy bones, lungs and muscles. Plus, it&#39;s really very healthy to your eyes to focus on things that are a bit far from you. Facing something too close (also,  Ipads and  smartphones are lamps) can cause dangerous problems to your vision. <br><br><br><br>So, it&#39;s really not the same."
2VkNWLYD5c4,"Yeah but all those things are different. A baby uses a ipad like 8 hours a day, that shit is wack."
2VkNWLYD5c4,Technology already fixed this problem. Your concern is nearly 5 years late. The problem today is awareness and the ability to do such a simple thing. USE GOOGLE (responsibly of course).
2VkNWLYD5c4,Talented Toy Reviews the cons outweigh the pros
2VkNWLYD5c4,But those don’t happen. Dismantle an iPad. IT HAS NO EFFECTS ON YOUR EYES. all it can do is make you a bit drowsy. This is fake news boomer.
2VkNWLYD5c4,Ok.  But  y?
2VkNWLYD5c4,It&#39;s all about the way you use it..<br>So my daughter is  almost 2years old and knows  Shapes colors and can count to 30 and all the ABC&#39;s and can&#39;t stop singing the ABC  song. But its only  one part of her school fun time.
2VkNWLYD5c4,Lol
2VkNWLYD5c4,"Liz Preston exactly! Why are they not the same ages especially when every week in early development milestones form! Research has become so flawed. Just another study to push the agenda to say devices are good for kids, but they don’t mention they cause tumors and cancers in rats."
2VkNWLYD5c4,I thought so too!! The samples are not the same.
2VkNWLYD5c4,"Thank you very much, that was very interesting"
2VkNWLYD5c4,"Ihold8stars  I don’t think you  read my comments because I mentioned that tech should be introduced in grade school and that tech toddlers are still capable of becoming functional citizens in this country. Although I am totally against going COMPLETELY tech because there is something wonderful about sitting with my toddlers and turning the pages while reading a book. I personally have NOT yet met a toddler that knows how to use a debit card but that’s just me. 🤷🏻‍♀️ I don’t know where you live    but there is such a thing as TOO much. There has to be a balance of knowledge and exposure. 🤔 Also how would those kids, whom been in tech school most of their lives, transition to no tech at all if there was weather or technical  issues? I see your pros but we have to be realistic about the cons as well."
2VkNWLYD5c4,"This is odd and just as My observation... it is just a singular opinion. <br><br>Many charter and private schools and even some public schools have already gone  totally electronic... no books.. no paper. As well schools themselves have been testing students on electronics for years... Look at Khan academy for example or K12 online.. IXL.. Time4learning..<br>I to observe children... What I see... Tech kids have better social skills. Tech kids are not afraid to Express themselves. They are not afraid period. Tech kids are the ones who easily transition between tasks. Play memory with a tech and a non tech child... see sho wins. Non tech kids are easily bored. From my experience tech kids are substantially more clingy, needy. Tech kids are more open to challenges. They do not give up as fast as non tech kids seem to. Tech kids seem to understand emotions and have a better understanding of the world around them.<br>So Imo parents whom do not allow children electronics are directly preventing their childs growth.<br><br> Technology is the way of our world.. you may not like it but its fact.<br> Technology has been and will continue moving into every career.  McDonalds workers rely on electronics from taking your order to preparation...  Your mechanic relies on electronics for diagnostics... heck even today&#39;s farmers rely on technology. <br><br>Paper money is nearly obsolete.  Most toddlers today are capable of swiping a card and putting in the pin after helping mom ring up groceries at the self checkout register."
2VkNWLYD5c4,"It could be correlation not causation. It could be toddlers who have access to tablets have parents who use the tablets as babysitters instead of interacting with their children, which could explain their lack of further development."
2VkNWLYD5c4,"@Bubbles Not just any phone, an iPhone with service."
2VkNWLYD5c4,"@Nadia Martinez I agree! My aunt is mad because my little cousin doesn&#39;t like the bday gift she got her, because she prefers an actual phone to FaceTime and YouTube and she just turned 2 this month. She used to like books, but I think she prefers the tablet/phone more now. She ALWAYS wants the phone"
2VkNWLYD5c4,i guess I am kind of off topic but do anyone know of a good website to stream new series online ?
2VkNWLYD5c4,I really can&#39;t stand when I see parents give there babies tablets. They&#39;ll ruin there eyes at age 5...
2VkNWLYD5c4,Thank you for this post
2VkNWLYD5c4,building towers seems like a very 3D-based skill. it requires both perception and control in all 3 dimensions.
2VkNWLYD5c4,Their brains are being fried by microwave radiation. No joke.
2VkNWLYD5c4,@r greer watch the social dilemma on netflix
2VkNWLYD5c4,Why dont they?
2VkNWLYD5c4,"Jonathan Lin <br><br>The framing of the video is terrible as well. It talks about negative effects as a given but questions whether there are <b>any</b> positive effects. As with anything, it’s a bit of both. Technology is completely agnostic to what you want it to be. <br><br>My EdD advisors are leading experts on educational technology and are always emphasizing the fact that technology is never inherently good nor bad. It’s like asking if a hammer is inherently good or bad. It can be very useful/“good” when used constructively, but it can be very destructive/“bad” when used maliciously or irresponsibly."
2VkNWLYD5c4,"@OriginalRipndip I think she said that with TV watching it is all &quot;one-sided&quot; and the child does nothing, but with the computer, the child has to &quot;do&quot; in order for it to respond."
2VkNWLYD5c4,@Loz Turner didn&#39;t understand that
2VkNWLYD5c4,"That&#39;s not accurate,  generation  Y millennial&#39;s,  and the lasting generations of baby boomers 70s and 80s Were told that  about TV.  claims that it would make your eyes  square.  actually with TV there isn&#39;t an interactive component engaging with  the user ( unless you include the red button). TV  watching research shows that there is an underactive area of the brain when watching TV versus reading, socialising or anything else. Computers are inherent in stimulating the same sort of interactive stimulus that toddlers have benefited from across previous generations for hundreds of years. its just now that  neural growth is more innate and more insular or internal, doesn&#39;t necessarily  require a social interactions to occur."
2VkNWLYD5c4,"peterjg # exactly,  wait till they get older and start going to school , you&#39;ll see their studying abilities,  disturbed and social skills messed up."
2VkNWLYD5c4,"I did notice that, and it&#39;s quite interesting.  That&#39;s probably why they had easier control of the physical crayon as well, as it&#39;s easier than learning to control grip at that age. There were a lot of variables in this experiment though, honestly I was quite disappointed."
2VkNWLYD5c4,Word!
2VkNWLYD5c4,"Where&#39;s your data to support that claim. And no, tech users are NOT easily copy and paste. Creativity is part of the larger experiments. Dig deeper for knowledge my friend. The answers are usually much easier to find when you are aware of your ability to search for them."
2VkNWLYD5c4,Why?
2VkNWLYD5c4,...but a tech parent
2VkNWLYD5c4,Scientific Humanist Yes  🙌🏼
2VkNWLYD5c4,You have the right idea. Tablets are good depending on how u use them.
2VkNWLYD5c4,I noticed the same with my 19 month old
2VkNWLYD5c4,"Allie Fu + <a href=""https://youtu.be/oegnfAAkr_8"">https://youtu.be/oegnfAAkr_8</a>"
2VkNWLYD5c4,"Fid LaF what you are doing is advancing your children’s progress over their peers, not making little geniuses.."
2VkNWLYD5c4,@andarted Exactly!
2VkNWLYD5c4,They surely won&#39;t practice their empathy skills from some simple tablet games. That&#39;s still the responsibility of the parents.<br><br>Imho such tablet games are just a tool to help parents to educate their kids more effizient. Just like a playground is a tool for parents to support the development of some important skills to their children. The responsibility still lies by the parents. They have to choose what kind of skills they want to support.
2VkNWLYD5c4,"Moo Moo intelligence is such a broad term and consists of at least 8 sub groups. The tech babies were intellectually smarter in the fine motor skills portion of the experiment. So technique they did test intelligence, just not all types."
2VkNWLYD5c4,@Laurence Bois 😂😂😂😂😂
2VkNWLYD5c4,"It appears the BBC is siding with tech here. They might have done those tests and &quot;dismissed&quot; them.<br>My nephew is six and he was raised by tablets and phones, his motor skills are great but he has very poor social skills and a limited vocabulary. Basically I&#39;ve never heard him say &quot;mum&quot; or &quot;dad&quot; to his parents, his only common words are; Netflix, YouTube, 20th Century Fox and the pre-tantrum  &quot;phone dead&quot;."
2VkNWLYD5c4,"not really, TV requires 0 input and thought. At least on tablets, they&#39;re still playing games. It is pretty lazy parenting though."
2VkNWLYD5c4,"Yeah, I got a phone was I was 11 which I still wish I hadn’t so the idea of babies getting them is scary"
2VkNWLYD5c4,Same here!
2VkNWLYD5c4,Weihong Li Inagree but then again giving a child a tablet to a kid isn&#39;t raising kids.
2VkNWLYD5c4,Weihong Li I agree.  A tablet is a little big. An iPhone X would probably be better for their young wrists.
2VkNWLYD5c4,@john smith I agree.
2VkNWLYD5c4,Completelly agree!
2VkNWLYD5c4,"Really depends on the kind of game the child is allowed to play. Some train for better concentration, others don&#39;t. The same applies to the dopamine bursts and chance of addiction.<br><br>It&#39;s not the iPad that&#39;s the problem. What kind of games and in what proportion should be the focus of investigation here. <br> Although a baby may learn a lot from an iPad, it should never replace real life play and exploration. It&#39;s good to have a healthy proportion of both."
2VkNWLYD5c4,ditto
2VkNWLYD5c4,Well isn&#39;t tablets and cellphones are the reason why nixon declared a war on drugs at that time and adhd was invented by advertising company in the 90s. Yeah we should get rid of this technology and go back to 80s and 70s
2VkNWLYD5c4,Completely agree.
2VkNWLYD5c4,This video is just an example the kind of research that Dr.Smith is doing.
2VkNWLYD5c4,We probably won&#39;t fully know the effects of heavy usage till 20 years later
2VkNWLYD5c4,"I had the same thought, but they do address it at the end of the clip and say even though the sample size is small it does track with his previous research."
2VkNWLYD5c4,thank you for saving my time
2VkNWLYD5c4,I’m only 2 minutes in and I realised this is not going to reveal anything.
2VkNWLYD5c4,true
2VkNWLYD5c4,😂😂
2VkNWLYD5c4,"@once upon a death no, I like a report to present a sufficient amount of data so that I could even form a conclusion. This does not. Nor does it provide a source of the study that would indicate an actual sample size. If I told you that iPhones tend to explode and show you 5 iPhones, 4 of which do, how well informed is your opinion about the state of iPhones?"
2VkNWLYD5c4,Exactly
2VkNWLYD5c4,Also social skills and emotional development would be interesting.
2VkNWLYD5c4,"The cognitive side is coordination in itself we are so lacking in understanding across the board for you psychology and other science disciplines to work our way through rather than. going to the root School of science neurology,  deep neural networks at present (AI, and we consumers ,mostly know it by) already understand the linkages of regrowth and sending signals to one another for a much greater deeper output or understanding (however you want to word it).  the human brain works exactly the same way there is a total relevant argument here. about balance however previous generations versus new generations about how to divvy up the time for the toddler to spend on. a variety of activities to ensure the fora of growth stimulus across the brain&#39;s development.  obviously Freud&#39;s paradigms of. genetics environment and personality come. into play also other dispositions like personal preference intrinsic motivation and whether they actually like the activity in front of them which would only really become more of an issue as that. development of personality becomes more infinite in the individual after toddlers age"
2VkNWLYD5c4,"hey guys! it really is interesting to look at the effects on the mental capabilities of the babies. Another side to look at, too, is how is affects the psychology of the children. It might be that the tech babies are more confident since they are used to winning or succeeding in their games, maybe the non-tech babies are better at dealing with people etc. what do you think guys?"
2VkNWLYD5c4,For me as a parent I have to becareful and balance this.  I want my child to be technologically advanced but still be interested in reading a book or playing out side.  A book would seem boring compared to a tablet where the characters come to life.

vQRh_VMA7Vc,"normal child behaviour... is a child running about, a child playing with her stuff in a normal way, instead of throwing it through the room or swapping toys every 3 seconds, a child being able to actually focus on simple taskes (put your shoes away, clean up your room), a child being able to sit still for longer than 3 minutes those are normal children. Having ADHD is NOT that, my child has ADHD, My child can NOT sit still, my Child does not play with other children as other children don&#39;t like her because she is too rough and too loud, my child can not focus on simple tasks and can not finish these tasks, my child is being limited in her development due to her ADHD, My child has extreme Anger outbursts, not the typical screaming and crying because she doesn&#39;t get something she wants but the real outbursts where she screams as if you&#39;re killing her, where she starts hitting you, scratching you, biting you, kicking you and no my child is not a badly raised child.

vQRh_VMA7Vc,"⬆️⬆️⬆️⬆️ look up and hit him up helped me out with my anxiety, depression and adhd"
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"you can be either hyperactive, in attentive or both. thats the spectrum of adhd. some people with adhd prefer to call themselves someone with add because they are on the inattentive side of the spectrum"
vQRh_VMA7Vc,i&#39;d recommend you talk to your parents and go to a doctor and look into getting an adhd assesment :)
vQRh_VMA7Vc,alicia murch same
vQRh_VMA7Vc,maybe not everyone with adhd but i certainly do and i can barely read anything longer than a paragraph because i cant focus and my brain get overwhelmed
vQRh_VMA7Vc,there is still CBT. :) which you can start at any age
vQRh_VMA7Vc,@Exuveum same🤦🏻‍♀️
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Shit it&#39;s ended.
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Wait i didn&#39;t realize it was playing
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Ya it&#39;s actually a curse
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"nah, lofi hip hop makes me too focused on the music instead of whaf i&#39;m supposed to do"
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Zack Anthony I think I have adhd....
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Yea lol but not 15 minutes prolly less
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"sometimes someone will be talking to me and i start walking around in circles and humming to myself and not stopping until their done, same with when i&#39;m trying to sleep, i get out of my bed and start walking around and touching things in my bedroom until i get tired and my eyes get itchy-"
vQRh_VMA7Vc,i relate to this SO MUCH
vQRh_VMA7Vc,That&#39;s My life too smh
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"I&#39;m not a 100% percent sure I have adhd, but I think I have hyperactivity adhd. I do pretty much all of the 9 symptoms you need to have to have it, I&#39;m fairly positive I have it but my parents don&#39;t think so. I just hope I don&#39;t have it."
vQRh_VMA7Vc,This is a complete mood. Like the whole thing.
vQRh_VMA7Vc,i feel the same way! i think i have it but i&#39;m too scared to say anything to my dad
vQRh_VMA7Vc,@TheDudeXD at what point did I mention that. I recommend that you don’t jump to conclusions.
vQRh_VMA7Vc,@poke predator07 Just because you&#39;re distracted or whatever does not mean that you have ADHD
vQRh_VMA7Vc,I think I might have it but HOLY FUCK IS THIS BORING I&#39;VE ZONED OUT READING COMMENTS LIKE 6 TIMES PLS.
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Lmao. I’m entertaining the possibility that it’s possible I have adhd so this is kinda interesting to me also.
vQRh_VMA7Vc,wow that&#39;s an early diagnosis. how did they know?
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"oh, I relate to this so much. Actually, I went through this and both my parents told me that I don&#39;t actually have it and I&#39;m just imagining things, that I&#39;m perfectly fine. But I have so many symptoms, and went through the same experiences that diagnosed people have, so I just insisted that they take me to a doctor, and I made sure to have a serious conversation with them. I would say that you should sit down with your mother and honestly talk about your experiences and also the symptoms you share, as well as like let her know that if you don&#39;t find out now you might regret it for so long and it&#39;ll be stuck on your mind for so long, and isn&#39;t it better to just see if you have it or not? Oof sorry for rambling lol"
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"I have symptoms too, it’s so annoying, I see one birdie look at it for a few minutes and boom the lesson is done"
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"I know a lot of us do have “tics”, though it seems like they’re more classified as their own issue but they do go hand in hand."
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Damn this is too reliable-
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Do you have a sourc?
vQRh_VMA7Vc,How can you say brain chemical imbalances have never been proved and then give evidence that shows it’s real
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Ok so there may be something wrong with me-
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Which medical school did you attend? Facebook?
vQRh_VMA7Vc,ive had anxiety too
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Damn. thats tuff.
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"I have had ADHD since I was born I have gotten bullied for 7 years and I&#39;m only <b>10</b> I hope you get the treatment you deserve! adding to ADHD I was abandoned by my mom and dad I had been in 10 different foster families by 7 months  <i>may</i> have been sexually assaulted when I was little, had depression, anxiety, abandonment issues, social anxiety and so many more so I hope your journey is way better than mine:) I am not asking for pity I am just asking for you to tell someone! So you can get better early on!"
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Yep
vQRh_VMA7Vc,@lpsglossier yea I have that aswell
vQRh_VMA7Vc,I&#39;m literally doing it right now and i haven&#39;t played attention to half the video
vQRh_VMA7Vc,💀 literally doing that rn ...
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"@lpsglossier Did you ask them? It might be your personality too, there are so many of people like that it&#39;s pretty common I think! And so."
vQRh_VMA7Vc,I have had both since I was born :)
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"Yes, It is quite a common symptom. I have ADHD and I constantly pace around the room."
vQRh_VMA7Vc,God bless you 💞
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"I liked how you write, thank you for sharing this . Can you write personal vlogs ?! You are good at this"
vQRh_VMA7Vc,That doesn&#39;t mean that you have ADHD
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"Lol same, that is how I can’t tell if I’ve forgotten to take my meds"
vQRh_VMA7Vc,when I’m doing hw I just end up staring at the wall for like an hour
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Same
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"I dont think thats adhd. I think that just called undisciplined. I have autism, not the same as adhd but its a mental disorder that affects behaviour aswell. And even though my parents knew somehting wasnt right with me, they never let me off the hook for bad behaviour. Even now, at 14, if i say somethjng socially inappropriate (because autism), or offend someone without realising, ill ask for the appropriate punishment.<br><br>Just because i have a reason for my behaviour, i dont have an excuse. I think alot of the time people forget that."
vQRh_VMA7Vc,SEE i struggle w cutting down on the details and making things short and quick 💀💀 thanks a lot adhd
vQRh_VMA7Vc,holy shit that was long lmfao
vQRh_VMA7Vc,i was writing down my symptoms in a notes app and i thought of another and in the 2 seconds it took to open the app up i forget what the symptom was
vQRh_VMA7Vc,you just described me during math class
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Relatable
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"@I won’t like your comment 😭 painful, for me its more like fighting with my close friends, parents, or any other person i know without realizing and ending up hurting my feelings with their hurtful words in my daydream ;-;"
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"@Kirb so i do have adhd then, i sure hope not. But reading this comment is kinds the same for me"
vQRh_VMA7Vc,@sofia ! no it’s mine sorry
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"@Fatty Hacks ohh sorry, I thought you meant I didn’t have adhd or something and I was just using it as a trend. My bad"
vQRh_VMA7Vc,@sofia ! I was diagnosed too but I discovered I can turn my adhd into my biggest accomplisher.... but the trend of looking at the first comment and then keep reading cause I felt for it too lol
vQRh_VMA7Vc,@Fatty Hacks followed what trend? I’ve literally been diagnosed with adhd lmfaoo
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Because u followed the trend
vQRh_VMA7Vc,oh i struggle writing essays because my thoughts wanders elsewhere all the time😐
vQRh_VMA7Vc,@Emily Barnson 😂😂
vQRh_VMA7Vc,I’m undiagnosed but I can write a bunch of essays in my head and forget to write the actual one
vQRh_VMA7Vc,@frickity frack and I thought that was normal behaviour. Sad life
vQRh_VMA7Vc,ME TOO! I’m so good at Essays but actually sitting down and doing them let alone completing them ...... a whole different story....
vQRh_VMA7Vc,thanks for this video I haven&#39;t been diagnosed but when I told my mum about my trouble paying attention she told me my dad and brother had add (adhd) which I never knew
vQRh_VMA7Vc,you just need to try harder :P
vQRh_VMA7Vc,YES
vQRh_VMA7Vc,@Sharmine Desirie SAMEEEEE!!!!!
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Damn m8 im also like tht....it kinda feels sad sometimes :*(
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"Same, I’m so exited to get on Genshin impact but then I just take a few photos check if my friends are online and leave lol"
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"@rosequartzite yeah it&#39;s the same with me too, I&#39;ve been passionately thinking about painting something from past 2-3 months but I&#39;m not getting any equipments for painting coz i know I&#39;ll easily get bored the moment I&#39;ll start painting. There are so many things i want to do but coz of my lack of focus on one thing I&#39;m unable to do."
vQRh_VMA7Vc,If your taking cocaine then. Don’t? Talk to a doctor for treatments of adhd if you feel you might have it
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Mr. Dank was thinking the same. Speed works
vQRh_VMA7Vc,HAHHAHA SO QUIRKY LOL!!
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Same dawg
vQRh_VMA7Vc,@Thea exactly 😂
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"Fãvørìtë Jäñé Sorry, but thinking class is boring, and its hard to focus, doesnt mean u have a disorder or something like that.."
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Julianne Dedrick same
vQRh_VMA7Vc,@Missy Willig 😂😂
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"@Smile Maybe. if you do your research, relate a lot, and think there&#39;s a chance you could have it, then you should consider going to a psychologist or something to see if you can get diagnosed"
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Same every single day and it&#39;s not fun I can&#39;t focus wait I have all of these symptoms does that means I have adhd?.....
vQRh_VMA7Vc,@bruh yeah like having to start over relearn and get good at new things when I shoulda just stuck with the ones before gets really unmotivating
vQRh_VMA7Vc,@JayValentin0 that is damn relatable. it feels like ive came up with a new career choice twice a year since i was about 4. Not a clue what i&#39;m going to do now
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"think u have it. If not but improved anyways, than do what works?"
vQRh_VMA7Vc,meditation affects decision making
vQRh_VMA7Vc,this is due to character growth :D
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"I always talk back to my teacher and answer logically. Its just I dont even get any feeling that keeps me down from talking, its just like having a conversation."
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Slay Kings My teachers let me draw now- <br>Like last year my math  never let me draw. And one day she pissed me off and I refused to give her my sketch book
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"@three dogs in a tenchcoat they don&#39;t call it a disorder, because it&#39;s not usually  severe. And it is <b>very</b> common. 1 in 10 people have alexithymia"
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Little Sailor <br>Nvm I just looked it up XD<br>Technically that would be considered a disorder. I suppose
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Mm explain. Idk what that means XD<br>If it does affect your work though than maybe talk to a doctor.
vQRh_VMA7Vc,@three dogs in a tenchcoat pretty bad alexithymia
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Little Sailor <br>Well what’s your “personality trait”?
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Dagobert Duck Ur not alone
vQRh_VMA7Vc,I seem the only one with ADD
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"not everyone with ADHD will fail! I get B&#39;s and A&#39;s and C&#39;s! I&#39;ve gotten 2 D&#39;s (so far). Thanks for sharing, It makes me feel happy!"
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"I don&#39;t really know what you mean. But yes, we do remember what we did and what we&#39;ve done wrong."
vQRh_VMA7Vc,K Vlogs because.. u cry alot? Lol
vQRh_VMA7Vc,somehow i am suppose to pretend I don&#39;t know what adhd is in order to get diagnosed for it geez. Find a doctor who trusts his patient or just fake a story about all of dsm symptoms of adhd and than see if the medication works for you. Bc fuck other people I know the best?
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"Dogs and Gooses forever I think you’d have to get diagnosed to get the right meds yk? I don’t know, I’m not diagnosed but it’s obvious I have it eheh..but if you could find adhd meds and if it’s helps then your most likely to have it"
vQRh_VMA7Vc,I think i have adhd<br>Do i HAVE  to get diagnosed tho? Like is getting diagonsed or taking meds make a big difference
vQRh_VMA7Vc,I relate to you so much
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Same alot of what I feel are symptoms of ADHD could just be some symptoms from anxiety overlapping so it&#39;s hard to tell
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Thats me when I have a frustration Aggression breakdown. And that happenes a lot.
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"Me: I lasted till <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQRh_VMA7Vc&amp;t=0m10s"">0:10</a> ,then I took out my pen, and started fiddling and doodling on my hand, and guess what? I got expelled for doodling all over the tables and books, and also becoming that level of impulsive to start a civil war against two classes, I got expelled from 8 different schools in 7 different academic years... all because of impulsiveness, and I HOPE THAT SOMEDAY, STUDENTS WITH ADHD GET A SPECIAL CLASSROOM, FIT FOR OUR LEVEL OF TIME PASS... wait, I just wrote a novel! Yaay, Now I’ll just halt my speech and leave us glum people with ADHD to be free."
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Dodo Scarf Medical records
vQRh_VMA7Vc,@YIPPIES But how do they know if you have it?
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Dodo Scarf I don’t think it matter too much in the US but in the UK you are excluded from a lot of jobs.
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Do you have to put that in your resume?
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Here!!!
vQRh_VMA7Vc,ayyyyy
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"mattR Mega actually bro, I have more of an Initiative side to things. 14 symptom, severe. And I agree with your comment completely, I am also Narcissistic, and Megalomanic. You see you won’t live very long with an attitude as ignorant as yours? No insult towards you, but it’s true. You just replied to somebody, for making a senseless comment, that hurt nobody. Nobody but your intelligence. You don’t like seeing happy people because you’re depressed, alone, and ignorant(in the rude way). I am the same, but I have my Morals, and rules."
vQRh_VMA7Vc,I am here brother
vQRh_VMA7Vc,@mattR Mega thank u for curing adhd with your comment king &lt;3
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Micah Vanderweide also makes sense because I have the hyperactive type
vQRh_VMA7Vc,@Scary Mclairy that makes sense I have the inattentive type which basically means I can occasionally force myself to focus on things with some strategy involved. Almost every second of the day I&#39;m zoned or lost in thought and will time because outside information just isn&#39;t important enough. Other times it&#39;s constant a constant inability to just think about one thing because something new grabs my attention every few seconds
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Micah Vanderweide the word ‘Distraction’ is a word that explains my life. ‘Paying attention’ seems so foreign to me. They do not go together
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"@Scary Mclairy neither can I but if try to pay attention to something you can, even if it means doing something else or a couple things at the same time to distract the over active part of your brain, it&#39;s a big reason we all fidget in school, distracting yourself is a great way to focus for adhd people"
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Micah Vanderweide it’s litterally 6 minutes. For me- I can’t even pay attention to a 45 second video.
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"every single time, and i mean <b>every single time</b> i&#39;m last to finish anything in class. i think its because i cant pay attention and i spend 20 minutes on one question trying to figure out what it means then later complaining the teacher didn&#39;t teach us it which they did"
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Adderal. 40 Mg at 14 in 8th grade.
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Ok
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Lmaooo I was watching this and then went to click the back arrow and thought to myself &quot;ooohhhhhhhh&quot; Lol
vQRh_VMA7Vc,I found myself dazed thinking about other things unrelated to the video. don&#39;t even remember what now lol. had to go back and read the doodles in the video to know what went on
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Literally once they said add and ADHD were the same I stopped lol
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Depends on what you find engaging. I enjoy good educational videos
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Most people enjoy things they can relate to.
vQRh_VMA7Vc,So*
vQRh_VMA7Vc,@S4K _Voidzz do I might have both
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"@S4K _Voidzz I feel like autism affects literally everything, from your social skills to your perception of the world and the way you act, while ADHD &quot;only&quot; is more related to energy and attention.<br><br>People often forget that a bit part of autism is hypersensitivity to some sounds/smells/colors/etc. It&#39;s not only not knowing how to communicate !<br><br>Good luck on getting a diagnosis btw x&#39;)"
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"@BananaMan there not the same but the are close. Autism is more of a social thing but ADHD is more of not focusing and continuously moving, I was diagnosed with severe ADHD and might have mild autism"
vQRh_VMA7Vc,They missed diagnosed me with Autism i have ADHD also  Autism and adhd have the same symptoms
vQRh_VMA7Vc,@will simpson same
vQRh_VMA7Vc,espiecally with aot or when they feed you alot of info i think i am focusing and realised a couple of secs later ive got no clue whats going on
vQRh_VMA7Vc,@NerdyMcNerderson I am the exact same😏😏
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Ugh just yesterday I opened tab for hanako kun and ended up opening another tab and watched something else lmao
vQRh_VMA7Vc,I’m so glad I’m not the only one! While in the middle of watching anime I pause it and go do something else for a bit... I’m not sure if it’s because it’s boring or something else (jojos bizarre adventure is sure as hell not boring to me)<br>It took me a 3 months to finish part 1 😬
vQRh_VMA7Vc,@*Olivia idk* man same but at the same time i feel like I&#39;m failing srsly i wasn&#39;t able to do my homework on time
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Same but idk if I have ADHA 😅
vQRh_VMA7Vc,I have most of those......
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"@*Olivia idk* same, I have ADHD, Anxiety and PTSD but my grades are great and I&#39;m a medical student now. Wow, after reading my own comment I realised how messed up I am!"
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"You have some symptoms but not all, like forgetting easily and forgetting where you have put your stuff, being disorganized and having problems with multitasking, but I don&#39;t really know, so you better go to a psychiatrist:)."
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"same, when i try to focus on something i zone out saying &quot;focus&quot; in my head and never actually focus"
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Does it like makes you want to rub your eyes?
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"Bruh amirite, i have to literally yell at myself to stay focused, and even so then i start to get a headache until the inattentive moment is over or I forget im supposed to be focusing"
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Tatiana Torres Same with my head
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Dina campos lopes that’s why michael Phelps started swimming!
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Same here.
vQRh_VMA7Vc,youre so nice I hate it when kids are mean to me because  or they don&#39;t want to be my friends cause I have ADHD and ASD
vQRh_VMA7Vc,I’m life
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Literally going through same ahit at work I am a wwlder/fabricator foreman explains everything to me seconds I forgets everything or fuck up most of things how did you manage it on job? I am really struggling
vQRh_VMA7Vc,This is my life :-(
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Hey ❤❤❤ i know what you mean :(
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"also, the one makes you realize that you don&#39;t need those grades, getting 100 at something doesn&#39;t change shit? I could be forcefully subjected to study and tested on any object but chances are I will remember practically 0. All I remember from high school as a graduate are these: Writing (complex writing), mitochondria are the powerhouse of the cell and that you need to ask the teacher for permission to go for a peeing and drinking water session :D I&#39;m in uni now."
vQRh_VMA7Vc,i’m watching this instead of starting my project that’s due tomorrow that i forgot about
vQRh_VMA7Vc,@Daniel Cox I can’t even study
vQRh_VMA7Vc,watching this instead of doing my essay that&#39;s due today which is the only way to bring my grade up to atleast a 70
vQRh_VMA7Vc,watching this instead of life
vQRh_VMA7Vc,I’m supposed to be cooking but well.....
vQRh_VMA7Vc,From personal experience (so I may not be speaking for everyone) it depends on what I was destracted by. Say Im doing my homework and I get destracted by a game of some sort (same goes for anything really interesting like wiki articles about quantumn physics) I will easily continue with that distraction for hours on end without thinking about anything else. Even if there is something potentially more interesting but is less instantaneously gratifying.
vQRh_VMA7Vc,I relate to that
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"@melon me too :( but if it helps you, then it&#39;s nothing to be ashamed about. those people need to be a little more open minded ;~; ♡"
vQRh_VMA7Vc,People get mad at me when I put on captions 😓
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"same with subtitles, when I zoom out I can just rewind video back a little bit and quickly read subtitles<br>I&#39;m trying to watch everything with subtitles, it really helps"
vQRh_VMA7Vc,it&#39;s defiantly mainly genetic. since my family for generations have struggled with it.
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Meds can do it but it&#39;s also generic and can be environmental.
vQRh_VMA7Vc,•Smol Alien Gacha• did you go to the dr to get your adhd by if you didn’t don’t say that you have it
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Well then I suppose it means very little you. I hope one day you become a believer. To an atheist I guess it would be like a less important good luck.....
vQRh_VMA7Vc,@TJ Jones what dose god bless mean I&#39;m in middle school and well I&#39;m an atheist and a nacissict sir..... 0_0
vQRh_VMA7Vc,<b>GOD</b> BLESS.......not good ( dumb spell check
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"You are what you make of it. Keep your head up. I am technically Bipolar, ADHD, mild CP, social anxiety disorder, ect and as you grow you will learn what works for you. It&#39;s not easy at times but nothing good comes easy. Natural meds help me on bad days but it&#39;s not for everyone. Talk to your parents/care givers and doctors about CBD oil. It helps me with my anxiety and some what with ADHD and mood. <b>IM NOT SAYING DO IT, IM NOT A DOCTOR OR MEDICAL PERSON</b> I&#39;m just saying there are options available that are safer than some drug store drugs IF YOU feel you need them.<br><br>(Sorry had to throw a disclaimer in there)<br>Keep your head up it DOES get easier as you grow and figure out why you do what you do. Good Bless."
vQRh_VMA7Vc,@Emma Mills youre so nice you know how it  fell people think we keep playing or not doing our work because we fell like it is not true is cause we have ADHD it makes us hard to do our work
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Well i keep telling her to go do her work and she just keeps on playing
vQRh_VMA7Vc,NO......it runs in families and some meds can eventually cause it but no working next to someone with it will NOT give you it. (If your serious)
vQRh_VMA7Vc,ADHD won&#39;t kill you......I would worry about heart problems more😉
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"Yup. Best part when someone yells at you and you can barely focus anyways, haha"
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Going thro this as well I was diagnosed with adhd as a kid then PTSD as an adult do to certain shit I experienced in life but I ain&#39;t getting no meds but soon I believe ima have to idk wtf is going on I been like this for so long I be feeling so lost at times smh and the weed ain&#39;t doing it nomore I mean it soothes me a tad bit but ain&#39;t doing me no good its been two days I haven&#39;t slept my brain dont let me then I fall asleep to have same occurring dreams people trying to kill me an me having to kill them because of my near death experience i had someone trying to kill me as a teenager
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Same!
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"Same whenever im in an extremely stressful moment, my brain locks up and It seems I have no ounce of focus present. its rlly frustrating bc i need to be moving and thinking fast in those moments"
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Yes it does! May sound counter intuitive but get you heart rate up with physical activity. You probably know this but get moving and burn out your body which helps quite the mind.
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Shit this is me at math. I didn&#39;t even realize I was doing this. Also at college too. Shit.
vQRh_VMA7Vc,omg same LMAOO
vQRh_VMA7Vc,NGEPRONE GEMING I have ADHD when I was just a kid but I found out only a few months ago
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Same I can&#39;t focus too is like I can&#39;t help it and idk why and I told myself to focus I still got distracted
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"Glad I&#39;m not the only one, thought I&#39;m the only worst in the world"
vQRh_VMA7Vc,@꧁ღ.shibaunicorn.ღ꧂ damn
vQRh_VMA7Vc,@Aliv3n Nuk3 factss!
vQRh_VMA7Vc,@TJ Jones I think i know that person ive read it somewhere
vQRh_VMA7Vc,@KAMIKAZE 619  😅 ok
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Youre the special one<br><br><b>INHERIT YOUR EXISTANCE</b>
vQRh_VMA7Vc,angeleyes9677 idk IS IT
vQRh_VMA7Vc,@NO TABOOS<br>What mental issue do you have that caused you to think you where smarter than I psychologist? Hm?<br>Also wtf does your comment even mean huh?
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Okay boomer
vQRh_VMA7Vc,@no taboos adhd isn&#39;t caused by brain chemistry. it&#39;s caused by something being wrong with the frontal lobe.<br><br><br>the 2 most common causes of adhd are actually a smaller frontal lobe due to genetics and damage to the frontal lobe from trauma. parenting isn&#39;t going to fix a issue like adhd and adults have adhd to it&#39;s just less noticeable cause has they grew their brains got bigger so their frontal lobe is bigger to.but it is a life long iusse.
vQRh_VMA7Vc,@Marina Cover brain chemistry is highly dependent on environment and behaviour. Happy loving parents can still have no idea how to encourage hobbies and interests in a child. How many hobbies do you have?
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Just because you personally do not experience something or do not understand it does not mean that it does not exist. I have happily married parents who are loving and incredible. ADHD is a chemical imbalance in the brain. If you compare brain scans of someone with ADHD to someone with a neurotypical brain you can see a huge difference in brain activity. This is because people with ADHD produce less dopamine and norepinephrine in their frontal lobe.
vQRh_VMA7Vc,broooh so what were your results?
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Veronica playz YO!! Is that why they stopped suspending me and started just sending me home?! Omg no wonder!
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Veronica playz what is a 504 plan????
vQRh_VMA7Vc,@zachilex bruh
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Good luck...... don&#39;t worry if you do have. You just will have to learn ways to deal with it but it&#39;s nothing like a disease. You still can do what you want when you want just will have to be more creative than some to do the same things. You got this!😁
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"Facebook, YouTube, Twitter is actually trying to get the most hours watched of your time so everything is getting more catchy and addictive. Don&#39;t download the apps that Bing when you get a message actually use the tool bar to get to the sights.......it&#39;s less addictive/distracting"
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Same
vQRh_VMA7Vc,SAMEMEMMEME
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Bro I thought I was 20 minutes in- I&#39;m only 2
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Me too.
vQRh_VMA7Vc,I zoned out about 3 or 4 times
vQRh_VMA7Vc,@Lillian Reichel That&#39;s awesome! With the right people it is only a small set back in the grand scheme of things. It only disables as much as we let it. Good luck with things! God Bless
vQRh_VMA7Vc,@TJ Jones for sure goodness! I&#39;m thankful my professors are really cooperative with me. My ADHD is horrible and they are so supportive
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Right! My father was held back in elementary school way back when they thought it was just &quot;misbehaving&quot; he also got smacked with the ruler also for the same things related to ADHD his parents blamed him and he blamed himself since it wasn&#39;t a thing back then......now he is head at his job in his department and others are asking him for help. Luckily we weren&#39;t raised in that generation!
vQRh_VMA7Vc,@TJ Jones for sure! I&#39;m just glad there are resources out there to give me an idea!
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Right it&#39;s good to get an idea but as grow old you will learn exactly how it works and come up with tricks. Looking it up does help but time helps even more for specifics
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Sorry but it doesn&#39;t go away
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"@jamie All of those I do, and yes I was diagnosed only with the attentive type.  Kids like @Skylar out here thinking ADHD is similar to some disorder that’l make you go on a rampage 24/7 when its not actually how it works, its ridiculous."
vQRh_VMA7Vc,@I don’t know if anyone else is going to be there do you struggle to get tasks done. What about when you are in lectures is it insanely difficult to listen and concentrate to what the lecturer is saying. Do you daydream a lot.
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"@Skylar  Dude I have ADHD too, its not that bad. I just have the mild attentive one."
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Slayerzsx06 even though I have it all I know is that it makes me go crazy and that ADHD means attention deficit hyperactivity disorder lol
vQRh_VMA7Vc,@Skylar  true
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"@Orlaith Heggarty Moore Im not really arguing about what adhd is and is not, im just understanding that this person can research it as much as we can and be objective like I was. I choose to trust. He may not know that focusing amazingly on video games is also adhd for instance? It may be the reason he said that afterall :hmmm emoji:."
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"@Orlaith Heggarty Moore they just disappear when you open your eyes. Look at my school textbooks and always full of drawings all the time too. It seems though that my anger is slow burning unlike yours. It stays there for years but never makes me impulsive. I relate to you, currently im seeing a psychiatrist and been diagnosed(mis) with depression. I will discuss my behaviours more carefully on our next session before taking his antidepressants. (im ok really, no depression here, just adhd) I can also focus very well if I eat choclate, like I can do things actually :D."
vQRh_VMA7Vc,@Anan Baban because he has trouble focusing in class. Literally everyone has trouble focusing in class school is boring isn&#39;t a rare thing not to be able to focus in class. What&#39;s rare is literally blanking out and half an hour finding scribbles all over you pages you don&#39;t remember doing. What&#39;s rare is having Anger fits so extreme that you pass out after. What&#39;s rare is thinking you&#39;ve seen a monster in the corner of your room even though you&#39;re a fully grown adult<br> Just having trouble focusing isn&#39;t ADHD.
vQRh_VMA7Vc,@Orlaith Heggarty Moore Why do you think he might have it from my pov?
vQRh_VMA7Vc,@Anan Baban Again ADHD DOESN&#39;T EFFECT YOU AT ONLY ONE POINT IT EFFECTS YOU ALL THE TIME. This person is probably very young and has read stuff about on the internet and has convinced themselves they have it when they don&#39;t. It happens all the time that&#39;s why ADHD is one of the most over diagnosed illnesses ever.
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Lol I post long comments because my mind is racing and thinking of more to say. But I agree I hate long comments. Rofl
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"the main issue people with adhd have is their executive functions are out of control cause dopamine is mainly used by the brain to control executive functions. executive functions are things like attention control,working memory and so much more."
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Its not his fault. Help him instead. He&#39;ll need it.
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Runs in families but some meds for emotional health can seem to cause it so if your on other meds it could cause it.
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Get a fidget toy. (Don&#39;t need to buy one made for this) something like a pen or that blue poster putty works good as a (I&#39;m not crazy with a &quot;special toy&quot;) figet toy. The pen can drive a teacher nuts from clicking it and poster putty turns hands blue a little but they work if you can&#39;t get normal putty or a fidget toy.<br><br>Good luck. Sorry about the length I know it&#39;s hard to read 😆
vQRh_VMA7Vc,YES!!!!!! I told my pill pusher (doc) that I can play video games for an hour no issue.....she said you like it and it&#39;s made to grab your attention and is always changing lolol. I also enjoy big projects like tanning animal hides and can spend hours just working on one hide even skipping lunch. If you really enjoy it it&#39;s MUCH easier to concentrate. ADHD for over a decade and counting 😉
vQRh_VMA7Vc,My source is from a scientific journal that I read.
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"It is a symptom. I find youtube videos very I interesting and I can pretty well focus on them. However, despite the fact that I want to study and do good i find it difficult to stay focused. So, to answer your question, yes it is a symptom."
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Yeah but funny because I find my self like &quot;no way that&#39;s why I do that&quot; lolol
vQRh_VMA7Vc,I have ADD too so I kinda understand where you are coming from.
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"I have ADD too, and I don&#39;t understand why he says it&#39;s an outdated term, when I got diagnosed not even a month ago (No offense, I&#39;m just confused. I guess that ADD is some kind of ADHD disorder, and it&#39;s also called the silent ADHD. <br>What side effects does ADD medicene have? (I&#39;m thinking about starting on medication)"
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Same
vQRh_VMA7Vc,me too but I dont have adhd
vQRh_VMA7Vc,@IdOmge 😂😂😂
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Yea I&#39;d rather read the comments
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"@꧁Haley Dreamsky ꧂ I know how that fells and people in my school will bully me  about it too, like I guess if I  forget to take my meds or  they didn&#39;t work they will say jokes about it,  i forget my medinice or something like that, Its so hard ignoing them last year someone was bullying me for something and I got in trouble cause I punched him for making fun of me and I ended gotten in school suspended for  a day.  at least now its harder for anyone to bully me since I don&#39;t see them."
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"Yup get away from TV, cell phones, or windows. Play music but Bluetooth it to a speaker in the room and no words. Or not much. I like to look up hour long &quot;nortic music&quot; and &quot;tecno no words&quot; type that in for good concentration music. No distractions 😁"
vQRh_VMA7Vc,@three dogs in a tenchcoat Of course Adderall is used in treating ADD and ADHD
vQRh_VMA7Vc,They only brought it up so people could know the multiple treatments. Also one of the treatments is actually adderall.
vQRh_VMA7Vc,same😭
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Same.
vQRh_VMA7Vc,bruh same
vQRh_VMA7Vc,😃👍
vQRh_VMA7Vc,I just opened the video and opened the comments to read everything except for actually listening to the video.
vQRh_VMA7Vc,😂💯
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Within 1 sec to the comments 😂
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"Oh no, do i have adhd?<br>Jk jk jk ofc not"
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Id0mg said it well. It is controllable but not forever. It feels great to do it and not doing it is uncomfortable. You feel the urge and want to do it and if you resist some times you will do it subconsciously after awhile of waiting. Like shaking my leg in church. I would be try to stop for my mom but would start it again without thinking about it.
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"Dhea Ayu Paramitha im 12, and although we say we ‘cant control’ it, it’s normally us carrying on because it makes us feel better? Like a person with Tourette’s hitting them self because it soothes them. It’s very complicated but staying still is like someone kicking your chair on a plane. We do it not because to annoy others- but to get rid of a strange feeling"
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Could be. I&#39;m no Doctor but it sounds like some symptoms
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Meds treat the symptoms not the &quot;disorder&quot; they help but you always have it. For me no drugs worked well so I am now off it.<br>@*JOHN MEEE*- Be careful some meds you can skip but others if took for awhile or at a high dose then quite all together can be dangerous. I&#39;m not a doctor or in the medical field so ask them for a true answer to your drugs you take. You might be fine but do research to make sure it&#39;s safe to do.
vQRh_VMA7Vc,did u ever skip your medincine inpupose? cause u want to go to shcool without it? i kinda do but idk if is should or not
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Same. I didn&#39;t get diagnosed yet but I check all of the symptoms for add
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Same I have add
vQRh_VMA7Vc,ADD is the same as ADHD because it is called attention deficit hyperactivity disorder so basically it’s a episode of adhd!
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"Actually nah, also hyperactivity in adhd is not exactly what you may think of as ADHD."
vQRh_VMA7Vc,I was wondering about this too. Is it possible to have adhd with the reduced dopamine levels and such without hyperactivity?
vQRh_VMA7Vc,you have ADHD  YOU MIGHT NEED MEDICATION CAUSE WHEN I DONT TAK E IT IM VERY HYPER AND I TALK A LOT WHA GRADE R U IN?
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Mike A. I needa perc 30
vQRh_VMA7Vc,A shrink to explain it and a pill pusher if you want to try meds. Your general doc can tell you who he/she recommends
vQRh_VMA7Vc,You still have it😁 once you have it you always have it😅 but don&#39;t worry so do i🤣
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"So......Google it OR temps over 104F, hot and dry skin not sweating, nausea/vomiting, dilutions, dizziness, DON&#39;T give the person any water, DO put ice in a cloth on there crotch and around there neck and under there armpits. Go to the EMERGENCY ROOM THIS <b>IS</b> A MEDICAL EMERGENCY.<br><br><br><br><br>Your random question unrelated now answered?????😝"
vQRh_VMA7Vc,LITERALLY EVERY SINGLE TEACHER I&#39;VE EVER HAD
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Don&#39;t forget being physical active in general
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Yup no 85% with ADHD either you do or don&#39;t have it.😆
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"I have experienced the same my whole life and never realized I had adhd, up until my son was recently diagnosed.. so crazy. 32 years of not knowing what was wrong with me.."
vQRh_VMA7Vc,@V / S i take meds called vyvanse and basically it just helps me control myself more. obviously it doesn’t mean it completely means i’m fine and i don’t have to try to focus or anything but it just means that it helps me when i do try to focus and makes it easier. i hope that makes sense
vQRh_VMA7Vc,@Daniel sorry but pls answer me which med. Do you take and how do you feel after taking them ?tnh
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"Same, but my first year of Kindergarten my teacher being new did not know how to handle a 5 year old girl with un-medicated ADHD. She thought isolation was the solution to the problem. That is not a solution for anything, if anything it makes it worse."
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"⬆️⬆️⬆️⬆️ look up and hit him up helped me out with my anxiety, depression and adhd"
vQRh_VMA7Vc,@Jasin Ker dude the needle is me phobia<br>Get dat shet away from le comment section!
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"Based on your study + experience , may I know if chinese acunpunture will effectively cure ADHD ?"
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Nobody cares
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Misha Misha- yes there is a stigma to the ignorant. Talk to a medical professional about trying CBD oil and any interactions with what you may take now. It can help slow your mind. Also be active and burn yourself out. A tired you is better than a hyper you. Your mind slows down some with exercise
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Kurri punjab di if u live in india and have adhd the best thing i can say is take modafinil..it releases slow dopamine nd helps u a lot take one a day in the morning.. Nd u will change surely be a better person
vQRh_VMA7Vc,ADD has been classified as ADHD-PI; it&#39;s still accounted for.
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Naturally the brain gets distracted easily and it just get better off with practice
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Trust me you will feel out of control hyper people around you will think your on drugs when really you just have adhd XD
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"I looked at the comment all the vid sry, I have adhd witch is TDAH im french bc im quebeker or you know I live in Quebec, so you know I’m adhd, if the comment didn’t make sense sry, I just trew out words, ppl told me 2 try 2 remove my adhd, adhd children just should learn 2 embrace there disorder, it’s something that doesn’t help, but medication doesn’t help ether, or you know didn’t help me, I took 5 different Medics, not at the same time but all did not help, I stopped taking them at 10 witch helped a lot, ppl still can tell easily that I have adhd but it’s a lot better now, I still don’t pay any attention in class but I now lisen more 2 my friends, i started therapy not that long ago, and I learned that what ppl have 2 say is important, if this comment is long, it’s part of my symptom, I just spiral into saying thing that don’t matter with the subject, for example if I talk about my dad, 2 minute later I’m talking about drawing,   <br><br>If this comment did not make sense at all sry, again I’m not erasing this bf it took me 10 mins 2 write this, really this comment at no point at all"
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"SycophanticTeen i was diagnosed with adhd somewhat early, like 10 or sth, but im pretty sure there is sth else below the surface too cause sometimes its not the disorganization of thoughts that harms my performance in life but the actual thoughts."
vQRh_VMA7Vc,SycophanticTeen same. I&#39;ve never been tested for ADHD but I have noticed that I have alot of the symptoms for intentiveness and hyperactivity and it goes back for as long as I remember I just didn&#39;t notice until I started asking questions to myself like... &quot;Why can&#39;t I pay attention?&quot; Or &quot;Why am I always moving?&quot; And I tried taking to my guardians but I don&#39;t think they get it. So I don&#39;t know what to do anymore.
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"i feel bad for the people who dont have the health insurance to see a doctor to get diagnoised, i knew someone with this issue"
vQRh_VMA7Vc,How to know whether we are lazy or not... 😭
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"Okay so I daydream a lot, it&#39;s like I am in my own world, I  space out. I easily forget things like when mom asks me to wash something when she is out I easily forget it. One time I forgot my school bag while getting ready to go to school because I was thinking about something and realised it when my mum told me but I am good at memorizing and doing school stuff, good at studying and I focus well only when it comes to studying. It&#39;s like nothing else interests me. I sometimes zone out in class . It&#39;s like I am not aware of my surroundings. Do I have adhd ?"
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"I wish my mom would do this but I’m just too scared to tell her that I think that I have adhd, I’m afraid she’ll get mad or something like that."
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Thanks that would have been helpful for me when I was a kid but instead of being taken to the psychologist I was getting yelled at and beaten for being too slow to understand or move or anything or quick and wrong which killed my self esteem and made my life pretty hellish.
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"latisom Adverse effects:<br>• GIT: Abdominal pain, Nausea, Anorexia, insomnia,<br>nervousness and fever.<br>• Increase seizure frequency in seizure patients especially<br>if taken antidepressant."
vQRh_VMA7Vc,I use to joke by replying &quot;I&#39;m too poor to PAY attention&quot; it gets then annoyed but satisfied me. BTW now as an adult that ticks me off saying pay attention since I know I try but have trouble
vQRh_VMA7Vc,This makes me smile as I once again randomly pause the video. All the luck to you and power. You can do it.
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Wishing you all the best! I have a son and that was my exact point of view too. My parents never understood what I was going through with ADHD and it was horrible. If he has difficulties I will be much more proactive! Mental health of children was largely  dismissed prior to 2000 in my experience living in the Southern US.

vQRh_VMA7Vc,JanPBtest Keywords to search about it for a better result to sources?
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"Be very careful with this ADHD thing. A lot of it is a non-issue manufactured by pharmaceutical companies in order to make money. This is mostly an American problem because it&#39;s the only country that does not regulate prices of medications, thus opening the floodgates to &quot;manufacturing&quot; disorders in order to sell medicines designed to &quot;cure&quot; them. Do some research, it&#39;s an interesting subject."
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"Plus, if your microbiome is not in equilibrium, dopamine and serotonine (who are produced in the gut, not the brain, well, it&#39;s technically the brain but I meant they are produced in the gut part) are erratically released, because the bacterias in our gut are triggering the neurons releasing it (and many more)."
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"Eli If the DMV What&#39;s your diet ? I think some research suggest that mental disorders are associated with a leaky gut, who absorbs partially digested proteins like gluten for example, acting as neurotoxins."
vQRh_VMA7Vc,i has to restart it like three times
vQRh_VMA7Vc,rebecca finn Why not search for an intestinal dysbiose ? Did you and your family took antibiotics ? A non-balanced microbiome lead to many disorders because dopamine and serotonine are produced by the gut.
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Yousif Abdulaal did you investigate dysbiose ? Bacteria in our gut and gut barrier integrity seems very related to mental disorders. Dopamin et serotonin i.e. are produced in the gut and bacteria are triggering neurons in our gut brain.
vQRh_VMA7Vc,BbangFan Thanks buddy =) ill try that. Good luck with your ADHD!
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"Yousif Abdulaal Well, as a person with ADHD as well, I could totally relate to you. I could also recommend somethings that I use since it&#39;s really difficult to focus. I found that drinking caffeine can help you have more focus. So every morning I exercise and drink anything with caffeine. And I also &quot;try&quot; to have a &quot;to-do-list&quot; Since I tend to get distracted easily.<br><br>Anyways, goodluck with your med school! :D"

Treated me till junior high school but now im 17 and im going through worse symptoms and my mom cant get it through her damned skull that only my psychologist can help me, and not some wizardman in the sky. Its been a year so you probably have gotten tested for it. If the results are positive, keep going with treatment for as long as it takes or it will eat ya from the inside out"
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"Also, if you attend PUBLIC school, your parents can request that the school psychologist see and refer you if needed , depending on what state that you are in. Some public schools call this &quot;special education.&quot;"

vQRh_VMA7Vc,I was diagnosed with adhd I think at 9 and I&#39;m 17 yrs old so I&#39;m still struggling with it it&#39;s hard to focus
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Back when I was 12 (I&#39;m 14 now) I was diagnosed then given medicine but the first few weeks of trying out the medicine were complete HELL and not healthy for my 12 year old mind but my mother thought it was just my anxiety and then got me a therapist for anxiety 🤦‍♀️
vQRh_VMA7Vc,I got diagnosed when I was 9. My mom never told me for 5 years.
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"ADD and ADHD is the same. It&#39;s just that ADD is the old term used. We don&#39;t use ADD anymore. We use ADHD. There are subtypes of ADHD. Which is the predominantly inattentive presentation, predominantly hyperactive/impulsive presentation and the combined presentation. It&#39;s just the same, it just depends what type you have."
vQRh_VMA7Vc,I say I have ADHD/ADD instead of singling on one of them.
vQRh_VMA7Vc,ADHD is a spectrum and now encompasses the condition that used to be ADD.

vQRh_VMA7Vc,"If you have concerns regarding whether or not you have ADD, talk with your parents about seeing your family doctor. He will then either refer you to a specialist for testing, or he will simply diagnose you on the spot following a questionnaire. It&#39;s important to know that there are alternatives to stimulant medication, the biggest thing is to get the treatment early. As somebody who has had their ADD diagnosed later on in life, i can&#39;t tell you how angry i was when i realized how much of my life had been wasted by failing to properly manage my disorder."
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Nick Collinet I&#39;m thirteen and have always been hyperactive.
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Meds made me worse and didn&#39;t work. Now I personally use CBD oil and 5htp as needed. Not saying it&#39;s right for you and it&#39;s not a cure but it helps. No one knows what it&#39;s like unless like us they HAVE IT
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"Hi 5 mate! people like us are processing thoughts and perception better than so call &#39;normal&#39; people. This world can&#39;t accept that there is some people won&#39;t just seep their idealogy without no further question. So when people like us raise a views or explain our thoughts, we were considered psychologically disorder. If we counter their arguments, they label that as denials. They do anything they can, just so the world would just compliance to their rules and orders without further thoughts of our action."

vQRh_VMA7Vc,Lol
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Lmao
vQRh_VMA7Vc,So?
vQRh_VMA7Vc,I looked at the last two words really quickly and thought it said you’re gay
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"sorry, I have to agree with you, Colin. depending on who you speak to ADD and ADHD can be different as there is more than one specific type. I personally have what has been diagnosed by my personal doctor as Inattentive Attention Deficit Disorder, a type of ADD that is usually found later in life because there are little to no symptoms of hyperactivity as a child. ADHD can be used as a name for all attention deficit disorders, but it cancels out some of the more rare types which can lead to a lack of diagnosis for children and teens who really need help."
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"It&#39;s a flawed definition. It lumps together different behavioral types under one definition. I had two children diagnosed with ADD (post-1987), rather than ADHD, because they were not hyperactive, nor did they have impulse control issues. My granddaughter, the daughter of one of those children, clearly has ADHD. She can&#39;t sit still or stay focused, talks over people as they are speaking to her (without hearing what they are saying), and frequently gets into trouble in school. My kids with ADD never got into trouble in school. They are grown, now. He functions very well, is organized, and got straight A&#39;s in college. She also did well in school, though she&#39;s changed majors so many times, I&#39;ve lost count. Her room is a disaster. Her life is a disaster, and she does things on impulse, but she is still not hyperactive. <br><br>The explanation for the types of ADHD are similarly flawed, because the assumption is that impulsiveness is a common characteristic. Also, behavior modification techniques can make some kids worse. I see it in my granddaughter, where the motivators stop working after a while, and the hyperactive behavior gets even more frenetic."

vQRh_VMA7Vc,"+lal Jad no, I meant to emphasize the change in my personality. I am less active because I got very lazy, I am less excitable and happy than I used to be, but I still do get excited often, just less. I am very mellow, but in a calm way I wasn&#39;t before. And lately I have been seeing my self coming back. Reading over what I wrote, I can see how you got that out of what I said, but this is what I meant."
vQRh_VMA7Vc,you have described depression traits ...
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"I&#39;d say about half this video was treatments and medication, so don&#39;t be making that excuse. You could have included more"
vQRh_VMA7Vc,And I have ADHD
vQRh_VMA7Vc,I think the same thing
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"For now we focus exclusively on pathology, not treatments or medication, so no we won&#39;t be making an additional video covering those topics. Thanks for watching!"
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"Arousal in this case doesn&#39;t refer to sexual arousal; in this context, it refers to the state of being alert, awake, and attentive to one&#39;s surroundings. So, some folks with ADHD can be hyposexual, but it&#39;s not necessarily related to their ADHD, I think that&#39;s more emotional and physiological than neurological."
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"Im being sarcastic person,It&#39;s just thought i did back when i was young,now its certain i dont"
vQRh_VMA7Vc,As Insane As possible then you don&#39;t have it. how did you get diagnosed?
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"AGREED 100 PERCENT. I am diagnosed with ADHD, and NOBODY I know actually understands what ADHD is. One of my teachers actually once went &quot;ADHD is just a lie and an excuse for laziness&quot;"
vQRh_VMA7Vc,I have ADHD also<br>And hypoglycemia
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"+Zachary Johnson And as someone who was diagnosed with ADHD at an early stage in childhood, i really agree, but this is also quite common for all things considering mental &quot;anomalies&quot;, and at least here in Sweden, people&#39;s general understanding of ADHD (and similar) seems to have increased a lot just in the latest 5~15 years."
vQRh_VMA7Vc,+Zachary Johnson We agree with you.
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"+Osmosis That is fantastic, we need more mental health awareness. People, parents, or teachers who interact with those who have ADHD rarely understand it."

FWpPFa_O_G0,I need to add more of their songs to my Spotify playlists!
FWpPFa_O_G0,"I don&#39;t. But if you go to <a href=""http://teaching2and3yearolds.com/"">teaching2and3yearolds.com</a> and look for &quot;music&quot; there are posts with different ideas."
FWpPFa_O_G0,I need to check that out!
FWpPFa_O_G0,@Thrifty Wife YOU are so sweet. I appreciate your kind words! ❤️
FWpPFa_O_G0,@Teaching 2 and 3 Year Olds You are my favorite ❤️ Thank you.
FWpPFa_O_G0,So happy they are helpful! Will be sharing more soon!
FWpPFa_O_G0,"Yep! I had a record player in my classroom for awhile! This was after cassettes had come out, and even CDs were available, but I still had a lot of children’s vinyl albums so the record player came in handy. I’ve since moved on! 😁"
FWpPFa_O_G0,@Teaching 2 and 3 Year Olds I will try and record myself soon.
FWpPFa_O_G0,I&#39;d love to hear it!
FWpPFa_O_G0,@Melissa Bruce Such a great idea to add rhythm while also moving the body!
FWpPFa_O_G0,We hit the table or floor where ever you are sitting to make sounds with the song
FWpPFa_O_G0,Thank you!
FWpPFa_O_G0,Annette Tuck - Hap Palmer’s Tao Your Sticks is the best!
FWpPFa_O_G0,23belle - Thank you!
FWpPFa_O_G0,"@Savy Saver - Yes,  those are great books! Thank you!"
FWpPFa_O_G0,The bear hunt and the book The Very Cranky  Bear book!  Or Brown Bear Brown Bear!
FWpPFa_O_G0,Marilyn Phan Oh yes! That’s a favorite!
FWpPFa_O_G0,"thesandrapagethings - My 2 year olds love those songs, too!"
FWpPFa_O_G0,Denine Hicks That’s a great idea to laminate the lyrics and store with theme materials!
FWpPFa_O_G0,We love freeze dance songs but I never thought to play it at clean up. Great idea!
FWpPFa_O_G0,"amandaandfamm - They are not out at all times. I have them in a cabinet and take them out when we are about to join for group time, or when I feel the children have an extra dose of energy and need to get those wiggles out with some music and movement. It just sort of depends on the morning."
FWpPFa_O_G0,Oh yes....Tooty Ta! All of my students have loved that song!
FWpPFa_O_G0,I will definitely look them up. Thank you!
FWpPFa_O_G0,@momschreck  - Thank you!
FWpPFa_O_G0,@Teaching 2 and 3 Year Olds Thanks!  I also have been trying to find them.  If I do I will let you know.
FWpPFa_O_G0,"They were in the classroom when I arrived. I had hoped they&#39;d be on Amazon, but I can&#39;t find them. I will continue to search other places."
FWpPFa_O_G0,I need to check those out!
FWpPFa_O_G0,"Oh yes, we love &quot;We are the Dinosaurs&quot;, also! I need to look into that conference. Thank you!"
FWpPFa_O_G0,Yay! I’d love to see them all too.
FWpPFa_O_G0,"Hi Shabina - It will take me awhile to put together lyrics to all of the songs, but I&#39;ve started with fall: <a href=""https://teaching2and3yearolds.com/preschool-fall-songs-for-circle-time/"">https://teaching2and3yearolds.com/preschool-fall-songs-for-circle-time/</a>"
FWpPFa_O_G0,@Ronnie Pearce - You are so welcome!
FWpPFa_O_G0,Thanks for giving us some starter ideas. Always looking for new songs to add to my collection too
FWpPFa_O_G0,"I just put together a collection of fall lyrics here: <a href=""https://teaching2and3yearolds.com/preschool-fall-songs-for-circle-time/"">https://teaching2and3yearolds.com/preschool-fall-songs-for-circle-time/</a> and will let everyone know as I complete each season/holiday."

FWpPFa_O_G0,"All over the place, to be honest. It&#39;s many, many years worth of lyrics that I found in a variety of places. I am in the process of putting together a blog post with some resources, although they won&#39;t all be what&#39;s in my binder because a lot of it isn&#39;t available anymore. I will let you all know when that blog post is available."
FWpPFa_O_G0,Teaching 2 and 3 Year Olds yes there are..... 😀❤️
FWpPFa_O_G0,Thank you! There are so many good songs out there!
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"Hi! If you&#39;re still having issues with the video, you may reach out to our team via email at support@<a href=""http://osmosis.org/"">osmosis.org</a> 😊"
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"No, has to be professionally diagnosed"
vQRh_VMA7Vc,if it&#39;s trauma caused then it&#39;s not adhd. it&#39;s most likely ptsd.
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"Glad you enjoy them, James! 😊"
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Redditor
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"Hope it helped, Caitlin! 😊"

vQRh_VMA7Vc,"normal child behaviour... is a child running about, a child playing with her stuff in a normal way, instead of throwing it through the room or swapping toys every 3 seconds, a child being able to actually focus on simple taskes (put your shoes away, clean up your room), a child being able to sit still for longer than 3 minutes those are normal children. Having ADHD is NOT that, my child has ADHD, My child can NOT sit still, my Child does not play with other children as other children don&#39;t like her because she is too rough and too loud, my child can not focus on simple tasks and can not finish these tasks, my child is being limited in her development due to her ADHD, My child has extreme Anger outbursts, not the typical screaming and crying because she doesn&#39;t get something she wants but the real outbursts where she screams as if you&#39;re killing her, where she starts hitting you, scratching you, biting you, kicking you and no my child is not a badly raised child. ADHD is real, it is not a cruel stupidity and anyone thinking like that has either not been confronted with a child having ADHD or is in denial."
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Just because you&#39;re not being able to focus on the video doesn&#39;t mean you randomly become diagnosed with ADHD. There&#39;s a lot more than that.

vQRh_VMA7Vc,"my sophomore year of high school i had a french teacher who was from France so she spoke broken english and i was scared to tell her too💀 but i did eventually (she still didn’t understand but it made me feel better regardless) i recommend pulling them aside or emailing them, or even having your parents email them as well if you’re worried about them not reacting appropriately"
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"⬆️⬆️⬆️⬆️ look up and hit him up helped me out with my anxiety, depression ,bpd and adhd"

vQRh_VMA7Vc,Hoorayyyy
vQRh_VMA7Vc,making them tired doesn&#39;t change the fact that they suffer from the inability to focus compared to their peers

vQRh_VMA7Vc,A psychologist I think
vQRh_VMA7Vc,You&#39;re welcome and thanks Mohsin! 😊
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Worst part is that it’s still ridiculously over-diagnosed by doctors
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"⬆️⬆️⬆️⬆️ look up and hit him up helped me out with my anxiety, depression and adhd"
vQRh_VMA7Vc,That’s not how that works but ok

vQRh_VMA7Vc,@IHATENERDS I actually found a video that explains it wayyyyy better

vQRh_VMA7Vc,you sound like an amazing friend i wish my friends would do that-
vQRh_VMA7Vc,ig its cause it needs ur full attention
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Same<br>I don&#39;t even know if I really have it. I don&#39;t even wanna claim I have it because I&#39;m not professionally diagnosed.
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Feel you :(
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"⬆️⬆️⬆️⬆️ look up and hit him up helped me out with my anxiety, depression and adhd"
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"you can be either hyperactive, in attentive or both. thats the spectrum of adhd. some people with adhd prefer to call themselves someone with add because they are on the inattentive side of the spectrum"
vQRh_VMA7Vc,i&#39;d recommend you talk to your parents and go to a doctor and look into getting an adhd assesment :)
vQRh_VMA7Vc,alicia murch same
vQRh_VMA7Vc,maybe not everyone with adhd but i certainly do and i can barely read anything longer than a paragraph because i cant focus and my brain get overwhelmed
vQRh_VMA7Vc,there is still CBT. :) which you can start at any age
vQRh_VMA7Vc,@Exuveum same🤦🏻‍♀️
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Shit it&#39;s ended.
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Wait i didn&#39;t realize it was playing
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Ya it&#39;s actually a curse
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"nah, lofi hip hop makes me too focused on the music instead of whaf i&#39;m supposed to do"
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Zack Anthony I think I have adhd....
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Yea lol but not 15 minutes prolly less
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"sometimes someone will be talking to me and i start walking around in circles and humming to myself and not stopping until their done, same with when i&#39;m trying to sleep, i get out of my bed and start walking around and touching things in my bedroom until i get tired and my eyes get itchy-"
vQRh_VMA7Vc,i relate to this SO MUCH
vQRh_VMA7Vc,That&#39;s My life too smh
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"I&#39;m not a 100% percent sure I have adhd, but I think I have hyperactivity adhd. I do pretty much all of the 9 symptoms you need to have to have it, I&#39;m fairly positive I have it but my parents don&#39;t think so. I just hope I don&#39;t have it."
vQRh_VMA7Vc,This is a complete mood. Like the whole thing.
vQRh_VMA7Vc,i feel the same way! i think i have it but i&#39;m too scared to say anything to my dad
vQRh_VMA7Vc,@TheDudeXD at what point did I mention that. I recommend that you don’t jump to conclusions.
vQRh_VMA7Vc,@poke predator07 Just because you&#39;re distracted or whatever does not mean that you have ADHD
vQRh_VMA7Vc,I think I might have it but HOLY FUCK IS THIS BORING I&#39;VE ZONED OUT READING COMMENTS LIKE 6 TIMES PLS.
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Lmao. I’m entertaining the possibility that it’s possible I have adhd so this is kinda interesting to me also.
vQRh_VMA7Vc,wow that&#39;s an early diagnosis. how did they know?
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"oh, I relate to this so much. Actually, I went through this and both my parents told me that I don&#39;t actually have it and I&#39;m just imagining things, that I&#39;m perfectly fine. But I have so many symptoms, and went through the same experiences that diagnosed people have, so I just insisted that they take me to a doctor, and I made sure to have a serious conversation with them. I would say that you should sit down with your mother and honestly talk about your experiences and also the symptoms you share, as well as like let her know that if you don&#39;t find out now you might regret it for so long and it&#39;ll be stuck on your mind for so long, and isn&#39;t it better to just see if you have it or not? Oof sorry for rambling lol"
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"I have symptoms too, it’s so annoying, I see one birdie look at it for a few minutes and boom the lesson is done"
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"I know a lot of us do have “tics”, though it seems like they’re more classified as their own issue but they do go hand in hand."
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Damn this is too reliable-
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Do you have a sourc?
vQRh_VMA7Vc,How can you say brain chemical imbalances have never been proved and then give evidence that shows it’s real
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Ok so there may be something wrong with me-
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Which medical school did you attend? Facebook?
vQRh_VMA7Vc,ive had anxiety too
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Damn. thats tuff.
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"I have had ADHD since I was born I have gotten bullied for 7 years and I&#39;m only <b>10</b> I hope you get the treatment you deserve! adding to ADHD I was abandoned by my mom and dad I had been in 10 different foster families by 7 months  <i>may</i> have been sexually assaulted when I was little, had depression, anxiety, abandonment issues, social anxiety and so many more so I hope your journey is way better than mine:) I am not asking for pity I am just asking for you to tell someone! So you can get better early on!"
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Yep
vQRh_VMA7Vc,@lpsglossier yea I have that aswell
vQRh_VMA7Vc,I&#39;m literally doing it right now and i haven&#39;t played attention to half the video
vQRh_VMA7Vc,💀 literally doing that rn ...
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"@lpsglossier Did you ask them? It might be your personality too, there are so many of people like that it&#39;s pretty common I think! And so."
vQRh_VMA7Vc,I have had both since I was born :)
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"Yes, It is quite a common symptom. I have ADHD and I constantly pace around the room."
vQRh_VMA7Vc,God bless you 💞
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"I liked how you write, thank you for sharing this . Can you write personal vlogs ?! You are good at this"
vQRh_VMA7Vc,That doesn&#39;t mean that you have ADHD
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"Lol same, that is how I can’t tell if I’ve forgotten to take my meds"
vQRh_VMA7Vc,when I’m doing hw I just end up staring at the wall for like an hour
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Same
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"I dont think thats adhd. I think that just called undisciplined. I have autism, not the same as adhd but its a mental disorder that affects behaviour aswell. And even though my parents knew somehting wasnt right with me, they never let me off the hook for bad behaviour. Even now, at 14, if i say somethjng socially inappropriate (because autism), or offend someone without realising, ill ask for the appropriate punishment.<br><br>Just because i have a reason for my behaviour, i dont have an excuse. I think alot of the time people forget that."
vQRh_VMA7Vc,SEE i struggle w cutting down on the details and making things short and quick 💀💀 thanks a lot adhd
vQRh_VMA7Vc,holy shit that was long lmfao
vQRh_VMA7Vc,i was writing down my symptoms in a notes app and i thought of another and in the 2 seconds it took to open the app up i forget what the symptom was
vQRh_VMA7Vc,you just described me during math class
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Relatable
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"@I won’t like your comment 😭 painful, for me its more like fighting with my close friends, parents, or any other person i know without realizing and ending up hurting my feelings with their hurtful words in my daydream ;-;"
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"@Kirb so i do have adhd then, i sure hope not. But reading this comment is kinds the same for me"
vQRh_VMA7Vc,@sofia ! no it’s mine sorry
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"@Fatty Hacks ohh sorry, I thought you meant I didn’t have adhd or something and I was just using it as a trend. My bad"
vQRh_VMA7Vc,@sofia ! I was diagnosed too but I discovered I can turn my adhd into my biggest accomplisher.... but the trend of looking at the first comment and then keep reading cause I felt for it too lol
vQRh_VMA7Vc,@Fatty Hacks followed what trend? I’ve literally been diagnosed with adhd lmfaoo
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Because u followed the trend
vQRh_VMA7Vc,oh i struggle writing essays because my thoughts wanders elsewhere all the time😐
vQRh_VMA7Vc,@Emily Barnson 😂😂
vQRh_VMA7Vc,I’m undiagnosed but I can write a bunch of essays in my head and forget to write the actual one
vQRh_VMA7Vc,@frickity frack and I thought that was normal behaviour. Sad life
vQRh_VMA7Vc,ME TOO! I’m so good at Essays but actually sitting down and doing them let alone completing them ...... a whole different story....
vQRh_VMA7Vc,thanks for this video I haven&#39;t been diagnosed but when I told my mum about my trouble paying attention she told me my dad and brother had add (adhd) which I never knew
vQRh_VMA7Vc,you just need to try harder :P
vQRh_VMA7Vc,YES
vQRh_VMA7Vc,@Sharmine Desirie SAMEEEEE!!!!!
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Damn m8 im also like tht....it kinda feels sad sometimes :*(
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"Same, I’m so exited to get on Genshin impact but then I just take a few photos check if my friends are online and leave lol"
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"@rosequartzite yeah it&#39;s the same with me too, I&#39;ve been passionately thinking about painting something from past 2-3 months but I&#39;m not getting any equipments for painting coz i know I&#39;ll easily get bored the moment I&#39;ll start painting. There are so many things i want to do but coz of my lack of focus on one thing I&#39;m unable to do."
vQRh_VMA7Vc,If your taking cocaine then. Don’t? Talk to a doctor for treatments of adhd if you feel you might have it
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Mr. Dank was thinking the same. Speed works
vQRh_VMA7Vc,HAHHAHA SO QUIRKY LOL!!
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Same dawg
vQRh_VMA7Vc,@Thea exactly 😂
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"Fãvørìtë Jäñé Sorry, but thinking class is boring, and its hard to focus, doesnt mean u have a disorder or something like that.."
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Julianne Dedrick same
vQRh_VMA7Vc,@Missy Willig 😂😂
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"@Smile Maybe. if you do your research, relate a lot, and think there&#39;s a chance you could have it, then you should consider going to a psychologist or something to see if you can get diagnosed"
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Same every single day and it&#39;s not fun I can&#39;t focus wait I have all of these symptoms does that means I have adhd?.....
vQRh_VMA7Vc,@bruh yeah like having to start over relearn and get good at new things when I shoulda just stuck with the ones before gets really unmotivating
vQRh_VMA7Vc,@JayValentin0 that is damn relatable. it feels like ive came up with a new career choice twice a year since i was about 4. Not a clue what i&#39;m going to do now
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"think u have it. If not but improved anyways, than do what works?"
vQRh_VMA7Vc,meditation affects decision making
vQRh_VMA7Vc,this is due to character growth :D
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"I always talk back to my teacher and answer logically. Its just I dont even get any feeling that keeps me down from talking, its just like having a conversation."
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Slay Kings My teachers let me draw now- <br>Like last year my math  never let me draw. And one day she pissed me off and I refused to give her my sketch book
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"@three dogs in a tenchcoat they don&#39;t call it a disorder, because it&#39;s not usually  severe. And it is <b>very</b> common. 1 in 10 people have alexithymia"
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Little Sailor <br>Nvm I just looked it up XD<br>Technically that would be considered a disorder. I suppose
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Mm explain. Idk what that means XD<br>If it does affect your work though than maybe talk to a doctor.
vQRh_VMA7Vc,@three dogs in a tenchcoat pretty bad alexithymia
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Little Sailor <br>Well what’s your “personality trait”?
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Dagobert Duck Ur not alone
vQRh_VMA7Vc,I seem the only one with ADD
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"not everyone with ADHD will fail! I get B&#39;s and A&#39;s and C&#39;s! I&#39;ve gotten 2 D&#39;s (so far). Thanks for sharing, It makes me feel happy!"
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"I don&#39;t really know what you mean. But yes, we do remember what we did and what we&#39;ve done wrong."
vQRh_VMA7Vc,K Vlogs because.. u cry alot? Lol
vQRh_VMA7Vc,somehow i am suppose to pretend I don&#39;t know what adhd is in order to get diagnosed for it geez. Find a doctor who trusts his patient or just fake a story about all of dsm symptoms of adhd and than see if the medication works for you. Bc fuck other people I know the best?
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"Dogs and Gooses forever I think you’d have to get diagnosed to get the right meds yk? I don’t know, I’m not diagnosed but it’s obvious I have it eheh..but if you could find adhd meds and if it’s helps then your most likely to have it"
vQRh_VMA7Vc,I think i have adhd<br>Do i HAVE  to get diagnosed tho? Like is getting diagonsed or taking meds make a big difference
vQRh_VMA7Vc,I relate to you so much
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Same alot of what I feel are symptoms of ADHD could just be some symptoms from anxiety overlapping so it&#39;s hard to tell
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Thats me when I have a frustration Aggression breakdown. And that happenes a lot.
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"Me: I lasted till <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQRh_VMA7Vc&amp;t=0m10s"">0:10</a> ,then I took out my pen, and started fiddling and doodling on my hand, and guess what? I got expelled for doodling all over the tables and books, and also becoming that level of impulsive to start a civil war against two classes, I got expelled from 8 different schools in 7 different academic years... all because of impulsiveness, and I HOPE THAT SOMEDAY, STUDENTS WITH ADHD GET A SPECIAL CLASSROOM, FIT FOR OUR LEVEL OF TIME PASS... wait, I just wrote a novel! Yaay, Now I’ll just halt my speech and leave us glum people with ADHD to be free."
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Dodo Scarf Medical records
vQRh_VMA7Vc,@YIPPIES But how do they know if you have it?
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Dodo Scarf I don’t think it matter too much in the US but in the UK you are excluded from a lot of jobs.
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Do you have to put that in your resume?
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Here!!!
vQRh_VMA7Vc,ayyyyy
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"mattR Mega actually bro, I have more of an Initiative side to things. 14 symptom, severe. And I agree with your comment completely, I am also Narcissistic, and Megalomanic. You see you won’t live very long with an attitude as ignorant as yours? No insult towards you, but it’s true. You just replied to somebody, for making a senseless comment, that hurt nobody. Nobody but your intelligence. You don’t like seeing happy people because you’re depressed, alone, and ignorant(in the rude way). I am the same, but I have my Morals, and rules."
vQRh_VMA7Vc,I am here brother
vQRh_VMA7Vc,@mattR Mega thank u for curing adhd with your comment king &lt;3
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Micah Vanderweide also makes sense because I have the hyperactive type
vQRh_VMA7Vc,@Scary Mclairy that makes sense I have the inattentive type which basically means I can occasionally force myself to focus on things with some strategy involved. Almost every second of the day I&#39;m zoned or lost in thought and will time because outside information just isn&#39;t important enough. Other times it&#39;s constant a constant inability to just think about one thing because something new grabs my attention every few seconds
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Micah Vanderweide the word ‘Distraction’ is a word that explains my life. ‘Paying attention’ seems so foreign to me. They do not go together
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"@Scary Mclairy neither can I but if try to pay attention to something you can, even if it means doing something else or a couple things at the same time to distract the over active part of your brain, it&#39;s a big reason we all fidget in school, distracting yourself is a great way to focus for adhd people"
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Micah Vanderweide it’s litterally 6 minutes. For me- I can’t even pay attention to a 45 second video.
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"every single time, and i mean <b>every single time</b> i&#39;m last to finish anything in class. i think its because i cant pay attention and i spend 20 minutes on one question trying to figure out what it means then later complaining the teacher didn&#39;t teach us it which they did"
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Adderal. 40 Mg at 14 in 8th grade.
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Ok
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Lmaooo I was watching this and then went to click the back arrow and thought to myself &quot;ooohhhhhhhh&quot; Lol
vQRh_VMA7Vc,I found myself dazed thinking about other things unrelated to the video. don&#39;t even remember what now lol. had to go back and read the doodles in the video to know what went on
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Literally once they said add and ADHD were the same I stopped lol
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Depends on what you find engaging. I enjoy good educational videos
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Most people enjoy things they can relate to.
vQRh_VMA7Vc,So*
vQRh_VMA7Vc,@S4K _Voidzz do I might have both
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"@S4K _Voidzz I feel like autism affects literally everything, from your social skills to your perception of the world and the way you act, while ADHD &quot;only&quot; is more related to energy and attention.<br><br>People often forget that a bit part of autism is hypersensitivity to some sounds/smells/colors/etc. It&#39;s not only not knowing how to communicate !<br><br>Good luck on getting a diagnosis btw x&#39;)"
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"@BananaMan there not the same but the are close. Autism is more of a social thing but ADHD is more of not focusing and continuously moving, I was diagnosed with severe ADHD and might have mild autism"
vQRh_VMA7Vc,They missed diagnosed me with Autism i have ADHD also  Autism and adhd have the same symptoms
vQRh_VMA7Vc,@will simpson same
vQRh_VMA7Vc,espiecally with aot or when they feed you alot of info i think i am focusing and realised a couple of secs later ive got no clue whats going on
vQRh_VMA7Vc,@NerdyMcNerderson I am the exact same😏😏
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Ugh just yesterday I opened tab for hanako kun and ended up opening another tab and watched something else lmao
vQRh_VMA7Vc,I’m so glad I’m not the only one! While in the middle of watching anime I pause it and go do something else for a bit... I’m not sure if it’s because it’s boring or something else (jojos bizarre adventure is sure as hell not boring to me)<br>It took me a 3 months to finish part 1 😬
vQRh_VMA7Vc,@*Olivia idk* man same but at the same time i feel like I&#39;m failing srsly i wasn&#39;t able to do my homework on time
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Same but idk if I have ADHA 😅
vQRh_VMA7Vc,I have most of those......
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"@*Olivia idk* same, I have ADHD, Anxiety and PTSD but my grades are great and I&#39;m a medical student now. Wow, after reading my own comment I realised how messed up I am!"
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"You have some symptoms but not all, like forgetting easily and forgetting where you have put your stuff, being disorganized and having problems with multitasking, but I don&#39;t really know, so you better go to a psychiatrist:)."
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"same, when i try to focus on something i zone out saying &quot;focus&quot; in my head and never actually focus"
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Does it like makes you want to rub your eyes?
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"Bruh amirite, i have to literally yell at myself to stay focused, and even so then i start to get a headache until the inattentive moment is over or I forget im supposed to be focusing"
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Tatiana Torres Same with my head
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Dina campos lopes that’s why michael Phelps started swimming!
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Same here.
vQRh_VMA7Vc,youre so nice I hate it when kids are mean to me because  or they don&#39;t want to be my friends cause I have ADHD and ASD
vQRh_VMA7Vc,I’m life
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Literally going through same ahit at work I am a wwlder/fabricator foreman explains everything to me seconds I forgets everything or fuck up most of things how did you manage it on job? I am really struggling
vQRh_VMA7Vc,This is my life :-(
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Hey ❤❤❤ i know what you mean :(
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"also, the one makes you realize that you don&#39;t need those grades, getting 100 at something doesn&#39;t change shit? I could be forcefully subjected to study and tested on any object but chances are I will remember practically 0. All I remember from high school as a graduate are these: Writing (complex writing), mitochondria are the powerhouse of the cell and that you need to ask the teacher for permission to go for a peeing and drinking water session :D I&#39;m in uni now."
vQRh_VMA7Vc,i’m watching this instead of starting my project that’s due tomorrow that i forgot about
vQRh_VMA7Vc,@Daniel Cox I can’t even study
vQRh_VMA7Vc,watching this instead of doing my essay that&#39;s due today which is the only way to bring my grade up to atleast a 70
vQRh_VMA7Vc,watching this instead of life
vQRh_VMA7Vc,I’m supposed to be cooking but well.....
vQRh_VMA7Vc,From personal experience (so I may not be speaking for everyone) it depends on what I was destracted by. Say Im doing my homework and I get destracted by a game of some sort (same goes for anything really interesting like wiki articles about quantumn physics) I will easily continue with that distraction for hours on end without thinking about anything else. Even if there is something potentially more interesting but is less instantaneously gratifying.
vQRh_VMA7Vc,I relate to that
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"@melon me too :( but if it helps you, then it&#39;s nothing to be ashamed about. those people need to be a little more open minded ;~; ♡"
vQRh_VMA7Vc,People get mad at me when I put on captions 😓
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"same with subtitles, when I zoom out I can just rewind video back a little bit and quickly read subtitles<br>I&#39;m trying to watch everything with subtitles, it really helps"
vQRh_VMA7Vc,it&#39;s defiantly mainly genetic. since my family for generations have struggled with it.
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Meds can do it but it&#39;s also generic and can be environmental.
vQRh_VMA7Vc,•Smol Alien Gacha• did you go to the dr to get your adhd by if you didn’t don’t say that you have it
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Well then I suppose it means very little you. I hope one day you become a believer. To an atheist I guess it would be like a less important good luck.....
vQRh_VMA7Vc,@TJ Jones what dose god bless mean I&#39;m in middle school and well I&#39;m an atheist and a nacissict sir..... 0_0
vQRh_VMA7Vc,<b>GOD</b> BLESS.......not good ( dumb spell check
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"You are what you make of it. Keep your head up. I am technically Bipolar, ADHD, mild CP, social anxiety disorder, ect and as you grow you will learn what works for you. It&#39;s not easy at times but nothing good comes easy. Natural meds help me on bad days but it&#39;s not for everyone. Talk to your parents/care givers and doctors about CBD oil. It helps me with my anxiety and some what with ADHD and mood. <b>IM NOT SAYING DO IT, IM NOT A DOCTOR OR MEDICAL PERSON</b> I&#39;m just saying there are options available that are safer than some drug store drugs IF YOU feel you need them.<br><br>(Sorry had to throw a disclaimer in there)<br>Keep your head up it DOES get easier as you grow and figure out why you do what you do. Good Bless."
vQRh_VMA7Vc,@Emma Mills youre so nice you know how it  fell people think we keep playing or not doing our work because we fell like it is not true is cause we have ADHD it makes us hard to do our work
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Well i keep telling her to go do her work and she just keeps on playing
vQRh_VMA7Vc,NO......it runs in families and some meds can eventually cause it but no working next to someone with it will NOT give you it. (If your serious)
vQRh_VMA7Vc,ADHD won&#39;t kill you......I would worry about heart problems more😉
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"Yup. Best part when someone yells at you and you can barely focus anyways, haha"
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Going thro this as well I was diagnosed with adhd as a kid then PTSD as an adult do to certain shit I experienced in life but I ain&#39;t getting no meds but soon I believe ima have to idk wtf is going on I been like this for so long I be feeling so lost at times smh and the weed ain&#39;t doing it nomore I mean it soothes me a tad bit but ain&#39;t doing me no good its been two days I haven&#39;t slept my brain dont let me then I fall asleep to have same occurring dreams people trying to kill me an me having to kill them because of my near death experience i had someone trying to kill me as a teenager
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Same!
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"Same whenever im in an extremely stressful moment, my brain locks up and It seems I have no ounce of focus present. its rlly frustrating bc i need to be moving and thinking fast in those moments"
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Yes it does! May sound counter intuitive but get you heart rate up with physical activity. You probably know this but get moving and burn out your body which helps quite the mind.
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Shit this is me at math. I didn&#39;t even realize I was doing this. Also at college too. Shit.
vQRh_VMA7Vc,omg same LMAOO
vQRh_VMA7Vc,NGEPRONE GEMING I have ADHD when I was just a kid but I found out only a few months ago
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Same I can&#39;t focus too is like I can&#39;t help it and idk why and I told myself to focus I still got distracted
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"Glad I&#39;m not the only one, thought I&#39;m the only worst in the world"
vQRh_VMA7Vc,@꧁ღ.shibaunicorn.ღ꧂ damn
vQRh_VMA7Vc,@Aliv3n Nuk3 factss!
vQRh_VMA7Vc,@TJ Jones I think i know that person ive read it somewhere
vQRh_VMA7Vc,@KAMIKAZE 619  😅 ok
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Youre the special one<br><br><b>INHERIT YOUR EXISTANCE</b>
vQRh_VMA7Vc,angeleyes9677 idk IS IT
vQRh_VMA7Vc,@NO TABOOS<br>What mental issue do you have that caused you to think you where smarter than I psychologist? Hm?<br>Also wtf does your comment even mean huh?
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Okay boomer
vQRh_VMA7Vc,@no taboos adhd isn&#39;t caused by brain chemistry. it&#39;s caused by something being wrong with the frontal lobe.<br><br><br>the 2 most common causes of adhd are actually a smaller frontal lobe due to genetics and damage to the frontal lobe from trauma. parenting isn&#39;t going to fix a issue like adhd and adults have adhd to it&#39;s just less noticeable cause has they grew their brains got bigger so their frontal lobe is bigger to.but it is a life long iusse.
vQRh_VMA7Vc,@Marina Cover brain chemistry is highly dependent on environment and behaviour. Happy loving parents can still have no idea how to encourage hobbies and interests in a child. How many hobbies do you have?
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Just because you personally do not experience something or do not understand it does not mean that it does not exist. I have happily married parents who are loving and incredible. ADHD is a chemical imbalance in the brain. If you compare brain scans of someone with ADHD to someone with a neurotypical brain you can see a huge difference in brain activity. This is because people with ADHD produce less dopamine and norepinephrine in their frontal lobe.
vQRh_VMA7Vc,broooh so what were your results?
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Veronica playz YO!! Is that why they stopped suspending me and started just sending me home?! Omg no wonder!
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Veronica playz what is a 504 plan????
vQRh_VMA7Vc,@zachilex bruh
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Good luck...... don&#39;t worry if you do have. You just will have to learn ways to deal with it but it&#39;s nothing like a disease. You still can do what you want when you want just will have to be more creative than some to do the same things. You got this!😁
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"Facebook, YouTube, Twitter is actually trying to get the most hours watched of your time so everything is getting more catchy and addictive. Don&#39;t download the apps that Bing when you get a message actually use the tool bar to get to the sights.......it&#39;s less addictive/distracting"
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Same
vQRh_VMA7Vc,SAMEMEMMEME
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Bro I thought I was 20 minutes in- I&#39;m only 2
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Me too.
vQRh_VMA7Vc,I zoned out about 3 or 4 times
vQRh_VMA7Vc,@Lillian Reichel That&#39;s awesome! With the right people it is only a small set back in the grand scheme of things. It only disables as much as we let it. Good luck with things! God Bless
vQRh_VMA7Vc,@TJ Jones for sure goodness! I&#39;m thankful my professors are really cooperative with me. My ADHD is horrible and they are so supportive
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Right! My father was held back in elementary school way back when they thought it was just &quot;misbehaving&quot; he also got smacked with the ruler also for the same things related to ADHD his parents blamed him and he blamed himself since it wasn&#39;t a thing back then......now he is head at his job in his department and others are asking him for help. Luckily we weren&#39;t raised in that generation!
vQRh_VMA7Vc,@TJ Jones for sure! I&#39;m just glad there are resources out there to give me an idea!
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Right it&#39;s good to get an idea but as grow old you will learn exactly how it works and come up with tricks. Looking it up does help but time helps even more for specifics
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Sorry but it doesn&#39;t go away
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"@jamie All of those I do, and yes I was diagnosed only with the attentive type.  Kids like @Skylar out here thinking ADHD is similar to some disorder that’l make you go on a rampage 24/7 when its not actually how it works, its ridiculous."
vQRh_VMA7Vc,@I don’t know if anyone else is going to be there do you struggle to get tasks done. What about when you are in lectures is it insanely difficult to listen and concentrate to what the lecturer is saying. Do you daydream a lot.
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"@Skylar  Dude I have ADHD too, its not that bad. I just have the mild attentive one."
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Slayerzsx06 even though I have it all I know is that it makes me go crazy and that ADHD means attention deficit hyperactivity disorder lol
vQRh_VMA7Vc,@Skylar  true
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"@Orlaith Heggarty Moore Im not really arguing about what adhd is and is not, im just understanding that this person can research it as much as we can and be objective like I was. I choose to trust. He may not know that focusing amazingly on video games is also adhd for instance? It may be the reason he said that afterall :hmmm emoji:."
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"@Orlaith Heggarty Moore they just disappear when you open your eyes. Look at my school textbooks and always full of drawings all the time too. It seems though that my anger is slow burning unlike yours. It stays there for years but never makes me impulsive. I relate to you, currently im seeing a psychiatrist and been diagnosed(mis) with depression. I will discuss my behaviours more carefully on our next session before taking his antidepressants. (im ok really, no depression here, just adhd) I can also focus very well if I eat choclate, like I can do things actually :D."
vQRh_VMA7Vc,@Anan Baban because he has trouble focusing in class. Literally everyone has trouble focusing in class school is boring isn&#39;t a rare thing not to be able to focus in class. What&#39;s rare is literally blanking out and half an hour finding scribbles all over you pages you don&#39;t remember doing. What&#39;s rare is having Anger fits so extreme that you pass out after. What&#39;s rare is thinking you&#39;ve seen a monster in the corner of your room even though you&#39;re a fully grown adult<br> Just having trouble focusing isn&#39;t ADHD.
vQRh_VMA7Vc,@Orlaith Heggarty Moore Why do you think he might have it from my pov?
vQRh_VMA7Vc,@Anan Baban Again ADHD DOESN&#39;T EFFECT YOU AT ONLY ONE POINT IT EFFECTS YOU ALL THE TIME. This person is probably very young and has read stuff about on the internet and has convinced themselves they have it when they don&#39;t. It happens all the time that&#39;s why ADHD is one of the most over diagnosed illnesses ever.
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Lol I post long comments because my mind is racing and thinking of more to say. But I agree I hate long comments. Rofl
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"the main issue people with adhd have is their executive functions are out of control cause dopamine is mainly used by the brain to control executive functions. executive functions are things like attention control,working memory and so much more."
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Its not his fault. Help him instead. He&#39;ll need it.
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Runs in families but some meds for emotional health can seem to cause it so if your on other meds it could cause it.
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Get a fidget toy. (Don&#39;t need to buy one made for this) something like a pen or that blue poster putty works good as a (I&#39;m not crazy with a &quot;special toy&quot;) figet toy. The pen can drive a teacher nuts from clicking it and poster putty turns hands blue a little but they work if you can&#39;t get normal putty or a fidget toy.<br><br>Good luck. Sorry about the length I know it&#39;s hard to read 😆
vQRh_VMA7Vc,YES!!!!!! I told my pill pusher (doc) that I can play video games for an hour no issue.....she said you like it and it&#39;s made to grab your attention and is always changing lolol. I also enjoy big projects like tanning animal hides and can spend hours just working on one hide even skipping lunch. If you really enjoy it it&#39;s MUCH easier to concentrate. ADHD for over a decade and counting 😉
vQRh_VMA7Vc,My source is from a scientific journal that I read.
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"It is a symptom. I find youtube videos very I interesting and I can pretty well focus on them. However, despite the fact that I want to study and do good i find it difficult to stay focused. So, to answer your question, yes it is a symptom."
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Yeah but funny because I find my self like &quot;no way that&#39;s why I do that&quot; lolol
vQRh_VMA7Vc,I have ADD too so I kinda understand where you are coming from.
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"I have ADD too, and I don&#39;t understand why he says it&#39;s an outdated term, when I got diagnosed not even a month ago (No offense, I&#39;m just confused. I guess that ADD is some kind of ADHD disorder, and it&#39;s also called the silent ADHD. <br>What side effects does ADD medicene have? (I&#39;m thinking about starting on medication)"
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Same
vQRh_VMA7Vc,me too but I dont have adhd
vQRh_VMA7Vc,@IdOmge 😂😂😂
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Yea I&#39;d rather read the comments
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"@꧁Haley Dreamsky ꧂ I know how that fells and people in my school will bully me  about it too, like I guess if I  forget to take my meds or  they didn&#39;t work they will say jokes about it,  i forget my medinice or something like that, Its so hard ignoing them last year someone was bullying me for something and I got in trouble cause I punched him for making fun of me and I ended gotten in school suspended for  a day.  at least now its harder for anyone to bully me since I don&#39;t see them."
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"Yup get away from TV, cell phones, or windows. Play music but Bluetooth it to a speaker in the room and no words. Or not much. I like to look up hour long &quot;nortic music&quot; and &quot;tecno no words&quot; type that in for good concentration music. No distractions 😁"
vQRh_VMA7Vc,@three dogs in a tenchcoat Of course Adderall is used in treating ADD and ADHD
vQRh_VMA7Vc,They only brought it up so people could know the multiple treatments. Also one of the treatments is actually adderall.
vQRh_VMA7Vc,same😭
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Same.
vQRh_VMA7Vc,bruh same
vQRh_VMA7Vc,😃👍
vQRh_VMA7Vc,I just opened the video and opened the comments to read everything except for actually listening to the video.
vQRh_VMA7Vc,😂💯
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Within 1 sec to the comments 😂
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"Oh no, do i have adhd?<br>Jk jk jk ofc not"
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Id0mg said it well. It is controllable but not forever. It feels great to do it and not doing it is uncomfortable. You feel the urge and want to do it and if you resist some times you will do it subconsciously after awhile of waiting. Like shaking my leg in church. I would be try to stop for my mom but would start it again without thinking about it.
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"Dhea Ayu Paramitha im 12, and although we say we ‘cant control’ it, it’s normally us carrying on because it makes us feel better? Like a person with Tourette’s hitting them self because it soothes them. It’s very complicated but staying still is like someone kicking your chair on a plane. We do it not because to annoy others- but to get rid of a strange feeling"
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Could be. I&#39;m no Doctor but it sounds like some symptoms
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Meds treat the symptoms not the &quot;disorder&quot; they help but you always have it. For me no drugs worked well so I am now off it.<br>@*JOHN MEEE*- Be careful some meds you can skip but others if took for awhile or at a high dose then quite all together can be dangerous. I&#39;m not a doctor or in the medical field so ask them for a true answer to your drugs you take. You might be fine but do research to make sure it&#39;s safe to do.
vQRh_VMA7Vc,did u ever skip your medincine inpupose? cause u want to go to shcool without it? i kinda do but idk if is should or not
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Same. I didn&#39;t get diagnosed yet but I check all of the symptoms for add
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Same I have add
vQRh_VMA7Vc,ADD is the same as ADHD because it is called attention deficit hyperactivity disorder so basically it’s a episode of adhd!
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"Actually nah, also hyperactivity in adhd is not exactly what you may think of as ADHD."
vQRh_VMA7Vc,I was wondering about this too. Is it possible to have adhd with the reduced dopamine levels and such without hyperactivity?
vQRh_VMA7Vc,you have ADHD  YOU MIGHT NEED MEDICATION CAUSE WHEN I DONT TAK E IT IM VERY HYPER AND I TALK A LOT WHA GRADE R U IN?
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Mike A. I needa perc 30
vQRh_VMA7Vc,A shrink to explain it and a pill pusher if you want to try meds. Your general doc can tell you who he/she recommends
vQRh_VMA7Vc,You still have it😁 once you have it you always have it😅 but don&#39;t worry so do i🤣
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"So......Google it OR temps over 104F, hot and dry skin not sweating, nausea/vomiting, dilutions, dizziness, DON&#39;T give the person any water, DO put ice in a cloth on there crotch and around there neck and under there armpits.

vQRh_VMA7Vc,LITERALLY EVERY SINGLE TEACHER I&#39;VE EVER HAD
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Don&#39;t forget being physical active in general
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Yup no 85% with ADHD either you do or don&#39;t have it.😆
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"I have experienced the same my whole life and never realized I had adhd, up until my son was recently diagnosed.. so crazy. 32 years of not knowing what was wrong with me.."
vQRh_VMA7Vc,@V / S i take meds called vyvanse and basically it just helps me control myself more. obviously it doesn’t mean it completely means i’m fine and i don’t have to try to focus or anything but it just means that it helps me when i do try to focus and makes it easier. i hope that makes sense
vQRh_VMA7Vc,@Daniel sorry but pls answer me which med. Do you take and how do you feel after taking them ?tnh
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"Same, but my first year of Kindergarten my teacher being new did not know how to handle a 5 year old girl with un-medicated ADHD. She thought isolation was the solution to the problem. That is not a solution for anything, if anything it makes it worse."
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"⬆️⬆️⬆️⬆️ look up and hit him up helped me out with my anxiety, depression and adhd"

vQRh_VMA7Vc,"Based on your study + experience , may I know if chinese acunpunture will effectively cure ADHD ?"
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Nobody cares
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Misha Misha- yes there is a stigma to the ignorant. Talk to a medical professional about trying CBD oil and any interactions with what you may take now. It can help slow your mind. Also be active and burn yourself out. A tired you is better than a hyper you. Your mind slows down some with exercise
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Kurri punjab di if u live in india and have adhd the best thing i can say is take modafinil..it releases slow dopamine nd helps u a lot take one a day in the morning.. Nd u will change surely be a better person
vQRh_VMA7Vc,ADD has been classified as ADHD-PI; it&#39;s still accounted for.
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Naturally the brain gets distracted easily and it just get better off with practice
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Trust me you will feel out of control hyper people around you will think your on drugs when really you just have adhd XD
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"I looked at the comment all the vid sry, I have adhd witch is TDAH im french bc im quebeker or you know I live in Quebec, so you know I’m adhd, if the comment didn’t make sense sry, I just trew out words, ppl told me 2 try 2 remove my adhd, adhd children just should learn 2 embrace there disorder, it’s something that doesn’t help, but medication doesn’t help ether, or you know didn’t help me, I took 5 different Medics, not at the same time but all did not help, I stopped taking them at 10 witch helped a lot, ppl still can tell easily that I have adhd but it’s a lot better now, I still don’t pay any attention in class but I now lisen more 2 my friends, i started therapy not that long ago, and I learned that what ppl have 2 say is important, if this comment is long, it’s part of my symptom, I just spiral into saying thing that don’t matter with the subject, for example if I talk about my dad, 2 minute later I’m talking about drawing,   <br><br>If this comment did not make sense at all sry, again I’m not erasing this bf it took me 10 mins 2 write this, really this comment at no point at all"
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"SycophanticTeen i was diagnosed with adhd somewhat early, like 10 or sth, but im pretty sure there is sth else below the surface too cause sometimes its not the disorganization of thoughts that harms my performance in life but the actual thoughts."
vQRh_VMA7Vc,SycophanticTeen same. I&#39;ve never been tested for ADHD but I have noticed that I have alot of the symptoms for intentiveness and hyperactivity and it goes back for as long as I remember I just didn&#39;t notice until I started asking questions to myself like... &quot;Why can&#39;t I pay attention?&quot; Or &quot;Why am I always moving?&quot; And I tried taking to my guardians but I don&#39;t think they get it. So I don&#39;t know what to do anymore.
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"i feel bad for the people who dont have the health insurance to see a doctor to get diagnoised, i knew someone with this issue"
vQRh_VMA7Vc,How to know whether we are lazy or not... 😭
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"Okay so I daydream a lot, it&#39;s like I am in my own world, I  space out. I easily forget things like when mom asks me to wash something when she is out I easily forget it. One time I forgot my school bag while getting ready to go to school because I was thinking about something and realised it when my mum told me but I am good at memorizing and doing school stuff, good at studying and I focus well only when it comes to studying. It&#39;s like nothing else interests me. I sometimes zone out in class . It&#39;s like I am not aware of my surroundings. Do I have adhd ?"
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"I wish my mom would do this but I’m just too scared to tell her that I think that I have adhd, I’m afraid she’ll get mad or something like that."
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Thanks that would have been helpful for me when I was a kid but instead of being taken to the psychologist I was getting yelled at and beaten for being too slow to understand or move or anything or quick and wrong which killed my self esteem and made my life pretty hellish.
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"latisom Adverse effects:<br>• GIT: Abdominal pain, Nausea, Anorexia, insomnia,<br>nervousness and fever.<br>• Increase seizure frequency in seizure patients especially<br>if taken antidepressant."
vQRh_VMA7Vc,I use to joke by replying &quot;I&#39;m too poor to PAY attention&quot; it gets then annoyed but satisfied me. BTW now as an adult that ticks me off saying pay attention since I know I try but have trouble
vQRh_VMA7Vc,This makes me smile as I once again randomly pause the video. All the luck to you and power. You can do it.
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Wishing you all the best! I have a son and that was my exact point of view too. My parents never understood what I was going through with ADHD and it was horrible. If he has difficulties I will be much more proactive! Mental health of children was largely  dismissed prior to 2000 in my experience living in the Southern US.

vQRh_VMA7Vc,JanPBtest Keywords to search about it for a better result to sources?
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"Be very careful with this ADHD thing. A lot of it is a non-issue manufactured by pharmaceutical companies in order to make money. This is mostly an American problem because it&#39;s the only country that does not regulate prices of medications, thus opening the floodgates to &quot;manufacturing&quot; disorders in order to sell medicines designed to &quot;cure&quot; them. Do some research, it&#39;s an interesting subject."
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"Plus, if your microbiome is not in equilibrium, dopamine and serotonine (who are produced in the gut, not the brain, well, it&#39;s technically the brain but I meant they are produced in the gut part) are erratically released, because the bacterias in our gut are triggering the neurons releasing it (and many more)."
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"Eli If the DMV What&#39;s your diet ? I think some research suggest that mental disorders are associated with a leaky gut, who absorbs partially digested proteins like gluten for example, acting as neurotoxins."
vQRh_VMA7Vc,i has to restart it like three times
vQRh_VMA7Vc,rebecca finn Why not search for an intestinal dysbiose ? Did you and your family took antibiotics ? A non-balanced microbiome lead to many disorders because dopamine and serotonine are produced by the gut.
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Yousif Abdulaal did you investigate dysbiose ? Bacteria in our gut and gut barrier integrity seems very related to mental disorders. Dopamin et serotonin i.e. are produced in the gut and bacteria are triggering neurons in our gut brain.
vQRh_VMA7Vc,BbangFan Thanks buddy =) ill try that. Good luck with your ADHD!
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"Yousif Abdulaal Well, as a person with ADHD as well, I could totally relate to you. I could also recommend somethings that I use since it&#39;s really difficult to focus. I found that drinking caffeine can help you have more focus. So every morning I exercise and drink anything with caffeine. And I also &quot;try&quot; to have a &quot;to-do-list&quot; Since I tend to get distracted easily.<br><br>Anyways, goodluck with your med school! :D"

Treated me till junior high school but now im 17 and im going through worse symptoms and my mom cant get it through her damned skull that only my psychologist can help me, and not some wizardman in the sky. Its been a year so you probably have gotten tested for it. If the results are positive, keep going with treatment for as long as it takes or it will eat ya from the inside out"
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"Also, if you attend PUBLIC school, your parents can request that the school psychologist see and refer you if needed , depending on what state that you are in. Some public schools call this &quot;special education.&quot;"

vQRh_VMA7Vc,Why are u telling us that?
vQRh_VMA7Vc,I was diagnosed with adhd I think at 9 and I&#39;m 17 yrs old so I&#39;m still struggling with it it&#39;s hard to focus
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Back when I was 12 (I&#39;m 14 now) I was diagnosed then given medicine but the first few weeks of trying out the medicine were complete HELL and not healthy for my 12 year old mind but my mother thought it was just my anxiety and then got me a therapist for anxiety 🤦‍♀️
vQRh_VMA7Vc,I got diagnosed when I was 9. My mom never told me for 5 years.
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"ADD and ADHD is the same. It&#39;s just that ADD is the old term used. We don&#39;t use ADD anymore. We use ADHD. There are subtypes of ADHD. Which is the predominantly inattentive presentation, predominantly hyperactive/impulsive presentation and the combined presentation. It&#39;s just the same, it just depends what type you have."
vQRh_VMA7Vc,I say I have ADHD/ADD instead of singling on one of them.
vQRh_VMA7Vc,ADHD is a spectrum and now encompasses the condition that used to be ADD.
vQRh_VMA7Vc,he is talking about brainwashed people

vQRh_VMA7Vc,"Nick Collinet same here. I wasn&#39;t diagnosed until a month before my 20th birthday. Meanwhile, I barely squeaked by school and was struggling in college. I actually CRIED when my psychologist diagnosed me, because it made all of my struggling make sense"
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"If you have concerns regarding whether or not you have ADD, talk with your parents about seeing your family doctor. He will then either refer you to a specialist for testing, or he will simply diagnose you on the spot following a questionnaire. It&#39;s important to know that there are alternatives to stimulant medication, the biggest thing is to get the treatment early. As somebody who has had their ADD diagnosed later on in life, i can&#39;t tell you how angry i was when i realized how much of my life had been wasted by failing to properly manage my disorder."
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Nick Collinet I&#39;m thirteen and have always been hyperactive.
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Meds made me worse and didn&#39;t work. Now I personally use CBD oil and 5htp as needed. Not saying it&#39;s right for you and it&#39;s not a cure but it helps. No one knows what it&#39;s like unless like us they HAVE IT
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"Hi 5 mate! people like us are processing thoughts and perception better than so call &#39;normal&#39; people. This world can&#39;t accept that there is some people won&#39;t just seep their idealogy without no further question. So when people like us raise a views or explain our thoughts, we were considered psychologically disorder. If we counter their arguments, they label that as denials. They do anything they can, just so the world would just compliance to their rules and orders without further thoughts of our action."

vQRh_VMA7Vc,Lmao
vQRh_VMA7Vc,So?
vQRh_VMA7Vc,I looked at the last two words really quickly and thought it said you’re gay
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"sorry, I have to agree with you, Colin. depending on who you speak to ADD and ADHD can be different as there is more than one specific type. I personally have what has been diagnosed by my personal doctor as Inattentive Attention Deficit Disorder, a type of ADD that is usually found later in life because there are little to no symptoms of hyperactivity as a child. ADHD can be used as a name for all attention deficit disorders, but it cancels out some of the more rare types which can lead to a lack of diagnosis for children and teens who really need help."
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"It&#39;s a flawed definition. It lumps together different behavioral types under one definition. I had two children diagnosed with ADD (post-1987), rather than ADHD, because they were not hyperactive, nor did they have impulse control issues. My granddaughter, the daughter of one of those children, clearly has ADHD. She can&#39;t sit still or stay focused, talks over people as they are speaking to her (without hearing what they are saying), and frequently gets into trouble in school. My kids with ADD never got into trouble in school. They are grown, now. He functions very well, is organized, and got straight A&#39;s in college. She also did well in school, though she&#39;s changed majors so many times, I&#39;ve lost count. Her room is a disaster. Her life is a disaster, and she does things on impulse, but she is still not hyperactive. <br><br>The explanation for the types of ADHD are similarly flawed, because the assumption is that impulsiveness is a common characteristic. Also, behavior modification techniques can make some kids worse. I see it in my granddaughter, where the motivators stop working after a while, and the hyperactive behavior gets even more frenetic."

vQRh_VMA7Vc,"Nope. You are born with it, and you have it for the rest of your life. It&#39;s just the way your brains are wired. Symptoms can get less severe as you reach adulthood though."
vQRh_VMA7Vc,Laura Hebert maybe try stimulants
vQRh_VMA7Vc,+Elle The Gamer <br>so I misunderstood your description .<br>but good you are not depressed :)
vQRh_VMA7Vc,+Elle The Gamer <br>I think I looks at the situation here from my own personal one .<br>I always spot depression symptoms because I suffered from it myself BUT I treated it myself when no medications really helped ..
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"+lal Jad no, I meant to emphasize the change in my personality. I am less active because I got very lazy, I am less excitable and happy than I used to be, but I still do get excited often, just less. I am very mellow, but in a calm way I wasn&#39;t before. And lately I have been seeing my self coming back. Reading over what I wrote, I can see how you got that out of what I said, but this is what I meant."
vQRh_VMA7Vc,you have described depression traits ...
vQRh_VMA7Vc,"I&#39;d say about half this video was treatments and medication, so don&#39;t be making that excuse. You could have included more"

vQRh_VMA7Vc,"Arousal in this case doesn&#39;t refer to sexual arousal; in this context, it refers to the state of being alert, awake, and attentive to one&#39;s surroundings. So, some folks with ADHD can be hyposexual, but it&#39;s not necessarily related to their ADHD, I think that&#39;s more emotional and physiological than neurological."

vQRh_VMA7Vc,"+Zachary Johnson And as someone who was diagnosed with ADHD at an early stage in childhood, i really agree, but this is also quite common for all things considering mental &quot;anomalies&quot;, and at least here in Sweden, people&#39;s general understanding of ADHD (and similar) seems to have increased a lot just in the latest 5~15 years."
vQRh_VMA7Vc,+Zachary Johnson We agree with you.

FRvVFW85IcU,"@Denim Hawke how do you see it not proving when every living thing animal or human have this instinct. Something programmed in them, to follow certain habits or needs. And don&#39;t claim that every religion is the same wich is not true at all."
FRvVFW85IcU,"@Fadwa El Fettahi I agree for the someone, definitely &quot;the parents&quot; in the conceiving act and ofcourse &quot;God of the Gaps&quot;. However it still does not prove, which religion or if any religion is actually God&#39;s words as we say it is."
FRvVFW85IcU,Not really &#39;cause if these moral are in thier instinct then that mean someone put it in😉. My own opinion.
FRvVFW85IcU,There could be some bias of the color of toy&#39;s t shirt or the hand in which the researcher is carrying it(baby could choose toy to his right or left always). Just to make sure other factors aren&#39;t working on baby&#39;s decision same experiment should be conducted multiple times on same baby with different environment every time.
FRvVFW85IcU,80% is clearly not random
FRvVFW85IcU,when percentage is 87% the result is pretty clear though
FRvVFW85IcU,Not even.
FRvVFW85IcU,no
FRvVFW85IcU,Same... Guess I&#39;m not as observant as a baby XD
FRvVFW85IcU,"Research has shown that children start developing a more solid sense of empathy at around the ages of nine and ten. That’s because cognitive thought is complex, and children begin acquiring the skill of seeing things from other people’s perspectives as they get older. So yes, there is self-awareness, but there is also more of an awareness toward the other."
FRvVFW85IcU,Older kids probably didn&#39;t want to get judged. That too if they know others will be watching
FRvVFW85IcU,@Tony Midyett I voted for a party that doesn&#39;t even exist. I wrote in the most bizarre name I could come up with. Kadrow Paldatrew 2020! That&#39;s who I wrote in - they don&#39;t exist!
FRvVFW85IcU,"I think is implied that as kids grow older, the culture they grow up with overrides natural instincts, at least to an extent."
FRvVFW85IcU,"I mean, when I was that young I never felt self conscious, I had the urge to be nice to people and generous. Self image issues came after puberty. Personal experience, but others might agree."
FRvVFW85IcU,It’s not.  That’s a demon.<br>AKA alien AKA ghost/jin<br> i.e.:  <b>all The same thing</b>
FRvVFW85IcU,Xin 2 Yu She couldn’t be farther away from understanding children if she tried LOL
FRvVFW85IcU,It can be used as a term of endearment and not necessarily have a  negative connotation
FRvVFW85IcU,"@Xin 2 Yu :  Of course she is not God, no such thing."
FRvVFW85IcU,Trust Valentino hehe... understood ☺️thanks ya...
FRvVFW85IcU,@L. L. I agree.

FRvVFW85IcU,"@Angel Morrison Its wildly brilliant...Wittgenstein saw what most of us just write off as &quot;aww, he&#39;s upset how cute&quot;. Its rage of the most profound kind that a baby is expressing. Yes - a little monster. Not completely depraved (that&#39;d be Calvinist) - but when he&#39;s angry...don&#39;t call it &quot;cute&quot;. Recognize it for what it is"
FRvVFW85IcU,"Isn&#39;t it wild how some can look at the absolute purest form of innocence, and see a depraved little monster there?"
FRvVFW85IcU,@Grace22 Its Wittgenstein - he had brilliant many insights. Aside from that - its evidence for the reality of Original Sin...that kids are born with Concupiscence (as we Catholics call it)
FRvVFW85IcU,Tell us more
FRvVFW85IcU,🥰😂
FRvVFW85IcU,Huh
FRvVFW85IcU,@TheTroll Mastah yo bro this comment no lie is one of the best I have read on a YouTube vid no lie bro
FRvVFW85IcU,The only way you suffer by choosing morality is if you had the wrong intentions in the first place
FRvVFW85IcU,"Right... So a baby can&#39;t understand morality in singular instances but can understand the concept of self-preservation for future enjoyment and less suffering...<br>And even so, that wouldn&#39;t explain why they sided with the bunny that slammed the lid down on the ball thief.<br><br>Your statement about something being moral if it comes with suffering is redundant by the way. If something causes suffering, it becomes an immoral act and instead transfers to &quot;the lesser of two evils.&quot; If the suffering is self inflicted, to spare others, then it&#39;s a sacrificial moral act."
FRvVFW85IcU,"@Abigase Good behavior mostly brings suffering as humans tends to have a habit of walking all over those who do Good which brings forth suffering in a long run as those who prefore to act with  Good behaviour  are the ones who are more likely get bully, and get walk on by others while on the other Hands Bad behaving people most of the time always have the best of Luck with recieving Good things."
FRvVFW85IcU,Exaaaactly
FRvVFW85IcU,@HeroInWonderland how?
FRvVFW85IcU,yes god exists and apparently he made us racist lmfao
FRvVFW85IcU,Maybe because of colour
FRvVFW85IcU,"Unless, like the video showed, it could be the babies prefer that puppet because of a bias.<br>Time Stamp <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRvVFW85IcU&amp;t=7m28s"">7:28</a> - <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRvVFW85IcU&amp;t=8m11s"">8:11</a><br>We saw the &quot;other&quot; puppet get punished and the &quot;bad&quot; puppet (who punished it) got chosen by the babies even though the &quot;good&quot; puppet helped the &quot;other&quot; puppet."
FRvVFW85IcU,That&#39;s where the question lands. Is the baby inherently evil? Or can it be taught to do good or evil? What will their mothers do?
FRvVFW85IcU,Ridita <br>Sorry for mums and not pops?
FRvVFW85IcU,you&#39;re the puppet
FRvVFW85IcU,S V this shor documentary suggests its built in.  Then if the environment is negative thats a double whammy.
FRvVFW85IcU,@Promise N You&#39;re right.
FRvVFW85IcU,"@Add Bow If Girl They don&#39;t only see their parents. We have the internet, teachers, other family. Like with my toxic parent I didn&#39;t become him because I had a positive influence. Im not necessarily a scientist but the effects parents have on their child can be devastating. I may not be a sociopath but I now have some issues. This has been shown in the still face experiment."
FRvVFW85IcU,Promise N <br>You didn’t answer why you believe this. Why do some kids watch their bad parents and resolve to not be like them while other kids internalize the bad behavior and copy it?
FRvVFW85IcU,@Sweet N Sour well yeah that&#39;s what im saying
FRvVFW85IcU,@yasmin thanks i accidentally put empathetic instead
FRvVFW85IcU,It is so sad that science lags far behind philosophy. And both lag even more behind politics. And the struggle for power and wealth. The consequences are tragic.
FRvVFW85IcU,"They imply it. Not only are they sentient, they are moral. Built in."
FRvVFW85IcU,These tests don&#39;t show that...
FRvVFW85IcU,It means they are looking at you ... That&#39;s all you can say until you have mire information about the interaction between you and baby.
FRvVFW85IcU,They study you
FRvVFW85IcU,"In first place, they examine you, then you can see the reaction following your behaviour. 😀"
FRvVFW85IcU,yes. if they stare hard.
FRvVFW85IcU,"Well I think that makes sense for babies they are at that age which they are at the most vulnerable and want parents attention and need parents attention all the time. I doubt they do it because they are being mean but rather because it’s in their nature to survive. To them their whole world is themselves and parents and that’s about it, they are too young to start prioritizing others over themselves or “looking out” for others."
FRvVFW85IcU,Indeed
FRvVFW85IcU,A fallen world
FRvVFW85IcU,Glad I&#39;m not the only one to notice that 🙄
FRvVFW85IcU,Yeah. These should really be done double blind.
FRvVFW85IcU,"They&#39;re not essentially wrong, I mean we can&quot;t fly nor voluntary live in the sewers hahaha"
FRvVFW85IcU,@Olive Papyrus the only difference between the rat/pigeon babies and human babies is that the human babies are way less likely to be eaten alive. The rest is the same haha
FRvVFW85IcU,But rat and pigeon infants are also useless. Unfair comparison.
FRvVFW85IcU,@Wendy Whoisit a comparison that didnt involve rats is something I&#39;d expect XD
FRvVFW85IcU,Well for a long time after we enter this world all we are capable of is lying on our backs and shitting our pants. What did you expect.
FRvVFW85IcU,it’s been proven that kids take more after their peers than their parents.
FRvVFW85IcU,@yasmin Becky doesn&#39;t live in a society. She&#39;s a &quot;rugged individualist&quot;.
FRvVFW85IcU,Every individual is an individual
FRvVFW85IcU,Don&#39;t believe everything you see on the net...
FRvVFW85IcU,@Waterbug He didn&#39;t.
FRvVFW85IcU,Why did God create us to reject him?
FRvVFW85IcU,Amen
FRvVFW85IcU,same
FRvVFW85IcU,@Wesley Heartland lmao
FRvVFW85IcU,"In Christianity, it is the opposite. We are born sinful and through baptism, you are redeemed. I know it&#39;s not scientific but it&#39;s just a little comparison along the lines"
FRvVFW85IcU,"I&#39;m not trying to doubt Islam, as I am a muslim myself, but you shouldn&#39;t take the Quran so literal"

FRvVFW85IcU,F
FRvVFW85IcU,They can be conditioned.  What about the &quot;good puppet&quot; babies that turn into Freddy Kruger.
FRvVFW85IcU,I was told that I popped some old man eyes/his left eye when I was a baby I would say I grew up to be normal not a psychopath
FRvVFW85IcU,ROFL!!!
FRvVFW85IcU,That&#39;s horrible but  I&#39;m still laughing😂
FRvVFW85IcU,Billard De Billbil TOTALLY.
FRvVFW85IcU,Perfect example of CBS stawmaning a point of view to fit the narrative of this segment
FRvVFW85IcU,&quot;little bigots&quot;
FRvVFW85IcU,Creatures lol
FRvVFW85IcU,"Primates are the only mammals that see red. Human eyes, like chimp eyes, probably evolved to see red because of our frugivore ancestors. The reason we can see red, and see it so vividly, is because of the interplay between three types of cone cells in the retina, of which each has a pigment responsive to light from different sections of the visual spectrum: red, green, and blue. Because humans have this three-cone system, we can see more than 2.3 million gradations of color. In fact, we are so sensitive to the greens and reds in the spectrum that we can pick up colors with only one per cent variance in wavelength."
FRvVFW85IcU,"The fact that red has a longer wavelength is 100% negligible in this case. (And we don&#39;t see it first we can simply see it from further away). If a case were to be made for the color affecting the babies decision, it would be from the colors emotional impact on the infant."
FRvVFW85IcU,Tbh me too. It is crazy how we are built with morality and conscience. We basically know what is good and bad. Like it is mind blowing.
FRvVFW85IcU,LOL
FRvVFW85IcU,Pretty sure they repeated it many times with different color combinations to rule out that sort of confounding variable
FRvVFW85IcU,@Pernell13489 <br>? what? The original commenter was <b>perfectly</b><br>clear in their idea. <br>Now. What are <b>you</b> trying to talk about? 🥴🤯<br>Are you a drooling blob or what?
FRvVFW85IcU,@Pernell13489 and your point?
FRvVFW85IcU,Do you mean they should use a bunny rabbit stuffed animal instead of one that is a kitten? Because they are showing the stuffed animals doing good and bad things.
FRvVFW85IcU,Good idea
FRvVFW85IcU,@Samantha B ... they could care less about a prize they know it wont be anything thing they want
FRvVFW85IcU,Also as they grow older they become more self conscious or more sensitive to the opinion of others or appearing well to others.
FRvVFW85IcU,"but As they stated earlier, they said the coins can be traded in for a prize."
FRvVFW85IcU,I agree!!! I was wondering the same thing myself.
FRvVFW85IcU,"@Ryan Garces Do you mean &quot;should be&quot; in an idealistic, utopian sense, or in the sense that this is your best guess/hunch?"
FRvVFW85IcU,"DrGlenda Clare Good point. I don’t know specifics but there’s studies on how babies are more drawn to “attractive” people. Maybe not necessarily “attractive” because that’s subjective, but pleasant, smiling, positive, people, Which doesn’t seem like groundbreaking science if you ask me. In this case the babies are choosing the dog that slammed the thing shut, they probl. think the nice one’s a sucker. Good StreetSmarts babies."
FRvVFW85IcU,There really should be no difference between babies of different race.
FRvVFW85IcU,“Transgender children”
FRvVFW85IcU,The coins aren&#39;t valueless.  The narrator said that the children were told the coins could be traded in for prizes.
FRvVFW85IcU,@Tony Midyett it means ugly in Russian
FRvVFW85IcU,@Kitty Cat What is a &quot;femist&quot;?
FRvVFW85IcU,"I was thinkinght same thing , like how dislike crazy femist and see them as threats ..."
FRvVFW85IcU,so when you said &quot;...read how the test was done (google it)you will see how many times it was done on just one baby and the baby all ways pickt the good pupet no matter what some pickt the bad one tho&quot; you made up information? in summary... you don&#39;t know how the experiment was done and your basing all your information from this video?
FRvVFW85IcU,@Oishin Smith​ i coudnt find the published papers you can go to yale and ask them or call them😂<br><br><br>^thats acualy a good idea
FRvVFW85IcU,"But you were talking about published papers, where did you find the papers about the experiment? YouTube doesn&#39;t state all the variables, constants and experimental controls. Those would be in the published papers."
FRvVFW85IcU,"@Oishin Smith Type in youtube &quot;Paul Bloom, Yale University&quot;"
FRvVFW85IcU,@Oishin Smith Lol ther is more testing to be done i am planing ti do one my self but you cant make all people happy bicouse you cant be 100% sure in anything ever!I will try and find the paper and link it.
FRvVFW85IcU,"these are some big claims...you got evidence, i.e. data?"
FRvVFW85IcU,"Nice critique.  I hadn&#39;t even considered the puppeteers expressions.  However, I&#39;m curious to know what you mean by humans are MEANT to be good and bad.  Also, what do you mean by balance of life?"
FRvVFW85IcU,How do you know this?
FRvVFW85IcU,"Evil is a man made word mate, want proof? how would you describe Hitler?"
FRvVFW85IcU,There is no evil in the world. Evil is a religious concept and it assumes an objective standard of morality provided by a creator being that no one can prove exist.
FRvVFW85IcU,"However,we can eliminate these thoughts"
FRvVFW85IcU,Yeah but nobody cares when a black person is biased and racist towards white people.
FRvVFW85IcU,"A lot of people think babies can&#39;t experience empathy yet, but it&#39;s pretty clear that at least some of them do. I&#39;ve seen infants as young as three months smile and babble at someone who was crying, and if they didn&#39;t smile back, the baby started crying with them."
FRvVFW85IcU,Not surprising..animals also sense sadness in humans
FRvVFW85IcU,I have experienced the same.
FRvVFW85IcU,"Babies are sensitive to facial expressions, they can sense when something is wrong through it. It&#39;s one of their primal source of communication to others."
FRvVFW85IcU,"The roles were reversed for half of the babies, 50% would see the red one shutting it and 50% would see the gray one."
FRvVFW85IcU,@Shir Srur haha same
FRvVFW85IcU,@Shir Srur me too! 3:07am
FRvVFW85IcU,same
FRvVFW85IcU,Same. A whole research paper
FRvVFW85IcU,Same
FRvVFW85IcU,I think there&#39;s a good chance it&#39;s less that they know they&#39;re being tested but probably just in general want to come across that way. Less coins is worth the psychological reward of being deemed a good person.
FRvVFW85IcU,And other tests &amp; measures will test that
FRvVFW85IcU,"@Innominated Compassion is a girl thing is utter sexism. If you don&#39;t remember, Karen is popular stereotype for entitled (often racist) white &quot;women&quot;."
FRvVFW85IcU,@Rajkumar Rajappan Isn&#39;t that the whole point of what the video is trying to say? That as you get older you get more educated on what is the better thing to do. And you have a greater freedom of choice to choose/fight against your natural instinct.
FRvVFW85IcU,"Yes i thought i made it clear that we do learn many behaviours; i&#39;m sorry if it was not clear, but we are also born with the ability to do or think good or bad before we have learnt it. <br>If you you are saying that we learn everything we think and do, you are then saying that you  don&#39;t have a mind to think and make choices by yourself, unless you see or hear it from someone. <br>In short, your saying, your like a robot which needs to be programmed with information before you can even think. Really??<br><br>If you believe in the &quot;theory&quot; of evolution and you think of when the first humans or creatures that evolved; you are saying according to this &quot;theory&quot;, no creature or human could think or act until they heard or saw someone else say or do something. If this is so, this theory is self contradicting. <br><br>Can you explain this conundrum in detail please?"
FRvVFW85IcU,"If you finished watching the video, you&#39;d have known it tells you the answer in the end: through education."
FRvVFW85IcU,"I&#39;m Christian and I will give you my view. We are born sinful, yes. I don&#39;t need to teach a child how to be bad, but I need to teach them how to be good. God gives us a conscience and when we learn what is right our conscience kicks in. We just have to act on our conscience."
FRvVFW85IcU,clearly all you know about christians is from the media lmao
FRvVFW85IcU,"Even the heathens give good gifts to their children. (born evil yes, born depraved no)"
FRvVFW85IcU,holdingfirmly q
FRvVFW85IcU,"It&#39;s neither evil or wrong, it&#39;s rational biological behavior."
FRvVFW85IcU,Wrong conclusion. The experiment says babies are good. The thing that overshadows their goodness is their little biases. Babies are just like us both good and selfish.
FRvVFW85IcU,"Well.. yeah. I still remember making choices like that though, I&#39;ve always been like that (according to my memories, which go all the way back towards daycare at the local YMCA)."
FRvVFW85IcU,I bet you are already 12 years old now.
FRvVFW85IcU,Amen
FRvVFW85IcU,"Hi Matt <br>God will continue revealing his Truth to those who search for it, and as you had an open mind before you met Christ, you were able to understand the Truth of the Bible. As the Lord reveals &quot;helps you understand&quot; his Word, ask him to help you follow him or else you will stop learning and growing in the grace of God. <br>Lots of love.....God bless"
FRvVFW85IcU,Aha
FRvVFW85IcU,"The whole point of the experiments is that babies choose the nice puppets, unless they&#39;re acting mean to those they consider mean - i.e. either acting mean or being different to them. They already showed that in the first experiment."
FRvVFW85IcU,my thoughts exactly... the mean Puppets seemed to be more interesting
FRvVFW85IcU,That&#39;s not even biblical at all.
FRvVFW85IcU,"yes it looked like it, didnt it?"
FRvVFW85IcU,"Elaine, this is a study done by esteemed researchers.  You are applying a simplistic observation to a complicated phenomenon."
FRvVFW85IcU,yes only that they randomized the color and the puppets and the side they were presented on in this experiment.
FRvVFW85IcU,"+Elaine Gomez They couldn&#39;t really have same colored everything, as the baby would not know the difference."
FRvVFW85IcU,right?
FRvVFW85IcU,Our teacher had this comment on the screen while we were at school....so....
FRvVFW85IcU,+Evil_Joker like m8
FRvVFW85IcU,It&#39;s likely they switched up the puppets. It&#39;s basic experiment design.
FRvVFW85IcU,I think they should have used different colored puppies representing good and bad characters.
FRvVFW85IcU,Could the color of the stuffed animals have any affect on what the baby liked or disliked?
FRvVFW85IcU,an experiment like this does not need a control if this randomization of the conditions within the task is sufficiently high. but i guess they could have used completely unknown puppets to choose from. i dont know
FRvVFW85IcU,+Synth L you took the nurture argument pretty far with that one.
FRvVFW85IcU,"@Vanja Đukić they are color blind until the cone receptors are properly formed if memory serves correct, so around 4 months or older is when they can see in color I believe.  I could be wrong."
FRvVFW85IcU,MoonstonePearl21 1.babys are not collor blind <br>2.when you do a test you do it in every posible way
FRvVFW85IcU,@Sage L It might depend on the individual baby. I would think yes because there is still that moral code embedded in people there. 
FRvVFW85IcU,"+MoonstonePearl21 I was wondering that if a puppet liked both cheerios and graham crackers, would the baby still want him to be punished?  I feel that the answer is no, because they are actually sharing a bond."
FRvVFW85IcU,I&#39;m sure they factored that in and shuffled the colors around accordingly
FRvVFW85IcU,"What do you expect? We evolved to be tribalistic. It is your responsibility as someone who (presumably) dislikes this behavior, to provide incentive to people so that they don&#39;t."
FRvVFW85IcU,"But bias caused by shapes and colors of the toys may very well have been considered and/or controlled by their experiments, understanding that the full study isn&#39;t revealed in this 15 minutes show. If their study can be so easily debunked by us laymen, then the study itself is worthless."
FRvVFW85IcU,"because there are no biases in this experiments, Debra."
FRvVFW85IcU,+Jorge Orozco why?
FRvVFW85IcU,"@Juan Zulu in that case, you would surely just get a 50/50 split in outcome. Not 87% or whatever it was. Wayyyy too high a number to just be luck."
FRvVFW85IcU,"@Juan Zulu It&#39;s 3 years on since your comment but anyhow, I entirely Agree!!😉"
FRvVFW85IcU,Thats true most people that do these experiments are inconsistant. People no matter how smart dont really know much and we all have this ego with our intelligence so people forget these intelligent people want to be seen as intelligent above all. I dont get much info from the outside world I go within myself for answers. I know my good and only my good so I trust myself I dont know someone elses so I cant listen to them.
FRvVFW85IcU,"Here are some quotes from one of the studies that answer your concerns:<br><br>&quot;Parents were instructed to then turn their chairs 90 degrees to the right, so that they were no longer facing the puppet stage, and to close their eyes. An experimenter blind to the identity of the Opener and Closer puppets presented them to the infant.&quot;<br><br>&quot;The following were counterbalanced across infants within all conditions and in each age group: experimental condition (Social or Inanimate Control), identity of Opener (grey or orange cat), order of Opening and Closing events during habituation (Opening First or Second), side of Opener (Left or Right) during habituation, and side of Opener (Left or Right) during choice.&quot;<br><br>Link to the said study:<br><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3076932/"">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3076932/</a>"

FRvVFW85IcU,"@OhMyGodSushiRoll Maybe if he formed that opinion on his own, but I&#39;m fairly comfortable saying he didn&#39;t. He had it shoved down his throat in his youth so it imprinted on him as fact."
FRvVFW85IcU,"@AchDeToni @kellerr13 only pointed out things that may influence the results which is fair criticism. If full study shows that these things were all controlled for, then nothing more needs to be said.<br>You demeaning @kellerr13 shows your arrogance and intolerance towards others&#39; opinions."
FRvVFW85IcU,@kellerr13 I see you are experts on psychological studies. So you also should have learned that factors such as these are excluded by randomizing them in the tests.
FRvVFW85IcU,"Budder Kupp Ted Bundy Jr born in vampire Christian America,,, it&#39;s all nurture... right???"
FRvVFW85IcU,The next Ted Bundy perhaps??
FRvVFW85IcU,kellerr13 - That&#39;s true. They should mostly be identical. Maybe a small different colored circles on face or something.
FRvVFW85IcU,"@God is Love Scientists will think things through a lot more than you did your comment. Factors like these will be randomized in such tests, i.e. the grey cat will be the bad one as often as the orange one is. The result is then independent of the colors cat."
FRvVFW85IcU,@Jai Ko In studies like these  these factors are randomized. The grey cat is as often the bad one as the orange is. So the result is independant of the color cat.
FRvVFW85IcU,"It&#39;s randomized, the grey cat isn&#39;t always the good cat. But if the babies consistently pick the good cat even if it&#39;s a random color, then that shows color isn&#39;t a factor."
FRvVFW85IcU,@Bob McBobbington if theyre going to present the findings of the research then they should have addressed the study in its entirety...they didn&#39;t state that they switched the clothes up. And the lay person may not understand why that would be a poorly designed study so it should have been explained further.
FRvVFW85IcU,Yes...they need to design the study where half the babies see the actions of the puppets in reverse to rule out a preference for the color or the clothing of the puppets. It&#39;s interesting but poorly designed.
FRvVFW85IcU,Valeron Unications skinner believed that children could be taught anything as long as they are being trained. John Locke and Skinner have similar theories

FRvVFW85IcU,"Maybe I am pessimistic, but I believe that every selfless act done by humans has an element of selfishness involved. It usually is rooted in seeking material rewards, recognition, self-confidence, or could be a primal instinct to group together to become a stronger unit. Like the video said, society and parental nurturing need to intervene in order to counteract with our &quot;us versus them&quot; instinct. Selfless acts are probably the product of the intervention."
FRvVFW85IcU,"Most selfless acts happen in defense of offspring, which is essentially promoting your genes. They&#39;re the ones that need most help.<br><br>A group that has genes that would make them more likely to act selflessly and defend their offspring are more likely to continue their genes. The side effect, of course, is selflessly acting towards anyone you love/care about.<br><br>That being said, a group that has a lot of &#39;sefless&#39; genes would also be more likely to survive in general, as selfless people would sacrifice themselves for the better of the group, continuing its existence."
FRvVFW85IcU,what about when we are selfless? empathy is an instinct as well.but not for the single individual&#39;s survival but for the survival of humanity as a whole
FRvVFW85IcU,"@S Roy<br>&quot;You asked me what results I would have got. The answer is I don&#39;t know. The test is supposed to give us the answer :)&quot;<br><br>I asked you what kind of results you would get because you said:<br><br>&quot;Crazy study, will soon be proven wrong.&quot;"
FRvVFW85IcU,"@S Roy <br>I also asked you which <i>particular</i> experiment you objected to and since <i>particular</i> was the word you used, I thought perhaps you would tell me which experiment you thought was problematic.<br><br>Many experiments are shown in this video and they involve children at very different stages of development.<br><br>But if you think that Pavlov&#39;s experiments are not very good because he didn&#39;t use enough breeds of dog, that&#39;s your opinion and you&#39;re entitled to it.<br><br>Perhaps I&#39;m as biased as Karen Wynn&#39;s experiments but I used the same methods to teach my Yorkie how to sit as I used with my Pit Bull Terrier. I just always assumed a dog was a dog and that all dogs like treats.<br><br>And I got both dogs to sit on command."
FRvVFW85IcU,@Edwin Luciano A few things come to mind. They could have used<br> 1) Children from different races and different backgrounds<br>2) Chldren from multiple types of families<br>3) Multiple settings for the tests<br>4) Children from different countries<br>5) Was the sample of kids large enough?<br>You asked me what results I would have got. The answer is I don&#39;t know. The test is supposed to give us the answer :)
FRvVFW85IcU,"@S Roy &quot;Yes, there are many Selection Biases in this particular test.&quot;<br><br>Which particular test? They had a set of tests where they were testing babies with puppets, another set when they were testing young children with chips and another set still where they were testing older children chips.<br><br>The first set of tests were to see if children detected good moral behavior and whether or not they preferred puppets (and by extension people) who share a preference. The second and third was aimed at detecting how children are willing to deprive others of something of value in order to insure that others (perhaps unfairly) don&#39;t get more than they do.<br><br>I&#39;m interested in reading how you would have conducted these tests differently, what kinds of results you would get and why you would have gotten different results.<br><br>What would you tell Karen Wynn to change in her experiments?"
FRvVFW85IcU,"@Edwin Luciano Yes, there are many Selection Biases in this particular test. I do believe that the researchers in this case are biased toward a particular result. "
FRvVFW85IcU,most shortest and smartest comment on here.
FRvVFW85IcU,"@randy109<br>Your believe is according to the facts of ethical development and capabilities of social behavior within populations wrong and your feelings are wrong imprinted like someone, who hates black people for no reason, you just hate human being(s) in general for no reason.<br>End of debate. :-)"
FRvVFW85IcU,"@Angelmou I used &quot;Churches&quot; as an example of people trying to do good, not to start a religious debate!  How did my comment become a debate about religion?  My point was that people have to TRY to do good, while constantly tempted to do bad (adultery, lying, cheating, stealing).  Didn&#39;t mean to bring any religion into the discussion.  ALL churches have the &quot;being good and not evil&quot; message and all religions have their version of the Golden Rule.  Man is inherently evil and definitely NOT good.  This video is b.s. and manipulating babies is not going to convince me that man is inherently &quot;good&quot; because we definitely are NOT... "
FRvVFW85IcU,"@EagleZtoTheGrave<br>Yes one reason why trinity has become major part of western christianities, but not in the East, that is why in Islam Jesus is only prophet.<br>Political interests were a big problem the jewish origins had also to fight and loose. A reason why the stories of the old testament are basically falsification of history by nobles of several schools. ;-)"
FRvVFW85IcU,"@Angelmou There were churches in Rome before political agendas began taking place (tied to christianity at least). The government realized they couldn&#39;t stop it from spreading and infiltrated the movement. Just because something gets exploited, doesn&#39;t negate its intended use. Ignorant people with twisted ideals, religious or not are the problem. "
FRvVFW85IcU,What nonsense. Churches were not in India or Japan nor in the time of the vikings nor in the stone ages and so on.<br>Churches exist because of political lies and mythology enforced by the sword like Islam by the saber.
FRvVFW85IcU,"And if they did so what? Put them to work In a occupation or position where their qualities(or traits, features, attributes, characteristics,etc....)Can be put to &quot;good&quot; use......."
FRvVFW85IcU,@angelsintahoe In that case they failed horribly because all they shown is that babies can recognize aggressive movements.
FRvVFW85IcU,It appears you oversimplified the study&#39;s goal.  The research was to determine if babies are able to distinguish some sense of morality.  NOT if the baby was good or bad...
FRvVFW85IcU,The video said that they&#39;re in the Nature science journal
FRvVFW85IcU,Search the names of the authors in google scholar
FRvVFW85IcU,Thank you. You saved me a lot of typing.
FRvVFW85IcU,"John Abad Yeah—listen to a guy in the YouTube comments, or rely on the actual experts in the field of early childhood psychology at Yale who’ve been peer reviewed (their methodology has been critiqued by other experts)? Quack, you haven’t got a chance!"
FRvVFW85IcU,"These are all valid comments, but, as Michelle said, the video is a demonstration for the purpose of the TV show, not a recording from the original experiment, so it doesn&#39;t make sense to draw conclusions about the study from the behaviour in the video. However, we have reports of the original studies to see what confounding variables were controlled.<br><br>Here are some quotes from one of the studies that answer your concerns:<br><br>&quot;Parents were instructed to then turn their chairs 90 degrees to the right, so that they were no longer facing the puppet stage, and to close their eyes. An experimenter blind to the identity of the Opener and Closer puppets presented them to the infant.&quot;<br><br>&quot;The following were counterbalanced across infants within all conditions and in each age group: experimental condition (Social or Inanimate Control), identity of Opener (grey or orange cat), order of Opening and Closing events during habituation (Opening First or Second), side of Opener (Left or Right) during habituation, and side of Opener (Left or Right) during choice.&quot;<br><br>Link to the said study:<br><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3076932/"">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3076932/</a>"
FRvVFW85IcU,"The researchers are well aware of the possibility that they are biasing the results, however, they are not.  This is a peer reviewed study with landmark findings."
FRvVFW85IcU,This has been done professionally by actual researchers over and over. It is true.
FRvVFW85IcU,Babies that young don&#39;t have much of a hand preference yet.
FRvVFW85IcU,"I&#39;m just a few minutes in, and all the &quot;good&quot; puppets are to the babies&#39; right-hand sides, so I wondered that too. But surely they randomized for which side, what color shirt, whether the &quot;good&quot; puppet appeared on the left or right in doing the skit performance and whether that puppet was offered on the same or opposite side in the choosing stage, etc. It would be poor design otherwise ..."
FRvVFW85IcU,Babies dont really have a preference as far as I can tell
FRvVFW85IcU,"I get the impression that they also performed the puppet show slightly differently when they were testing for bigotry. They seemed to make the helpful one look more violent as he opened the lid, and the one trying to open the box seemed to pop off of it in a less aggressive manner when the unhelpful one closed the lid."
FRvVFW85IcU,@Mimi Ramone indeed!
FRvVFW85IcU,"@W <b>YES</b> Perfectly stated, thank you!"
FRvVFW85IcU,Precisely.
FRvVFW85IcU,...which we consider being good
FRvVFW85IcU,From an utilitarian standpoint*
FRvVFW85IcU,@David that&#39;s was a joke.
FRvVFW85IcU,@Kareem Davis bro Europeans ...morality? Through out history? Are you fr? Or you are joking. ?
FRvVFW85IcU,@Mimi Ramone mine too 💙
FRvVFW85IcU,Uirai Deszen Like me. Choosing my boyfriends LOL. My picker is broken.
FRvVFW85IcU,@Kareem Davis 😂
FRvVFW85IcU,There&#39;s this disturbing tendency to only label the emotional side of morality morality. Yet thinking and reason are important as well. Without them we wouldn&#39;t be able to ever get over emotional moralities that don&#39;t serve any purpose or make any sense. For instance homophobes would never be able to learn to accept homosexuals. We&#39;d probably still insist that women on their periods have to be cast out of the town for a period of time. It&#39;s good we can use reason to adjust morality or everyone would be forever just stuck in their ways and unable to get along.
FRvVFW85IcU,Hence it can&#39;t properly be called &quot;morality&quot;. Morality involves understanding of things as right or wrong not reactions of which you haven&#39;t come to understand as having meaning yet.
FRvVFW85IcU,they may have but didn&#39;t get shown
FRvVFW85IcU,"@wormez1 Race shouldn&#39;t be an issue, but it would scatter the results if color blind babies were used, mainly because the puppets were silent because using a &quot;mean&quot; or &quot;good&quot; voice would also give the babies a bias. More or less."
FRvVFW85IcU,"or left handed would more likely grab the left one, and what about color blind babies?"
FRvVFW85IcU,"Oh, pu-LEEEESE."
FRvVFW85IcU,Not all people maybe u and yours are
FRvVFW85IcU,Aha
FRvVFW85IcU,Those are the exact same three things <b>I</b> learned from this video. 😯

This harm that the right has caused, which is if anything only self harm… vs nationwide masking of all kids/remote learning which has shown a lot of societal problems such as increases in suicides, speech issues, anxiety, etc. These problems are not remotely even closely similar and this is just on one of the hills the left had decided to die on."

aI1KU5rsThI,Doctors have a thing against vitamins when was the last time you heard a doctor ask “how much sunlight are you getting?
aI1KU5rsThI,Exactly
aI1KU5rsThI,@MrDobberdude There have been studies with Zinc? Vitamin D? And HCQ and Quercetin?  Is that what you&#39;re saying?
aI1KU5rsThI,HCQ and Quercetin yes
aI1KU5rsThI,"@Rich Vid Great, but is there even one study that looked at either IVM, HCQ or Quercetin in conjunction with Zinc and/or Vitamin D/Vitamin C, etc.?

aI1KU5rsThI,"Critics of mask mandates have cited the lack of relevant randomized clinical trials, which assign participants at random to either a control group or an intervention group.

wMSiSSJWFww,That&#39;s normal most babies do not like to lay on their tummies <br>Hold ur baby tummy area and roam around that will calm the baby down if shes crying becoz of tummy issues
wMSiSSJWFww,Thanks for this

VrQhmcPrhFw,iPad kids…
VrQhmcPrhFw,@Fahm_Azmii If a grown adult can get addicted and glued to this device imagine the damage it does to a child whose brain is not even fully developed? I wouldn&#39;t let my children play with these devices until age 6-7.
VrQhmcPrhFw,@froggy chair more like froggy chair amirite chat it is that bad. I’m a server so I see it a lot ! You try and interact with the kids and they can’t cause they’re glued to the screen. Also I’ve had a family come in and complain that their 5 year old is already have neck problems and they’re seeking a resolution
VrQhmcPrhFw,@froggy chair more like froggy chair amirite chat uhm I hate looking at my phone when I&#39;m going out with my parents and I see this 4+ years old looking at their ipads like they are getting an award

VrQhmcPrhFw,How about you go but one and google how to spell.
VrQhmcPrhFw,The T.v is an angel compared to Tablets and Smart phones. T.V could only be done at home and most times kids would just watch their favorite programs then go off to do something else. You can take tablets and smart phones anywhere now and it can keep them busy for an infinite amount of time.

VrQhmcPrhFw,Just get your kid an Amazon tablet their cheap and you can restrict it I have one and I use it a lot even though I do have a phone
VrQhmcPrhFw,I didn’t have a phone till I was 11  too
VrQhmcPrhFw,I don&#39;t have a phone until I&#39;m 11
VrQhmcPrhFw,Nexity DM I didn’t have one till I was about 8 or 9 I had ds before tho
VrQhmcPrhFw,I know how to keep myself from getting addicted
VrQhmcPrhFw,"Same, I wish my parents didn&#39;t get me a laptop (They had to because it was compulsory for school) or a phone. I would be fit and active constantly playing outside having fun. I wish the addiction wasn&#39;t there, but I have to go on my laptop for sometimes hours every day because of school. Even if what I&#39;m doing on there isn&#39;t &#39;fun&#39; it still fuels the addiction. I&#39;m only good at writing essays/persuasive texts in school because I&#39;ve had so much experience arguing with people in comment sections. I would download software to help this addiction, but I have to go on it FOR DARN SCHOOL. If school became less technology based and parents set limits to screen time I believe 100% kids will be less addicted."

VrQhmcPrhFw,Aaaaaand that failed
VrQhmcPrhFw,"@s71402san I mean, theoretically everyone is healthier when they aren&#39;t addicted to anything. For children, being addicted to their tablets <b>is</b> harmful or unhealthy, yes."
VrQhmcPrhFw,@Gillian Gaines So children are at most healthy when they aren&#39;t addicted to anything?
VrQhmcPrhFw,"iPads and tablets in particular tend to be more addictive for children and individuals than &quot;old fashioned&quot; entertainment. You&#39;re also not learning social skills which is extremely important for developing children. I have a laundry list of reasons why not to give children, especially very young children, these technologies, but if you&#39;re really interested you&#39;ll research it yourself."

VrQhmcPrhFw,lkjhb1  your joking right ( r/woooosh ?? )
VrQhmcPrhFw,"what a load of bullshit, Ipads are not teh problem it&#39;s called Balance which parents have to provide, my 1 year old goes on the ipad but he also plays with toys crawls around opening draw etc the usual Toddler stuff. it&#39;s all miss leading this Ipad is not development crap, its about balance"
VrQhmcPrhFw,TheBookWorm1718  I disagree  there are some Apple apps  that can improve the child brains
VrQhmcPrhFw,"I think it&#39;s partly caused by parents not paying attention to their children and not staying calm in all situations.  Obviously not all, but I thought my 17 month old son was showing signs of autism, so I started spending even more time playing with him and interacting him with way more and his &quot;symptoms&quot; slowly faded and everything I was worried about went away and he began growing and changing a lot faster.  I started letting him play with the tablet at 19 months old and it&#39;s amazing how much he has learned from it.  I think they are great as long as you are right next to him playing the tablet with him and giving time limits on screen time so they don&#39;t start acting like zombies.  As I watched this video i saw them trying to talk to the children while they were playing the tablets, well they are busy!! Who stops everything they are doing when someone interrupts them?  Sometimes I think these studies are a little much and they are aren&#39;t accurate at all."
VrQhmcPrhFw,I think scientist shouldnt make ipads and tablets they should make toys isntead  well rather play wid my toys now hah

VrQhmcPrhFw,I don&#39;t
VrQhmcPrhFw,"Nowadays, having tech at 12 is a little late. I was exposed a few years before that age.. about 10 years old I think. There were constant yelling in the home and it was a great way for me to escape. I do have anxiety, though personally I dont think it was because of the iPad as I had shown signs earlier. I suppose everyone&#39;s story is different."
VrQhmcPrhFw,Tech did not cause your disorder. You&#39;ve probably had it since day one but only noticed recently.
VrQhmcPrhFw,I have been using the computer since I was 3. Have been playing video games since then as well. I&#39;m OK. My social skills IMPROVED because of it. My writing skills IMPROVED. My logic and problem solving skills have IMPROVED.
VrQhmcPrhFw,I don&#39;t think social anxiety disorder is caused by tech I think it just develops stronger when you go through puberty
VrQhmcPrhFw,Ever heard of open world sandbox games?
VrQhmcPrhFw,Those so called good days had higher crime rates than today. Part of the reason crime has dropped is because of tech as kids don&#39;t need to be outside for interactive entertainment.

VrQhmcPrhFw,26 year old kid. What?
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,She&#39;s bothering the cat that&#39;s not precious
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,I have necis and my cat is obbsed with them
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,ikr
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,​@Julia c <br>So can cats and other humans...<br>The likelihood that a dog will deliberately harm a child in its own household is near zero. A cat that feels anoyed is quite prone to lash out.
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,Dogs can literally kill small children
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,You got that right 👍 Always and forever 😊😊😊
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,@Darcy var Attre regardless some cats are just like that I’ve only had bad experiences with cats and I never liked them so I would avoid them and they would scratch me . But she’s a toddler she doesn’t know
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,"As I know, cats do that if toddlers anoy them, especially pulling their tails and stuff like that. When I was around 3 or something like that, I was an annoying brat, who chased around my granny&#39;s cat. Then I tried to pick her up by her tail and got a big ass scratch. It was my fault tho"
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,"You shouldn&#39;t own pets then, plain and simple"
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,Then don&#39;t get a cat lol
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,Yeah I don’t understand why they can’t teach the kid to leave Stella alone?
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,some cats are not*
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,Some cats are just not used to being around younger children.
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,"I’m a kid and I’ve owned cats my whole life. I’ve never treated a cat like this. It’s really the parents. The parents are honestly being dumb. You have to teach your kid the cats boundaries and show them that they need space. The toddler was in the cats face, and they blamed the cat? Messed up! I agree with you though!"
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,"I don&#39;t think it&#39;s that, it&#39;s the chaotic, unpredictable energetics of a child."
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,@caitolent ugh its annoying. everytime someone brings their child to our house they keep screaming at my bird to get her to talk or shake her cage. i have to shut them down every 2 minutes
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,yes they are lol
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,They need to defend themselves somehow
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,weird side of reddit thanks for providing me with no evidence that nikki sixx has assaulted drunk women. it means a lot.
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,weird side of reddit stop accusing me of shit you don’t know. where is your proof that nikki sixx has assaulted drunk women?
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,not the girl with the nikki sixx pfp. you realize he isn’t a saint right? he called his body guard the n word and has assaulted drunk women
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,o wow your so edgy owahh! SO CooOolll
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,Why? It just being a baby plus no one get rib of they kid bc of they cat
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,Dang that was supposed to be &quot;whose&quot; not &quot;who&#39;s&quot;.
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,"Thomas Plouffe, well sorry but I hate cats, my babysitters cat attacked me for no reason when I was three leaving me with scaring over my right eyelid and face until I was six, that cat hated me for no reason but loved ever other kid it came in contact with, I also was attacked by another cat years later and my grandmothers cat also hated me hissing and scratching yet I never even touched them, never invaded there space and never touch there things so"
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,You&#39;re right! lol
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,You are right. In the end it is the parent&#39;s fault
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,Hits child
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,you wanna explain that to a 15 month old?
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,"Also Avery seems to understand the messages from the cat. No hitting back,no screaming."
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,No
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,Wolf Kitten I love those chirps!
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,"@Shiva sh who are you to tell me if im fit or not? by that same logic, youre unfit to have children if you let your animals clash with them and do nothing."
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,You are unfit to own a cat then
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,You are unfit to be a cat owner then
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,Talk to the tail
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,"@nhv kuy I&#39;m not looking thru these again from a yr ago, but there were many comments about how they should throw the kid away and keep the cat, or saying they needed to give the kid away so 🤷‍♀️"
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,I don&#39;t see any hate on the kid just poking some fun at parents
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,I thought I was the only one who felt that way
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,"@Beegee yea because some people are just plain stupid. if you learn and educate your child, then there is nothing wrong.<br><br>my child is 2, and treat our cat with a lot of respect. why? because we thaught herto be gentle to animals"
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,Mrs Gamer you fixed nothing. You just made it worse. I guess thats why we see more children in foster care.
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,"id get rid of the child if my cat scratches the kid.<br><br>there, fixed it for you.  <br><br>and, if your cat scratches your kid, YOU are doing something wrong. not the cat."
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,It&#39;s hilarious 😂
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,"DUEDD, HE DOES. <br><br>(or like a GTA character after being customized. <br>(like Michael, Trevor, or Franklin after you bring them to the hair dresser) )"
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,no
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,"uhhh that aint true. they may be more likely due to abuse but black csts are just like any other cat. stella was being SUPER POLITE in this video to the kid. the slap was her telling the kid to gently back off or she&#39;d defend herself, because she felt threatened."
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,then the cat would just start using it&#39;s claws and teeth.instead of giving a pat with no claws.<br><br><br>cause cats don&#39;t understand punishment.
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,if your baby owes comes first.then don&#39;t let them pester a animal till the animal feels the need to give a warning. separate them when the animal gets annoyed.<br><br><br>since you&#39;re the adult that knows fully what&#39;s going on and can choose to remove the baby from the situation.
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,but you can expect the parents to separate the 2 when the child is annoying the animal to the point the animal feel the need to give warning.<br><br><br>also imagination using the same excuse of a toddler just being a toddler for other situations where the parent should step in.&quot;oh my kids just very energetic so I&#39;ll let them run into the middle of the street into traffic&quot; &quot;oh I&#39;ll just let my kid touch a hot stove cause they just want to touch it&quot;
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,Brianna Harter your actually talking rubbish and I’m not adult so can u move x
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,"if your kids safety is important then why not.I don&#39;t try teaching them to not constantly harass animals just like how you teach them other basic safety rules like not running into the street and not touching hot things.<br><br><br><br><br>removing a animal cause you can&#39;t be bothered to stop your toddler from harassing <a href=""http://them.is/"">them.is</a> like removing the stove cause you can&#39;t be bothered to prevent them from touching the hot <a href=""http://stove.it/"">stove.it</a> just shows you lack very important parenting skills."
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,Cynthia Kila’ black cats are the worst
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,"Well, I&#39;m sure they didn&#39;t want to have to throw their cat in a shelter.. At least they sought out help, they didn&#39;t just ignore the problem..."
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,That&#39;s right.  I would get rid of the cat.  My child comes first.   This couple is really selfish.
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,Get rid of Eather mom or dad

ZsPx4XVgU_Y,Emma Ansel that’s not even funny if your expecting laughs. It’s honestly a bit mean.
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,Agree.
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,"While they might exaggerate the misbehavior it&#39;s absolutely good that they nipped this in the bud instead of waiting for the problem to escalate, especially since there&#39;s the actually unpredictable toddler in the equation that they&#39;re understandably going to be protective of."
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,"Hey, they asked for help because they didn&#39;t know what to do.  They deserve credit for asking for help instead of getting rid of Stella."
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,Some dog or cat owners are clueless about their own pets 🤦‍♀️
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,@Shirin preach
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,"True, true, but it makes sense. Humans are emotional, not logical. We must always be mindful of this fact when making decisions. No one is immune."
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,Accurate af!
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,Wow!
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,this comment made me ugly laugh 💀

ZsPx4XVgU_Y,Better yet get rid of the damn cat.
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,It’s weird 😐😑
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,My kitten acts more like a dog since she grew up with cats and dogs.
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,Lol I do that when I’m fuming too as a human
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,I think that’s a dog...
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,"Technically, that&#39;s what a b*tchslap is. ;-)<br>A slap with a cupped hand makes a lot of noise without as much impact.

ZsPx4XVgU_Y,Same
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,Lol 😂

ZsPx4XVgU_Y,You do
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,No he is against that. Check his other videos and books

ZsPx4XVgU_Y,@Retro Gamer that’s called taking care of your kids
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,"@Retro Gamer And when you say treating toddlers like a god, it’s called being a parent."
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,@Retro Gamer Dude same can be said about cats. They’re not living Egyptian times where cats are above humans
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,@sunarin You don’t have kids do you? And you treat cats as gods do you?
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,@Alina Same could be said about their pets.😒

ZsPx4XVgU_Y,I&#39;m sorry about the passing of your beloved pet. Can you tell us more about your experience?
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,"still, looking up &#39;why is my cat wagging its tail&#39; shows &#39;hey, its pissed. back off&#39;<br>they get the kid away when shes pissed, that would have solved it. this cat is an angel compared to some other cats that have genuine,problems on this show."
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,How the shows are presented: ^<br><br>What the shows are in reality: How to train parents/guardians
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,Animal Planet: How to train humans

ZsPx4XVgU_Y,And the world&#39;s strictest parents: how to raise grateful teenagers!
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,"live4marilyn, nah this ain’t it chief, Victoria Stilwell."
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,"@Lexie Luff shyness is normal in cats, its personalities. she&#39;s being invaded and giving the child soft pats to tell her to leave. she is communicating so well and no one is listening to her, poor thing!"
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,"Actually, the cat is pretty shy! Dealing with a toddler is hard work lol"
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,I mean they already were in the clip. They told the toddler &quot;come over here&quot; when it swiped at her. It just takes awhile for it to &quot;click&quot; in small children. They&#39;re still learning cause and effect at this stage.
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,@ ꧁𝓢𝓮𝓻𝓮𝓷𝓲𝓽𝔂 ̊ೃ𝓜𝓸𝓸𝓷• ੭꧂ They can but they can also end up in a situation like this. Where the animal is harassed by the child because their parents refuse to teach them how to behave around it or supervise them.
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,Zero Effort not true. Many dogs love babies and have no problem being around them. They love to interact and play together. Many are also very protective of children especially against strangers.
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,@Captain Pike-a-chu Kind of why children and pets don&#39;t mix.
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,"That is a 13 month old baby, I don’t know if you spend a lot of time around babies but they don’t get it. This one barely even talks at this age much less understand what to do with cats. When the kid gets older and is capable of proper communication and understanding, yes, teach the kid to respect the cat and their boundaries, but right now, there’s no way that baby understands that she’s not suppose to interact with the cat in a certain way and even if the parents try to teach her, it’s not gonna be understood"
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,It is funny. When a cat keeps it&#39;s claws retracted a paw is just a soft fuzzy pad. A soft bop is a gentle lesson. The cat was trying to teach the kid because the parents wouldn&#39;t.
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,I love your username 🤣
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,"@softvie more so stimulated, which can be &quot;agitation&quot; or &quot;interested in play&quot;"
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,Lmao😂😂😂
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,Please don&#39;t ever breed seeing as you clearly can&#39;t even handle a cat.
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,"Less problems, for sure, and no college to save up for.  And you can go out when you want, and do things on the spur of the moment.  Kids sure are lifestyle killers.  That&#39;s why we didn&#39;t have any, but we do have cats and dogs."
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,"Douglas Griffiths — Did I say what he could or couldn’t do with his body? No. <br><br>Seems arrogant to me, though. We’re each unique without extra adornment."
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,"It&#39;s his body, and he can do what he wants.  There are more modified people than not, myself and wife included, and proud of it.  It&#39;s prudish to see people that way."
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,@Echo Thundor  she didn&#39;t use claws. . cats cant talk and say &quot;please leave me alone&quot; so that&#39;s how they tell you that without hurting you. The owners said she scratches them but never drew blood on the kid. which means she is a very intelligent cat that knows the child doesn&#39;t know better and is she just trying to communicate to the kid that she wants to be left alone without causing harm. . . animals are smarter than people think. They just cant tell us how they are feeling so its our job as good owners to understand them better.
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,@Cryptic Alter not to mention the adults were biten and clawed breaking skin .
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,@Cryptic Alter well on the face and maybe other times it might be worser who knows . Parents fault mostly .

ZsPx4XVgU_Y,AHHAH
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,"​@no Cat or dog, a pet is NOT a toy to amuse your kids...<br>Teach your kids to respect your pets and there won&#39;t be any problem…<br>In that show the parents clearly said the cat never scratched their daugther… A few soft paws swats to teach the toddler some manners because obviously the parents are too stupid to do it themselves…<br>I grew up with cats… They would even cuddle with me at night… Our parents were very clear, don&#39;t annoy the cats, be gentle with them, respect their bounderies… If we were caught annoying the cats we would be scolded..."
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,@Douglas Griffiths More dogs have killed adults than children. Also dogs have better temperament than cats. Dogs can be trained to remain calm around kids. Dogs usually have an instinct to protect their families especially children. If a child hit a cat or got in it&#39;s face and poked and prodded it it would scratch. Dogs are usually not like that and if they are can be trained not to do that. Good day.
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,"Dogs can turn on a child as well, and do much more damage, especially if it&#39;s a bigger dog.  Dogs have killed kids, you know."
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,That&#39;s just pets in general.
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,You have a really wise and thoughtful mother!
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,"@Millie R. being two is absolutely no excuse.<br><br>I was raised from birth with cats, you know what the first thing i learned was, even before potty training? Boundaries, I learned to respect the boundaries of my cat. I learned to back off if my cats ears went back or if they swished their tail. That way, I never once got hurt by my cats.<br><br>Boundaries are easy to teach and learn, especially to a young child."
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,You were probably older than 2 😂
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,Your Mom&#39;s smart. ^^
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,Kirby Brown wow I feel so bad about your roommate&#39;s cat.

ZsPx4XVgU_Y,@Xhabir Isaku nah
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,Black and white cats are way more beautiful than just black cats.
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,"All cats are dignified. But yes, black ones are extra beautiful"
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,"true, but the parents shouldn&#39;t be calling the cat unpredictable when looking up what she&#39;s doing gives &#39;hey shes pent up and angry people are near her&#39;"

ZsPx4XVgU_Y,@dead account lol Almost 2 k likes... should I be scared?
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,crotch goblins
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,Not true at all....cats can be cuddly and very good with kids
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,"Bullshit.  They do just fine together, as long as the needs of both are met adequately.  My wife&#39;s parents had cats before they had her, and never had any problems. Don&#39;t think dogs won&#39;t be a problem with kids--dogs have killed babies out of jealousy."
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,@Lauren South That&#39;s how you were when you were little.
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,She won&#39;t be if she doesn&#39;t leave Stella alone. My husband&#39;s grandchild kept pestering  my cat when all of us (including my cat) told her to leave him alone. 20 years later she still has the bite mark on her cheek. Respect the cat&#39;s space!
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,@Pavor Nocturnus ok thanks for the advice^^
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,"Do you play with your cat? Does she have enough space to hide? It&#39;s mostly anxiety. Talk calm to her, let her sniff your hand before you cuddle her. Don&#39;t be offensive."
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,"The worst ones I&#39;ve seen on the show have health issues that make them lash out. Like they&#39;re half blind, in pain from a health issue, or have a bowel problem."
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,"@Ling They&#39;re a lot of reasons for people to get the two (I know I would because it&#39;s what I&#39;m used to), but you need to know when it&#39;s not going to be okay in that case"
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,I actually thought that was kinda cute in its own way the cat didn’t claw into her just a light slap with no claws
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,@Tine R it’s puzzling because they’re different species that honestly should not interact- and I don’t understand why anyone with a cat would suddenly get a dog. Also kind of weird to me that you keep referring to the dog as “the puppy” and “it” every time when you refer to the cat with an actual pronoun.
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,Very true
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,@miss true semen The cat is not even mean.
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,"latonya ingram yes true but the child isn’t even two, maybe 1.5? She doesn’t listen at this age but explaining how to act wouldn’t hurt, of course. <br><br>And they’re new parents so they’re learning just like the baby and cat are. People are vicious about the kid being misbehaved somehow though which makes no sense to me. This child is no brat, she’s a baby."
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,I have seen that movie too
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,​@Fritz Monorail I have quite a few male BFFs who are actually sexy af wearing both earrings. But some do not fit that range. Lol
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,It&#39;s nice to know that you feel that it&#39;s your right to police what people should be allowed to wear based on their gender.Plenty of guys wear earrings you know it&#39;s not like he&#39;s wearing six-inch heels and a dress.
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,Agree!!!
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,i&#39;ll give the parents credit for moving the toddler chair though..
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,@Meagen I call cats love of my life the most beautiful thing in the world and babies spawns of satan and creatures of the void. I love cats way more than babies.
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,🤣🤣🤣
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,@Meagen animals are living things to not objects
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,That&#39;s me.
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,@Rushi I love children! They are so precious!!!
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,@Lukasz Kowalczyk  he expects it to survive outside. He doesnt want it inside and he shot the last cat that was on our property. This kitten can barley tolerate 60° and its raining like hell. With that being said I highly doubt hes gonna take this kitten to the vet. His dog hasn&#39;t been to one in years. Idk what tp do for this poor kitten
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,That&#39;s what people need to do before adopting any pet.  Kudos for being an excellent pet parent.
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,Nathan omg I thought the same ! <br>Animals first!
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,Yep
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,Oof
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,@Vanikerch i&#39;m speaking generally. i was also raised with pet cats without issue.
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,"My older sister, my younger sister, and I were raised from infancy with cats; 0 issue? You have to teach kids to read cat language cues, which is hard when you don&#39;t understand them yourself (looking at you, 90% of My Cat From Hell owners). I was actually the type of kid to fill in words for feeling discomfort I didn&#39;t know with HISSING, and I can easily fool the rest of my family with my unique cat &quot;voice&quot; I developed through regularly interacting with at least 2 dozen cats over the course of my life. When properly raising a kid with cats, it often becomes easier for them to talk to cats than other humans."
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,Wait... no I just remembered a time I wasn’t... so nvm
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,@Subzerofrom NY its true. I was timid around animals so I was very careful around them
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,@Blueberryymuffin yeah sure you were
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,"@Romantic OutlawHard way to learn a lesson, eh?"
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,"@zorbathegreek I hate to be That Person, but we had a cat when I was a kid. I drove it to the point of scratching me, and then I left it the hell alone because it had knives for hands. Basic stimulus based learning"
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,"Point is, unlike adults, kids don&#39;t know when to leave a cat alone----until it&#39;s too late, that is, i.e., when the cat&#39;s patience has snapped, and it&#39;s bit and clawed the kid bad(which was fortunately prevented, in this case)."
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,"@MaBeef   cats use different behaviors to show different stuff. Like dogs push their jaw slightly up to warn others to stay away from them.<br>Stella, flicked her tail strongly, when a cat does it, it means you should leave it alone. another problem the toddler did is to look at the cat directly in their eyes,for cats, this shows they have competition for their place in the house. This wasn&#39;t a claw or a scratch. It was a soft paw hit, which is really,not painful.<br>From a cat owner myself, the soft paw is really not painful."
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,"@MaBeef this isn&#39;t the fault of the cat, the owners cant see the signals"
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,@MaBeef wtf Stella is so cute wym
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,Well if you want you&#39;re eye poked out then buy it somehow
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,They&#39;re laughing until it happens to their kids
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,@Mehitabel super dramatic lol
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,"@FlyingMonkies325 my kitty girl Grace is four and a half months old, and acts JUST like Miss Stella, and your assumption and prediction in my case with an identical situation is 100% accurate she did not come from the most loving home. I have a three year old daughter Ava who just wants to love her kitty Grace up. We are working on it. Things are getting better slowly but surely :) Trust is a must with any feline, and it is very hard to earn it in cats and very easy to lose."
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,"For some of the slow people in the comments, it&#39;s neither the baby or the cats fault on how they choose to behave. Anywayz, Stella understands that Avery is just a baby so she is way more gentle with her than with the parents even though they all equally agitate her."
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,Right she knows not to actually hurt the baby
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,Its never Cats fault.
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,Cats aren&#39;t bad. People are.
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,Your name says it all lol
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,"@Victoria it&#39;s not up to a 2/3 year old, it&#39;s up to the parents, geez, but maybe that is why we don&#39;t need to contact Jackson,maybe Jackson looks for the obvious and we watch it."
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,"they&#39;re not abusing the cat, they&#39;re not neglecting the cat, they were just ignorant and a bit clueless with the cat which they worked on and I hope are continuing to work on. What does the pointless judgement serve?"
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,Yeah my cat just pushes my head away when she’s had enough
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,@IThinkILeftMyCatInTheToaster LOL yes true
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,@IThinkILeftMyCatInTheToaster he never said that it was this todlers fault. he said that parents should teach that becus thers 10 year olds who still dont know that
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,when they got panicked i was like “???” she was just telling the kid to stay away GENTLY lmfao
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,"Me too, especially the lil yelp xD"
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,@N H true they are quirky
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,Me too !🤣🤣
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,Same here 😂
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,@N H nobody is saying that lol
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,and you think cats can’t stress kids out? it works both ways you don’t expect a toddler to know if they arent being taught that its wrong to pull the cats tail? babies are learning to interact with objects around them and they view animals as a learning experience how they interact with them is not ill intentioned as you all may think. stop demonizing a literal child shes not even 3.
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,Right and kids pull their tails and poke the animal<br>You can tell when an animal like a cat or dog is stressed by the tail. Every parent should know this 🤦🏻‍♀️
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,🤔 who woulda thunk it
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,@Subzerofrom NY seriously.   A cat is still a liveing breathing creature.  A parent should teach their children how to interact with a pet properly.    A cat only hurt a child after being pulled on and hurt itself.   Yes any parent would be out of their mind angry if their child was hurt by a cat but it&#39;s still not the cats fault.   If someone is going to have pets in their home they have to teach their children on how to treat them.  A real cat is not a stuffed cat.  You still have to treat it with care like you would a person.  You can&#39;t pull on and hurt it.    And if the child&#39;s to young to learn yet you shouldn&#39;t have pets in the home
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,Its obvious that you never had kids or just hate them in general
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,@Letitia Jackson kid: <b>kills cat</b> it was an addent
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,"One time a kid pulled a cats tail, tail could not .over no more"
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,"Totally agree. I don&#39;t understand why some people equate ignorance with evil intent, or something incurable. I have always been a cat person, but I made many mistakes with my first cat before I learned how to read her and got some good advice. <br><br>And some people are not cat people at all. They don&#39;t get their behavior or body language at all, or they try to treat them like dogs or as children... My husband didn&#39;t know anything about cats when we started dating, he tried to punish my cat if she did something &quot;wrong&quot; like pooped on the carpet. Now he knows it&#39;s not the cats fault, accidents happen or maybe she had a hair in her system. Now, he&#39;s amazing with OUR little angel 💖<br><br>But I guess if you ask these toxic, judgemental people online, cat police should&#39;ve broken in and taken our cat away because <b>gasp</b> we weren&#39;t perfect cat owners from the beginning."
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,It’s like REAL parenting 😂
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,@Lt. Basil well that&#39;s what everybody said and ur blaming me for what
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,​@Artzilla That&#39;s not fair. The kid is a <b>toddler.</b> You can&#39;t expect someone that young to know better.
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,"you can have a cat and a toddler if you do it responsibly, like by letting the cat have an escape where it isn&#39;t forced into conflict with the child all the time. Blows my mind when people with a cat and either dogs or kids don&#39;t have high spaces that are cat-only"
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,"@couch_philosoph abandoning animals is really bad lmao I wouldn&#39;t adopt one beforehand ovbiously, not being an animal lover doesn&#39;t mean to be a bitch to them, even if many people are sadly 😔"
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,"@Yuri Miura i think its really good that you make this decision beforehand :) . Different lifestyles work for different people. Sadly, some people get a cat just because and after like 2 years they get a kid and abandon the cat. Even having an outdoor cat would be much better. I think its great that you made your decision"
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,@couch_philosoph my point was that knowing that I have a little kid I would never adopt a cat. I&#39;m not an animal lover myself so I would absolutely keep them separated
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,"You should rather keep toddler and cat seperate . Most cats dont want to fight; they want their safe space away from grabby hands. Just give cats towers or something where the toddler cant go and try to teach your child that they need to be gentle with animals. I grew up with animals and honestly, every time i got a scratch i deserved it because i was being stupid. It made me way more mindful of other people and beings and their needs. However, if you know that you cant handle it, please think before getting a cat. Most cats who end up in shelters will not go into a loving home, because all people want are kittens and they dont adopt enough adult cats. If you givr away your adult cat you are also feeding this problem"
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,These people could be in church every day of the week for all you know. What the hell are you talking about?
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,"WakingOHIOMama 91 &quot;I have raised 3 toddlers to released into the wild&quot; that made me laugh so hard, thanks for brightening my day!"
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,"Yes lol. The toddler however is very unpredictable!  I have raised 3 toddlers to release into the wild,  and the older they got the better they were able to get along with our cats lol."
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,@Tilly Too exactlyyy and they wonder why 🙄
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,@Nihilist at least a child can&#39;t hurt you like a cat can I remember my grandparents cats. They had 2 and one was 4 and one was 6 had them both since kittens and the 6 year old was as calm as anything the 4 year old however was completely different in the sense that it wouldn&#39;t attack anyone not even the next doors kids who they babysat every other week which was bizzare as they would pull at her tail hard and push her over and such but hated me with a passion although I never touched her except to try and get her off me. I would avoid her wherever and whenever possible especially since I&#39;m allergic to cat fur and she would either run up behind me and claw and bite the back of my legs when I was going to the bathroom or on the occasions where my grandad would put her on the arm of the sofa next to me reassuring that she was fine she would scratch at my neck hard.<br>Cat behaviourist told them that my family couldn&#39;t visit them for as long as they had the cat since I was the only person it would attack. I&#39;m now covered with scars that I&#39;m insecure about and don&#39;t go near animals anymore as I don&#39;t want another attack (I was at the ages of 4-9 when this was happening)
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,"@Renee Boston what the hell man. Thats way too far, you cant say “you should’ve got rid of the baby.” Why the fuck would you want to get rid of your child rather than a house held pet"
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,@Pegi M and OP is referring to what the parents are saying- not Jackson.
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,@Pine Forest sadly
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,Most people don’t understand that cats have warning signs cause they are so use to direct messages and warning. A cat does not understand nor care  lol
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,Chrysaura and cats he helps the cats as well!
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,@Aesthetic.Exe-Any type of vids you guys want! Maybe she had previous owner that played tough with her before? Or maybe she sees your legs are toys? You can gently tell her not to attack your legs
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,Dude you have your own life and pets to worry about than going around deciding which owners are considered worthless.
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,"@Henry Tuttle That’s really over simplifying what I said. Sure you can get toys and a bed for a cat, but when lots of people interact with a cat like they would a dog and get stumped when the cat doesn’t respond as they expected - because they expected wrong or didn’t know what to expect. People are not born with the knowledge of how to properly care for any animal, you need to learn and sometimes people make mistakes."
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,It makes me so angry. HOW CAN YOU GET AN ANIMAL AND DO NO RESEARCH AT ALL?!
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,"I always tell my parents that if they want my kitty to not destroy their sofa, she needs a scratching post! But they think is unecessary, same with toys, but i&#39;m the one who is taking care of her in that topic, i already gave her a lot of toys, and one relative give her toys too. And I play a lot with her too. I&#39;m thinking buying a scratching post on internet or when quarantine is done and safe to go outside, lol"
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,"yeah, and that kid would be staying with its parents and not me if that was my cat 😂"
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,"adult people are fine, but I&#39;d take a quiet cat over a howling screeching sticky messy pinching hitting toddler any day of the week"
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,She&#39;s a baby. 🤦🏿‍♀️🤦🏿‍♀️🤦🏿‍♀️
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,"As they get older but for now the toddler wont understand shit, as well she has to do certain things that are part of her development.  So no, the cat should be trained to ignore, move away from the toddler&#39;s behavior and or be placed elsewhere while the child gets older."
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,"Stryker J you can’t expect a 13 month old toddler who can’t even speak, to understand that."
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,@Hermaeus Mora yaaaas queen
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,@Joanna Ch nah
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,"Just kidding not nice hearing that from side huh, it should be the same for the toddler.<br>Anyway the owners/parents are the problem its always them. They need to play with their cat more,learn to read her body language, a have her space be in one place so she doesn&#39;t feel invaded all the time. The cat and be a cat.<br>With that the toddler will be able to be a toddler without getting any harm in her home."
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,"The whole cat should be thrown away instead since shes harder to predict and is stubborn, shrugs"
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,Nice bait
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,Agree completely!!!
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,"Yes, xoxo exactly ! Xoxo"
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,Hahahahaha
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,Monopoly man + the villian in Alvin chipmunks
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,I agree
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,"I don&#39;t let my cats be on tables and counters because that&#39;s where I eat and make food. Other than that, they can be on most surfaces."
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,"@M36Games or just search up, cat misses owner or cat cries when owner leaves on youtube and dozens of heartbreaking videos will show up showing their emotions."
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,"​@M36Games Cats can be impeccably affectionate, perceptive and thoughtful...yes, I said thoughtful! One of my cats had once figured out that I liked to eat G&amp;B&#39;s sea salt chocolate while on my period. The lovely little fucker then hoarded the blue wrappers of the chocolate bar in some corner of the house and always gave them to me when I&#39;d sulk and crouch due to cramps. He not only figured out that periods make me miserable but also what makes me happy, eventhough he himself gagged whenever he smelt chocolate...My current cat can always tell when I&#39;m having a depressive episode or a flashback (I have ptsd). He literally follows me around everywhere (which he usually never does) when I&#39;m having a depressive phase, as if he can tell that I&#39;m a danger to myself during those moments. And when I&#39;m having a flashback he&#39;ll knead some part of my body or jump on me continuously and YELL HIS FUCKING HEAD OFF; as if he somehow realises that I&#39;m caught in a nightmarish trance and need to be snapped back to reality. Cats don&#39;t love you just because you&#39;re there. You need to earn their trust, attention, love, care and devotion. They are sensitive and remember things. They haven&#39;t been genetically manipulated to being eager to please and obey commands like dogs. They love because they CHOOSE to..And no 2 cats are the same, there are proper feral cats who would never acclimatise to humans and some are more shy and reserved, some are lazy, some tear the house down...Anyway, it does sound like your sister doesn&#39;t take proper responsibility of the cat as it bothers you so much, also, I think the cat knows you don&#39;t like it and they are naturally curious..I guess just talk to your sister and try to have a little more patience..oh and check out this playlist which shows how loving and caring cats can be. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDGZo_9JWWO58_zn5BCxdyxrRAoul-TFJ"">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDGZo_9JWWO58_zn5BCxdyxrRAoul-TFJ</a>"
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,"@Heedy Oh I accept that it isn&#39;t a cuddly play thing that does what I want. That being said, I don&#39;t want it in my house. I honestly don&#39;t understand the appeal of cats other than they visually look cute."
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,exactly i hate when people put animals over humans. It’s  weird she’s a baby of course she shouldnt hurt the cat but its not het intention to so the parents need to teach her not to and pay attention to both
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,"Not every child has the same copy and paste personality. Just like different cats have different energy levels so do children. Maybe the kid is just lazy. You had to practically scrap me off the couch. Once you placed me somewhere, I never moved."
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,I rarely moved unless someone made me
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,"@Giorno Giovanna they were just joking, you&#39;re overreacting"
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,Lol
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,Idkkk Name hi
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,PockyThief차 노아 hi
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,Same 😂😭😂
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,Reply to me when your done lol I wanna know it&#39;s says
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,"Black cats make me kind of sad because a few years ago my grandparents cat, Sooty, died. She was about 20 years old, the same age as my sister, and they&#39;d had her since she was a kitten when my mum and sister found her on my grandparents doorstep. I will always remember about a year before she died, when my grandparents moved for the first time since she&#39;d been with them and the new house has a sliding glass door, which the old house didn&#39;t have. My grandma was in the kitchen (where the door was) and heard a small thunk and realised Sooty had walked into the door. We bought a butterfly sticker to put on the door at her height so she could see whether the door was open since the one already on the door was at human level."
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,David J legends
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,@Hi There amen

ZsPx4XVgU_Y,MidKnight Blue 🙄
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,Nina Cepero-Fernandez <br><br>Like this emoji 😳
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,"You do NOT want a pet to attack a kid&#39;s face- obviously it&#39;s understandable from the cat&#39;s perspective, but kids can get blinded so much more often from being closer to a pet&#39;s level. This is why you need to be very careful with toddlers and pets!"
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,His face when Avery is in Stella&#39;s face too
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,Lel
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,until you get hit back
ZsPx4XVgU_Y,@Daki Ume yes me did <br>:3

v6n9snBQTic,Is Rotogenflux Methods useful to increase your IQ score over 17 points? We have learn a lot of good stuff about this intelligence boost system.
v6n9snBQTic,What are some ways to increase your IQ of 22 points? I read a lot of great opinions on the internet about how Rotogenflux Methods will help you increase your IQ score over 15 points. Has anybody tested out this intelligence boost system?
v6n9snBQTic,"Okay, but many people don&#39;t actually get it,...we still have got innocent minds here"
v6n9snBQTic,Lmaooo
v6n9snBQTic,🤔
v6n9snBQTic,I didn&#39;t get your comment bro

v6n9snBQTic,Excuses.
v6n9snBQTic,Totally had me in the first part 😅
v6n9snBQTic,Yo dont worry your not the only one
v6n9snBQTic,"i believe opening yourself to new learnings, skills and knowledge will expand your knowing over all. say you want to know more about the mind, spend time going out there to look for people, groups and events thats are all about the mind... the more you learns and discover.... there further your intelligence builds. This can go for all fields"
v6n9snBQTic,mornings are great time to have your mind and body set up ready for the day. though it can be done other times of the day too... however mornings set you up for a greater focused day
v6n9snBQTic,She&#39;s very pretty
v6n9snBQTic,Push up
v6n9snBQTic,P.s . I usually eat it or vape it
v6n9snBQTic,A doctor once told me that exercising after eating is unhealthy.
v6n9snBQTic,Wow   Definitely worked
v6n9snBQTic,Random dancing or popular dancing?
v6n9snBQTic,"@Dominic Millan Welcome, I&#39;m glad to help!"

v6n9snBQTic,@Dominic Millan Good Will Hunting.
v6n9snBQTic,What movie is that thumb nail?
v6n9snBQTic,@Adam M self dabba
v6n9snBQTic,"First of all, she was talking about light exercises, second, just because the body is tired doesn&#39;t mean the brain is, and lastly, she said that you can get benefits from exercising in the evening too."
v6n9snBQTic,"based on experience, you actually feel better for the rest of the day compare to when not doing morning exercise. start slowly and do short distance, then increase the distance as your body get used to it."
v6n9snBQTic,Biaute Music boi
v6n9snBQTic,0OoH FaX
v6n9snBQTic,"But when you exercise, that good feeing is provided by your whole body and your whole mind working better, which means that your brain improves it&#39;s biological functions and capacities"
v6n9snBQTic,"Actually, exercise over time does make you a genius per se. There is scientific evidence unrelated to this video out there."
v6n9snBQTic,Did she say genius?  Did I miss something?
v6n9snBQTic,Maybe meditation
v6n9snBQTic,Disgusting

v6n9snBQTic,"Wow, I run 30 minutes and I&#39;m good. 48 years is mind boggling."
v6n9snBQTic,"@starvin marvin are you overweight? Your style of running also might&#39;ve done you in. You&#39;re supposed to bounce up and down. Some people do not, and those kinds of people damage their knees.  Your knees are designed to bend. Exerting pressure with it straightened out will damage it."
v6n9snBQTic,it gives a little boost when u study
v6n9snBQTic,Ever hear of head trauma?
v6n9snBQTic,Concussions
v6n9snBQTic,Maybe they aren&#39;t as dumb as you think.  Perhaps you aren&#39;t being receptive.
v6n9snBQTic,Think about it another way: they would be dumber without exercise.
v6n9snBQTic,"Okay, so how much money were you paid to advertise this?"

v6n9snBQTic,"@picric no one noticed that he turned the theory around, except you ;)"
v6n9snBQTic,"einstein was built different, no seriously, his brain was 15 % wider than most and was missing a sulcus that divided temporal and parietal lobes. Must&#39;ve helped maybe idk"
v6n9snBQTic,"He was actually a born genius than a guy who worked harder and became a genius.<br>There are many bad unknown and underlying facts about Einstein, If you don&#39;t know. I think people tell you good things about Einstein because you don&#39;t do anything, that&#39;s why they tell you to be like him."
v6n9snBQTic,I think doing strenth exercise increases oxygen level demand in body ... An to compensate this.. Body takes lots of oxygen.. And brain neural tissues gets more oxygen.. This can be a possible analogue for this.. 😅

3-A9SgbAK5I,Please do!
3-A9SgbAK5I,@ProfKelley Thank you very much sir
3-A9SgbAK5I,"Scheme and schema are the same - some use the word scheme and others schema.  A scheme differs from a concept in that it can include a procedure or specific sequence for how an event would typically unfold.  &quot;Dog&quot; is both a schema and a concept (e.g., typically has four legs, barks, is furry, doesn&#39;t climb trees, etc.). Yet your schema also would include what to expect to occur when you get home from work, when your dog again sees you are home.  Schemas help people to anticipate and best respond to situations similar to those previously encountered; they also help by reducing cognitive load and making it easier to pay attention to what is novel."
3-A9SgbAK5I,Piaget may be &#39;outdated&#39; but most new research stems from him findings.
3-A9SgbAK5I,So would it be 100% Piaget if a parent wouldnt have been mentioned?
5XFjLdNO4FU,I was thinking the same
5XFjLdNO4FU,What Irish accent
5XFjLdNO4FU,"Perhaps she isn’t getting attention at home, if she gets attention at school she might realise she doesn’t need to act out to get that attention"
5XFjLdNO4FU,Attention isn’t a bad thing
5XFjLdNO4FU,With that personality I feel even more sorry for you
5XFjLdNO4FU,No it doesn’t
5XFjLdNO4FU,They have behaviour issues
5XFjLdNO4FU,They’re not
5XFjLdNO4FU,"There was a boy at my school who got suspended so much. He&#39;d be there for a week, suspended for a week and so on. Suspension keeps kids at home where the problems lie."
5XFjLdNO4FU,"Remember the word positive in that sense doesn’t correlate at all with positivity, rather the adding of something to increase behavior. You can add chores to a list so the child starts cleaning, and keep adding them until they start. That is positive reinforcement."
5XFjLdNO4FU,I wish...
5XFjLdNO4FU,You’d be surprised. I’ve encountered tons of hyperactive ADHD females.
5XFjLdNO4FU,It&#39;s 2 months late but maybe not too late: „Clair de lune“by Debussy
5XFjLdNO4FU,@Nikki Cas Ikr?! It&#39;s called &quot;weather&quot;.  Just wear weather appropriate attire. Lol🤦
5XFjLdNO4FU,"Yes!!! You don’t how many time parents would walk into the class and ask with a nasty attitude, “Are they going outside? It’s snowing.” I would tell them in parent orientation please dress them appropriately because we will go outside during light snow and rain, thank you lol"
5XFjLdNO4FU,jordan had ADHD but I’m not sure about the other ones
5XFjLdNO4FU,"That.&#39;s why sh e  waved her hand in front of his face to see if he blinked , and he did  ."
5XFjLdNO4FU,@Nope @KARMAround
5XFjLdNO4FU,@Kirstin1977 1 hour 15 mins in
5XFjLdNO4FU,"@Daisy H I cried when that happened! It shows just how much love and support these teachers not only have for their students, but also the student&#39;s parents."
5XFjLdNO4FU,Silly certificate or certificate of achievement?
5XFjLdNO4FU,"@Steph Elle oooh wow I see... Here in Spain we don&#39;t have those rules, teachers are usually pretty close to students so a familiar ambient is created.<br>I&#39;ve also seen is really bad seen calling the teachers by their names and let me tell you, that was super surprising to me.. Hahaha <br>But to be honest, I think is more elegant to call the teachers by their surname, even though that creates a feeling of distance."
5XFjLdNO4FU,@Isabel Rodriguez It depends on the state or school district but in my state it’s not allowed unless the child initiates the hug and it’s in a public space like the hallway
5XFjLdNO4FU,What do you mean by allowed? Aren&#39;t they allowed to do so normally?
5XFjLdNO4FU,"His Mum told the film crew that Jason and his brother went into care ., whilst she went into rehab , which  was very brave of her to admit"
5XFjLdNO4FU,I’m autistic and I see some aspects of myself in Jamie too.
5XFjLdNO4FU,Same here. I hate people who thinks that stuff is not real and kids are just brats. The reason why ADHD and ADD exist because humans were hunters and gathers first and far long then as farmers. Humans move around a lot. It&#39;s not these people fault that humans decided to become farmers. I don&#39;t see ADHD and ADD as something abnormal
5XFjLdNO4FU,"Yes, in Glasgow :)"
5XFjLdNO4FU,"Should also add, this documentary inspire me to train for the job I do now, because these women are incredible and if I&#39;m half the professional they are I&#39;ll consider it a success"
5XFjLdNO4FU,"And, then, @ <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XFjLdNO4FU&amp;t=22m45s"">22:45</a> she does not badger the girl--but employs the same tactic I just mentioned...  Is a feminist still the opposite of a male misogynist? No, wait... Misandrist, she may be."
5XFjLdNO4FU,"wow, as I continue watching, I am realizing how much I was like Jordan :("
5XFjLdNO4FU,K Earl so sad. Plus his Mom admitted she lost her children for awhile due to being an alcoholic. :(
5XFjLdNO4FU,Fizzie Lizzie Bath Bombs She said footballer lol it’s just the Scottish accent
5XFjLdNO4FU,Defiently something to help these poorly understood kids
5XFjLdNO4FU,Its like a safehaven for those kids who are of school age but have not emotionally grown into their own.  They have help along the way.  I wish they had a program to help carry these principles home to their parents and help them all recover or grow and change their circumstances for the better
5XFjLdNO4FU,They&#39;re scottish
5XFjLdNO4FU,possibly but he also could have copied it  from something at home  just  a thought
5XFjLdNO4FU,"wow, i love ur story. thank u for sharing! I bet u would make a wonderful teacher urself and that u are a great mother<br>sorry for all u went through <br>u are an overcomer"
5XFjLdNO4FU,Watch the whole film. The all have VERY good endings. :)
5XFjLdNO4FU,Scottish.  Sounds like Glaswegian to me.
5XFjLdNO4FU,"Támara Hill, MS NCC CCTP LPC yes. 👍🏻"
5XFjLdNO4FU,satsumamoon iii
5XFjLdNO4FU,"I know what you mean.  It&#39;s like a &#39;one size fits all&#39; regimen for the less docile kids.  They need somebody to actually be interested in what they think.  This is all about learning to perform in accordance with a program.  It&#39;s like, &quot;One Flew Over The Cuckoo&#39;s Nest&quot;.  <br><br>It&#39;s not the teacher&#39;s fault.  They&#39;re taught that there is a particular way to manage the social problem of turbulent domestic life, manifesting in public situations, and it&#39;s all about suppression.  And they are hampered by limited resources and depleted staffing.  These children are like whirring wheels.  They don&#39;t need brakes as much as they need functioning cogs."
5XFjLdNO4FU,"Same goes for me. I am dual sensory, vision and hearing impaired. In the 1980s, there were so-called, special Schools or institution Schools for the blind, where we had to live away from home 5 days a week. I wasn&#39;t nurtured anything like the princess or angel I was dubbed by my family at home. I felt every teacher just saw me as an inconvenience and instead of being helped or instructed in the fashion to which I was accustomed I was penalised, timed out, left out of trips and other activities which the people in my class or house units took part in most weeks because they completed piecesof work without needing help or extra direction with this.  was also rather too hyperactive and overactive at night when everyone  including myself, was supposed to be in bed and asleep. I have a blown circadian rhythm or 24-hour body clock cycle, which sometimes still affects me to this day age 37. I was carted off to a different room to sleep the rest of the night if I was caught out of bed and out of bounds, this, after a lengthy timeout in a corner of the kitchen diner. Same applied throughout the School day. I was frogmarched out of class and timed out on the other side of the door, in the cantine over lunchtimes, at lunchtimes, for barely, putting a fingernail out of line. So flipping strict, for want of much stronger f words, so, if my children are born with my condition and sensory issues, they would never, attend School like I had to attend School, even if those Schools weren&#39;t closed down and turned into wedding venues or retirement pads. I couldn&#39;t do that to them."
5XFjLdNO4FU,Yep
5XFjLdNO4FU,"yes, spot-on"
5XFjLdNO4FU,Tina Bean will said !
5XFjLdNO4FU,jon bloe I do see a point in this. Because since that with that example I try to bring my little Brothers school to make such a room in there school :&gt;
5XFjLdNO4FU,"The teacher is really good. <br>I think children who have a difficulty behavior should have special class for them .<br>If they stay in the normal class,  it is will be very difficult  for teacher and may be harm other children and get all attention from teacher so it is not fair for other children. Children allway need someone to care about them not only the child have difficult  behavior.<br>I think it is also responsible  of family. The family need to find the way to educate thier children and talk will teach or professional  people to find the best way for him instead  put him to several  school . I think most of school and teacher are good but they do not have enough  time for him because they have many children need thier help. His parents  should responsibility  about their child."
5XFjLdNO4FU,Good teachers are underpaid and underappreciated while bad teachers are overpaid and shouldn&#39;t be teaching. Teachers unions protect poor teachers at the cost of good ones.
5XFjLdNO4FU,Depends on where.
5XFjLdNO4FU,Lol it depends a lot
5XFjLdNO4FU,Teachers are  bad they are ok with the abuse they do for a job.
5XFjLdNO4FU,Northern Witch what does that mean if you don&#39;t mind me asking?
5XFjLdNO4FU,DK Dempcey Knight DK lmao. We all have different gifts 😊
5XFjLdNO4FU,MiamiPush2theLimit I agree. The basics only. But we spend whole lifetimes being schooled in the whitemans world but human beings are so much more than this in our own spiritually. Its all a system thats been put together to enslave us &amp; to only benieft the elites. If only people got in contact with their spiritual side more to understand were so much more than just trained ants to serve only a white mans purpose. we waste whole lifetimes &amp; for what? I say open your eyes people &amp; stop thinking the white mans way is the ONLY way.
5XFjLdNO4FU,"Amanda Pattel learning the basics are a human right. Every human in this world must know how to read and write and develop their minds  it&#39;s math and science. After that, they can choose what they want to do with their lives. But it is in society&#39;s best interest to have an educated public."
5XFjLdNO4FU,"Dear Lord. Teachers are great, but when did children become so pampered? My friends boarded from 5 or 6 and bad behaviour just wasnt tolerated. Also had friends who were are at bernados and thrived"
5XFjLdNO4FU,(Wealthy) American schools are well funded. Schools are funded by taxes.
5XFjLdNO4FU,"idk which America you&#39;re living in, but schools here can be quite underfunded. i wouldn&#39;t say they use much tech either, except at the high school level or in certain very wealthy districts"
5XFjLdNO4FU,Jasmine Nicole we spend more money on school system than most countries.
5XFjLdNO4FU,missmeltyface American schools are very poorly funded. The government only spends 3% of our tax dollars on education. Please do better research
5XFjLdNO4FU,First put Hillary in
5XFjLdNO4FU,Danny Boyo the neuter room
5XFjLdNO4FU,"Danny Boyo Can we not bring up politics on a documentary that is completely unrelated to any kind of political issue. It&#39;s not even based in America, for fucks sake, let&#39;s keep some things pure. Some of us come to places like this to not think about things for a few moments."
5XFjLdNO4FU,You mean ‘nurture’?  🙄
5XFjLdNO4FU,I came from an abusive home and more than one too.
5XFjLdNO4FU,Shelby Perkins still all the talk of death and jail and dead bodies...
5XFjLdNO4FU,nevermind. his mother was a recovering alcoholic.  i spoke too soon
5XFjLdNO4FU,"If I was a kid pretending to be drunk I don&#39;t think I&#39;d be crawling on the ground like that, that&#39;s what he&#39;s seen forsure"
5XFjLdNO4FU,@Parrot Lover- oh no that’s terrible sorry to hear that 😔😔
5XFjLdNO4FU,"@Victoria Teague Actually during his mom’s interview she said she used to be an alcoholic and at one point lost her kids... Thats probably where he got it from and why it effects him so much, even though she is Alcohol free now. Growing up in that environment can be really challenging for kids and shape their behavior a lot."
5XFjLdNO4FU,Try some compassion for people that are suffering
5XFjLdNO4FU,Hey chill man. You&#39;re acting just like the aggresive kids on the video😂
5XFjLdNO4FU,"Jules Michael oh yeah because you know everything about their lives and what they&#39;ve been through, it actually could be a combination of disorders and it&#39;s very clear to see that things are bad at home like when the little boy was pretending to be &quot;drunk&quot; and also Jason with that aggressive behaviour and anger that&#39;s not natural and it&#39;s coming from somewhere "
5XFjLdNO4FU,Hhhhhhbb
5XFjLdNO4FU,Hearts Love you are not supposed to move someone during the siezure.
5XFjLdNO4FU,it*
5XFjLdNO4FU,"No she is not, if is easy to say because of Jason&#39;s reaction to some things"
5XFjLdNO4FU,".... No, parents should be 98% responsible for well behaved children, not teachers/the school system. These teachers are above and beyond."
5XFjLdNO4FU,And also less mental health problems
5XFjLdNO4FU,"@Derek W. You&#39;re correct, the percentage I use is a guess because I&#39;m unable to find much long term information on the success of treatment. If you&#39;ve got evidence I&#39;m unaware of, I&#39;d love to see it. Treatment depends on each person&#39;s particular situation, their willingness to participate in treatment and the severity of symptoms."
5XFjLdNO4FU,"@Derek W. I don&#39;t see much of a point in debating the cause, regardless of that they both tend to produce dangerous people. Psychopaths tend to be more manipulative, can be seen by others as more charming, lead a semblance of a normal life, and minimize risk in criminal activities. Sociopaths tend to be more erratic, rage-prone, and unable to lead as much of a normal life.  I&#39;m well aware of the nature vs nurture argument, maybe I didn&#39;t phrase what I said perfectly but it&#39;s based on the idea that both are incurable forms of mental illness."
5XFjLdNO4FU,"What do the parents do though. <br>Seems like she is raising them for 6 hours a day, 5 days a week."
5XFjLdNO4FU,"Marie Shuck some of these children have ADHD or show signs of it so talking fast keeps them from getting distracted for others they&#39;d respond to short snappy instructions instead of having a slow lecture, she&#39;s a perfectly good teacher"
5XFjLdNO4FU,.
5XFjLdNO4FU,My brother has epilepsy I&#39;ve been this many times over the years. He&#39;s 71 now.
5XFjLdNO4FU,Wendy Tedder I thought that too I didn&#39;t think it was just looking for attention because he was gasping for air
5XFjLdNO4FU,"@Lauren Evenden I wouldn&#39;t say it&#39;s common for kids to pretend to be drunk, but it definitely does happen. Especially if you have older siblings. I remember being about 10, and stumbling around the sidewalk with my six or seven year old brother, with us leaning and falling on each other and laughing and saying &quot;Yoou Make me feeeel drunk!&quot; Because I&#39;ve seen it when my older brother was watching The Simpsons 😂 but in cases like this, it likely does come from seeing it at home. We do, however, need to acknowledge that not all Behavior comes from a toxic household. I think it&#39;s all too common in society to see kids doing something like that and To just assume that their parents are abusive or neglectful."
5XFjLdNO4FU,"@Joy Parrish Did you actually pay attention and watch the entire video? It seems unlikely. They interviewed Jason&#39;s mother and she clearly said that she used to be an alcoholic, although now she is sober and worked hard to get her boys back.  Ppl that make comments on videos but don&#39;t watch or pay attention should refrain from having an opinion. SMH"
5XFjLdNO4FU,"@Joy Parrish  Well, he did. His mom used to be an alcoholic."
5XFjLdNO4FU,The fact he was digging graves and exsumed the body !!
5XFjLdNO4FU,"Kudos to the teacher that recognized the mom&#39;s &quot;need&quot; for recognition. In the USA, many kids get a trophy or award just for showing up or participating in an activity...no need to be &quot;the best&quot; or to work hard for it. I don&#39;t agree with that. However, we can go the opposite direction and never acknowledge anyone for anything, including when a person is working hard every day to achieve a goal. Most people like being appreciated or receiving acknowledgment for doing their best and it is a great thing to be a person that can be supportive of others. I think it gave this mom a boost to get the certificate and hopefully she will be a better mom and be more nurturing to her kids in the future.  The teachers in this documentary are amazing!!"
5XFjLdNO4FU,"Carol Gage it was a couple of years in total,  by the school was tough then the needle work teacher disliked Cuddy-whiffters (left handers) and if you were doing embroidery she would stab me in the top of my left hand when she caught me.  The minute she said Do not put your needles down! put your hands on the desk  I knew what was coming.  I was left with a scar on the back of my hand.  Now I can use both hands for just about everything.  My Dad&#39;s sister taught me to bake at 9 I could bake anything, we were making a Dundee fruit cake for Xmas with almonds on the top. Her cake was in the same oven as mine when it came out she said it was hers, until I said &#39;sorry Miss that&#39;s mine, it&#39;s in my Auntie&#39;s  tin.  I felt like I got her back.  I had a specially nice teacher almost every year, I became teacher&#39;s pet in the end, class monitor, Prefect and Vice Captain of &#39;Farndale House&#39;.  Funnily enough my Hubby courted &#39;Farndale House&#39; Captain <br>For about 3years after they split up months later I met him was engaged inside 5 months aged 18 and married exactly a year later.   We have been married 47 years in July, unfortunately I have had Breast Cancer,Gall bladder  with two cancers removed and 18 months ago was given seven days to live when they found out I had a rare Cancer climbing up inside of my Spinal cord.  They operated on the 5th day when I came too days later I was paralysed from the Chest down.  Just seem to be getting used to the idea of where it&#39;s left me.  I was the 3rd known one with this form of Cancer.  My hubby has not been well for about 2 months, lost a stone in weight and M.R.I and Camera down have found a large Ulcer or Cancer in his stomach.  We were given a home nurses card before we left the Specialists office on Friday and they rang back to say there had been a meeting re new patients and we are about too meet the surgeon on Wednesday at 2 pm, so I am guessing it&#39;s not an Ulcer. He is so scared I told him if I could trade places with him I would.  Isn&#39;t life awful sometimes,   Anyway thank you for bringing nice memories of my Dad back to me. I wish you good health and Happiness for you and your family God Bless and Goodbye."
5XFjLdNO4FU,"😕 Aw. That must have been a tough year for you. I hope that later in your schooling, you were put with teachers who gave you a chance before judging. Sounds like my quip pulled up a memory for you. <br><br>In today&#39;s classroom, even putting your hand on a child&#39;s&#39; shoulder saying &quot;Good job&quot; is too much touching. And either our teachers&#39; behaviors in today&#39;s world would be supremely reprimanded! <br><br>Best to you!"
5XFjLdNO4FU,"Carol Gage I was  six, with two older brothers who were 7years older at this time  (13) and 10years older  (17) obviously when I moved up a class I had to stand up and give my name to the new Teacher.  I said my name and the teacher said Do you have older brothers.  I said yes Sir, Stanley and Colin.  He went quiet and stared at me then said &#39;Sit&#39;.  He made my life Hell from that day, I was caned mainly on the back of my calves, underneath my knee length socks, a number of times on top of my skirt. Now looking back it was always at least twice a week but never where it showed.   The blackboard wiper at that time was layers of felt with a wooden grip at the side wooden holder, where the felt blocks slid in.  And he was an excellent shot.  I was sat at my desk doing sums, which I loved doing when the wooden part hit me, for no reason. One day he hit me so hard on my shins that I ran out of the class, the gate, and all the way home sobbing. My dad was the only one in, I loved  my dad and he loved me, only daughter syndrome. He cleaned my leg and and cut where the stick had split my skin. Daddy washed my face and walked me back to school.  I showed him where the teachers room was and we went in.  He first showed the Teacher my leg then asked me to sit at my desk and bring all my books out of my desk because he wanted to see my sum books and marks.  My Dad then turned and walked back to the teacher grabbing him by the front of his collar and sliding him up the wall until his feet were off the floor and held him there for what seemed a long time. I have never seen my dad&#39;s face so red and angry.  He said the next time you pick on my daughter for no reason I promise you, I will be back and you won&#39;t get 5 canings, you will get many things worse. &#39;Do You Understand&#39; .  The teacher nodded Yes.  He then told the teacher to write on the blackboard I am a bully to my little students and sign each line, and continue on paper if he ran out of board, and not stop until my father returned with me. The teacher was off for 2 periods after our class.  We then went and showed the Head, my leg, and 5 sum books with excellent results but remarks like, does not try hard enough, could do better etc., yet 9 out of 10 were the results throughout.  The Head said she would see him in 2 hours time, I was given the afternoon off to be pampered by my Dad and a surprise Milk Shake on the way home.  I still have visions about him doing his lines for all his free time.  I can laugh now."
5XFjLdNO4FU,Your Ego jame might reform. Hes not a bad person. But he needs help
5XFjLdNO4FU,K Kelly 9
5XFjLdNO4FU,"Jojo Sings, I don’t know you or your daughter.  But I can see in your comment your love and concern for your daughter.  None of us is THE ideal mom.  No one has all the answers. But you are obviously making careful, thoughtful decisions.  I think your emotional reaction to this video shows how deeply invested you are in your daughter’s welfare.  Children’s behavior isn’t necessarily a result of their genetics or of their upbringing.  And their behavior isn’t necessarily indicative of how much they are loved by their mom.  Your daughter is very lucky to go to this school, and VERY fortunate to have a mom like you!"
5XFjLdNO4FU,The fact that your child is in the nurture room is no reflection on you as a parent.<br>I know from personal experience that some kids need a little extra support than what a traditional school can provide.<br>I for example can&#39;t learn in the environment where there is lots of people.<br>I prefer more of an individual tutor type format.<br>Everyone can learn.<br>It&#39;s just a matter of finding what works best for the student.<br>Don&#39;t give up.
5XFjLdNO4FU,"Please finish the film if you haven&#39;t. You&#39;ve made some k nee-jerk assumptions. In fact, your avoidance and insecurity may be indicative of what your daughter experiences too. No matter what, they go over some of the <b>many reasons</b> for the excellent program....and the outcomes are tremendously wonderful! :)"
5XFjLdNO4FU,"I can tell by the way you&#39;re talking about your child that you seem to be doing a good job, my son is also in a nurture room and they&#39;re not all about bad behaviour, he suffers with anxiety and social skills and is being assessed for autism, I&#39;m sure it&#39;s nothing you&#39;ve done wrong and I hope you know you&#39;re definitely doing what&#39;s best for your child!"
5XFjLdNO4FU,"Same as you, but I could get through it all.  My child is nearing the end of her need for the nurture room.  She has come on in leaps and bounds.  She simply was not ready for school, emotionally.  I find myself questioning, am I a bad mum too.  Especially when you see comments like, take their kids away from them, bad parenting bla bla.  <br><br>We should never have to defend ourselves, some people are just way too judgmental for their own good.  It&#39;s ok though.  Karma&#39;s a bitch, and shows up when you least expect it and will get these judgmental people in her own time ;)"
5XFjLdNO4FU,"Amen , they just had it hard in someway or another in their young life , it’s heartbreaking so MENY little ones are born and not loved , cared for , enough , disaplented in a loving way , there dammed from the beginning of there innocent pure life as a baby ,"
5XFjLdNO4FU,"Kids screaming and shouting, usually learn it from somewhere. That somewhere is usually the home."
5XFjLdNO4FU,Marisa LearningCoach I was just saying some accents sound similar and I’m from Scotland and have been to Ireland multiple times so I obviously know that and Scotland have many different accents too like I’m from Glasgow and someone from Aberdeen will sound different from me so do not tell me to “travel more” when I was just trying to help someone understand it
5XFjLdNO4FU,EnderGuardian44 because Scottish and Irish accents sound similar
5XFjLdNO4FU,It looks like an absence seizure.
5XFjLdNO4FU,You don&#39;t blink during absence seizures
5XFjLdNO4FU,I wouldn&#39;t rule out that he could have had a seizure. It&#39;s not always obvious to parents or care givers if there&#39;s something extra going on when there are behavior problems that get all the attention.
5XFjLdNO4FU,"He’s very obviously doing it on purpose. They wouldn’t leave it out of the documentary, surely, if he’d had a noticeable medical issue."
5XFjLdNO4FU,"No, he was totally acting out. There was no history of seizure and, as the film shows, he ended up doing beautifully and the problems disappeared with help from the Nurture Room. :)"
5XFjLdNO4FU,in case u didnt notice these kids have learning difficulties which means their brains dont work in the same way as the average person e.g ad hd which affects a childs concentration they cant help tht they hav these difficulties an givin them beatings certainly wudnt stop their behavior issues cos wat they did 60 yrs ago was physical and psychological  abuse leading them to learn nothing but hav trust issues being aggressive and angry will not help a child behave been patient and assertive will. also im glad u wud never do a job like this as clearly u hav no clear understanding of kids in general if they act out there&#39;s always an underlying reason like neglect and abuse u have no clue wat they cud have experienced. so dont make flippant comments like tht cos i tell u wat half the pple tht became serial killers was becos of their environment an how they were brought up others its mental illness
5XFjLdNO4FU,Megan Scarborough That actually make sense
5XFjLdNO4FU,completely agree
5XFjLdNO4FU,ok totally take that back after watching til the end!
5XFjLdNO4FU,"Lost it emotionally?  We all should have that reaction.  That mom needed the hug, as well.  School should not be a learning experience for children but for parents and teachers, too."
5XFjLdNO4FU,"I felt so sorry for her. Poor woman, definitely never had any achievement in her life and this little one means so much to her. She is try so hard to be a good mom, and she is."
5XFjLdNO4FU,Barbara Burton Yes but some children have psychological issues that suspending them won&#39;t solve
5XFjLdNO4FU,The girl Joryden ? She was in trouble for attempted murder. I wonder after watching this what went wrong after this??
5XFjLdNO4FU,Cassie D LOL
5XFjLdNO4FU,New studies show that people with lower IQ may get caught easier due to disorganised thinking and people with a higher IQ may commit just as many crimes but get away with it more due to organised thinking.
5XFjLdNO4FU,Mag Nificent yep!!!!
5XFjLdNO4FU,generic username What did she go to jail for?? Lol I know I&#39;m a year late but I&#39;m curious
5XFjLdNO4FU,SurferGirl well I&#39;m not sure about Jordyn since she&#39;s older than me but my friend (who cameos in this lol) says she may be in jail right now. Jamie is in my school he&#39;s quiet now I&#39;d say defo not like he was in this
5XFjLdNO4FU,"generic username Yea, what happened to some of them?"
5XFjLdNO4FU,generic username how are they doing now?
5XFjLdNO4FU,Tell me about it
5XFjLdNO4FU,You are 20 now. What are you doing with your life?
5XFjLdNO4FU,"If you want to really open your mind try reading Donald Hoffman and Bernardo Kastrup. Very mind opening and amazing, even for well read adults."
5XFjLdNO4FU,"@Handsoap I was watching documentaries and other educational shows whenever they were  available to me for as long as I can remember. Difficult to do as I was a kid pre-internet.  I also would read the dictionary, encyclopedias, and my older siblings text books from school. Was doing that from age of 8. So just because you may think that&#39;s impossible or something you would never do, doesn&#39;t mean you can speak for ALL 16 year old&#39;s."
5XFjLdNO4FU,Documentaries are super educational ...i think its great you watch them and want to learn
5XFjLdNO4FU,"These kids are acting out as they have been through or are going through alot and do not know how to process it or have learning difficulties. Either way they need the extra help, given by extra teachers. Otherwise they wont be succeeding like the quiet ones. This also stops them disrupting the more quiet kids too. Its not thier fault they&#39;re badly behaved, so not not adress them with time understanding and compassion is pointless"
5XFjLdNO4FU,Opalbird1 some of the kids in this documentary where shy and quiet so it&#39;s not just the noisy kids that are getting help
5XFjLdNO4FU,Massetgirl72 yep
5XFjLdNO4FU,Yeah...
5XFjLdNO4FU,✌
5XFjLdNO4FU,Pinkkitten004 👋🏾
5XFjLdNO4FU,"You can tell there are bad environments at home. Some show signs of poor nutrition which hugely affects their mental health and development. They have vitamin and mineral deficiencies. There are tell tell signs of abuse at home and parents not equipped to be good parents, due to their own problems."
5XFjLdNO4FU,"An outstanding thing about these educators is that the focus on providing what is best for their students. I don&#39;t hear them blaming and shaming the parents, other  teachers, or the children. They simply address the problem, treat the children with respect and proper attention, and have reasonable expectations for them."
5XFjLdNO4FU,oisha sha dos This angel without wings gives Jamie the hug that Mama should have given him before school. My heart breaks for him. That teacher is gentle yet firm.
5XFjLdNO4FU,"Right, but I done that with my child.  She was by my side 24/7 I kid you not.  I don&#39;t go out and drink, I don&#39;t have a fun time out with pals, I stay home with my children.  My child had to go into the nurture room because classroom scared her.  All those people.  She was not emotionally or mentally ready to sit still and do some numbers and alphabet at 4 and half years old. In fact I have personally noticed, not many children at that age are ready.  My son was the same.  But my other 2 daughters who went into school at 5 and half years old, were more than ready emotionally to cope with the classroom.  That is what is bugging me about these ill thought out comments.  Yours is tame in comparison to the others.  <br><br>The nurture room and the staff are absolutely fantastic with them.  It&#39;s more like home school I would say, but within school grounds where there are others to socialise with.  I would have home schooled my child if I had the brains to do so.  But I don&#39;t.  There are plenty of reasons why many of these children are in nurture room.  Dad has left home to go overseas for work, the family has broken down because parents split, Sensory issues i.e on the autistic spectrum, Older children within the home and their needs.  Getting the balance right is very difficult.  It&#39;s not just abused/neglected children who need the nurture room.  Not one parent can say they have it 100%, but it seems by some comments on here, that they expect that or take the kids away.  Sad :("
5XFjLdNO4FU,"A mixture of ADHD, social anxiety and autism"
5XFjLdNO4FU,Great for you it&#39;s the best job in the world. My sons both have disorders and I was like the teacher with blonde hair. Get on their level.
5XFjLdNO4FU,"Aw everyone&#39;s replied were so sweet, thank you all so much."
5XFjLdNO4FU,Thank you <br>I hope the years have found you well <br>Thank you for all you do and I pray one day you receive what you deserve 🍎 ✏️🌻 💚
5XFjLdNO4FU,You&#39;re a hero
5XFjLdNO4FU,God bless you! 🙏💞
5XFjLdNO4FU,Jessica Paden it kinda looked like he was having a seizure
5XFjLdNO4FU,Honestly I wish the teachers at my high school were like that- some of them were very nice and extremely patient but others just liked to shout at us - I did have a good high school experience don’t get me wrong but jeez some of the teachers just need to calm down and be more like Mrs Gabrith
5XFjLdNO4FU,"I partly agree that children of this generation use their disabilities as an excuse. Most of them weren’t disciplined properly. But I still think that this program is required to improve self esteem and social skills. I see your point of view, but I am a 13 year old girl with autism, severe anxiety and depression, social issues and sensory issues. My teachers support me through thick and thin. I am well behaved, but I still require the extra support for issues than intervene with my every day life. Once again, I see your point of view, but I believe that programs like this are still necessary to enhance children’s confidence, social skills and to set a good example to them, if at home they don’t get that role modelling and discipline."
5XFjLdNO4FU,0506xjl Not all kids have parents thst care for them. I luckly do and they helped me a whole lot. But some kids still need a bit of extra attention
5XFjLdNO4FU,"I am sure these kids aren&#39;t getting a lot of help at home, and that is most likely where the bad behaviour stems. Your son is lucky to have you, but not all kids are that lucky"
5XFjLdNO4FU,Preach. Adults are too soft on kids these days.
5XFjLdNO4FU,Carina J yes and overcrowded
5XFjLdNO4FU,I agree 100%
5XFjLdNO4FU,Not always the case so
5XFjLdNO4FU,Alice Berry yay Michigan so did you like teaching music
5XFjLdNO4FU,"Zekelyness: I m sorry you did not recieve the care and support every single child/ person derserves.Those people have failed you,but the best vindication is for you to rise above it and make the best out of your life and be happy. It is never too late to start over. You are never too old to persue your dreams and nomatter what your situation/ finances or age might be,if you work hard and perservire you will suceed in life.Don&#39;t ever give up."
5XFjLdNO4FU,Oja Z freaking finally someone said it.
5XFjLdNO4FU,"me too, ekeIyness. i wouId be a compIeteIy different person than i am today. yet, now that we know we were aIways worth something, Iet&#39;s make the best of the rest of our Iives."
5XFjLdNO4FU,"zekelyness<br>There always is hope in our worse trials...that being said they are never easy to go through.  I am now raising my autistic niece of 21 going on 5 with IQ of 54, very smart, just can&#39;t get it out...finding help is time consuming and draining...services shouldn&#39;t be this difficult to find, yet they are.  Most have no idea how these kids struggle.  Take care of yourself, to be the best you can be (if it&#39;s not 100%, it&#39;s not 100% - it&#39;s hard to give when you&#39;re depleted)...reach out and keep reaching out...you are not a lone, there are millions who know exactly how you struggle...let that give you strength..."
5XFjLdNO4FU,Likely not
5XFjLdNO4FU,"I don&#39;t rememeber the exact behaviours from when I watched the video but I have done alot of research due to my own situation and have seen some of the behaviours first hand. Research it yourself, I believe he looks shocked at some point almost like sezure which can be a sign of abuse, like flash backs. The agression the attention seeking, not feeling like a normal kid and trouble being with them. There&#39;s so many examples. If someone would sit down and talk to him and really try to find out what he&#39;s so upset about I bet you would find something."
5XFjLdNO4FU,"Christina Miller I&#39;m curious, why do you think that specifically is the reason?"
5XFjLdNO4FU,"toto genere that&#39;s what I was thinking especially Jason, looks like sexual abuse to me"
5XFjLdNO4FU,Theresa Hron I know that feeling too well I feel so much pain and stressed in school I was so bad at reading and calculating
5XFjLdNO4FU,Jeanne Kropko your right too say that bad behaviour does get more attention and thats wrong.
5XFjLdNO4FU,"Violence teaches violence. What you are describing is not proper discipline. It&#39;s abuse. I had been punished physically and it turned me into an angry, violent person. When my mum took over, she took a different approach and I was able to get past my anger issues and be a better person. All I learned from spankings was to hit back."
5XFjLdNO4FU,"This is not normal, normal parents don&#39;t slap their kids in the face.."
5XFjLdNO4FU,"DanaPatriciaMary1 Ive been beaten up a lot in my childhood, but it didnt teach me a lesson lol. So your theory isnt accurate"
5XFjLdNO4FU,"It&#39;s a great way to teach kids that when THEY  observe what they think is incorrect behavior, to strike out.  There are other non-violent ways of disciplining children.  I do agree that children need to learn consequences, to respect parents/authority/to not be coddled as they certainly can&#39;t demand that in the adult world.  <br><br>I also think that children with mental disorder diagnoses won&#39;t necessarily  learn the lessons you wish to teach.  Please know that some of their actions, which we may construe to be misbehavior, are not:  they are symptoms/behaviors associated with their condition.  Unless you learn which is which, your physical response may have unintended consequences.  <br><br>Congratulations on raising respectful children.  No need to physically hurt them; they&#39;ve already gotten the message."
5XFjLdNO4FU,"Patricia Egan, i dont know which moment you talking about but they take the kids out of their comfort zone (like hiding away or laughing/being aggressive when put on the spot). The smiles i see in this documentary when they realize it&#39;s good that they do something and get a price/applaud in front of everyone. Or the girl who realized everyone feels shy when being put on the spot. Those moments are needed and so right to learn at such an age. It gives the kids confidence."
5XFjLdNO4FU,"What the fuck, why are people getting so aggressive"
5XFjLdNO4FU,Breanna Thompson If you watch a lot of documentaries it gets easy. I know have no trouble with it and could probably do a pretty convincing accent. I&#39;ve watched probably around 100 documentaries and they are amazing. American&#39;s barely every make documentaries or at least good ones. It&#39;s sad.
5XFjLdNO4FU,"Sarah Louise omg lol I mean I wasn&#39;t taking a stab at how you spell or anything, I just said this dialect is hard to understand for me. Like if you listened to someone with a heavy Russian accent it would be hard to piece it together."
5XFjLdNO4FU,Spanking will make things worse anyway.
5XFjLdNO4FU,Samson as someone with sensory issues I defenitly agree! :D
5XFjLdNO4FU,Isa M The kids are there to change their behavior and learn to interact/play with others. You have to push them out of their comfort zone to realize that. It will only help them in the normal class and in making friends. (instead of getting bullied because they hide under a table and dont want to play)
5XFjLdNO4FU,"Debbie B not exactly. There are people from the older generations who grew up in loving, even strict families and grew up to exhibit similar behavioural issues. It really depends on the child as much as on the parents."
5XFjLdNO4FU,he could have seen it at home and copied it like when he pretended to be drunk it was spot on
5XFjLdNO4FU,You shouldn&#39;t think like that about autistic kids <br>I have autism ADHD anger issues and anxiety and peeple makes fun off me all the time
5XFjLdNO4FU,"Jason was simply acting out. There was no history of seizure and, as the film shows, he ended up doing beautifully and the problems disappeared with help from the Nurture Room and his mother&#39;s progress.. :)"
5XFjLdNO4FU,"Christina Miller please go on,explain you reasoning behind this"
5XFjLdNO4FU,Laura Fleischer I thot the same thing
5XFjLdNO4FU,I made this same comment too- I thought it looked like an absence seizure too. The way he was acting beforehand adds up. He didn&#39;t react to any stimulus during the episode and his breathing got a little bit erratic. When he came out he gave that big huff as well. I hope they checked it out and he turned out OK.
5XFjLdNO4FU,@Laura Fleischer not a lot that can be done other than making sure. He doesnt hit his head.
5XFjLdNO4FU,Looked like a seizure to me
5XFjLdNO4FU,"@Alina PorterFalse. He did not immediately &quot;leave his chair&quot;.<br>Besides, how could a young child &quot;fake&quot; what happened to his body, and the staring without blinking that occurred after said &quot;attack&quot;?"
5XFjLdNO4FU,Lmao no he was doing it to get out of work🤦‍♀️ you guys are the definition of gullible! <br>As soon as she looked away he used the opportunity to leave his chair. He knew she would ignore and turn to another student giving him an opportunity to escape. I’m glad the teachers have more education and discernment than you YouTube doctors because if she didn’t she would just be reinforcing negative behavior and cause it to become negative AND attention seeking behavior leading it to progress and make it worse. <br>Now the girl Jordan seems like she legitimately has some undiagnosed problems. I haven’t finished the video but the poor girl can’t even even properly! I mean she needed subtitles lol
5XFjLdNO4FU,No kidding! Right when I was complaining about my day. Hats off!! Frfr
5XFjLdNO4FU,@Grant aww bless her she’s such a lovely woman really cares about the school kids 😁😁🤩🤩
5XFjLdNO4FU,@Grant Watched 2 documentaries featuring your wonderful Mum. I work in residential child care and it’s people like her that make our work so much easier. In these testing times I hope she can continue to do such amazing work.
5XFjLdNO4FU,@Grant tell your mom that she is one special Angel! I absolutely fell in love with her kind and loving heart! ❤️🇨🇦
5XFjLdNO4FU,Avalon Ressler I love her soft spoken voice
5XFjLdNO4FU,silly comment ellie.  people like  to learn and to care.  it all helps.
5XFjLdNO4FU,No he isn&#39;t
5XFjLdNO4FU,"FAS is now considered a spectrum disorder. A milder form, without facial problems, is FAE, fetal alcohol effects."
5XFjLdNO4FU,Manuela Darazsdi I have FAS but am very high functioning
5XFjLdNO4FU,How does it feel
5XFjLdNO4FU,@Reg sorry about that<br>I didn’t mean both parents<br>I should have been clearer
5XFjLdNO4FU,"@David McManus Why didn&#39;t you answer Nicole B when she asked you how your &quot; cuz &quot;  Jason&#39;s doing ?  Is it because  A: he&#39;s in prison  B: he&#39;s on drugs/a alcoholic C : he&#39;s dead 😳  D : your just a bloody liar and he&#39;s not your cousin 🤒  or E : he is your cousin but he&#39;s not doing well so you said ..nothing !  ( must be E ,if he&#39;s doing great a cousin would say so and you didn&#39;t..  &quot;cuz&quot; 🤒 )"
5XFjLdNO4FU,@EdgyMTB Easy you were the ultimate rebel ...the white sheep
5XFjLdNO4FU,@EdgyMTB fear and anxiety causing you to be an over achiever in an attempt to find some form of acceptance or praise that you maybe craved? Or you maybe didn&#39;t want any attention on you so tried to be invisible?
5XFjLdNO4FU,"glad she is happy at school.  with free online programmes and outside groups, you can home school your child and learn alongside.  just remember this for high school!"
5XFjLdNO4FU,"Thank you.  It&#39;s exactly what my kid is going through right now.  She is in the nurture room.  I think my child&#39;s problem is, too much attention from me, that she never wanted to go to school, she wanted to stay home with me.  If I had the brains I would have home schooled her, but I also wanted her to have a social life too, make friends.  Her big sister was her best friend for a long time, but after a while at school she made more friends. xx"
5XFjLdNO4FU,this was a fantastic unjudgemental documentary.  it made me sad to read the comments judging children&#39;s home lives and families- a child can still have low self esteem or ADHD with all the love in the world. If we take the view that the child comes from a &quot;bad&quot; family we&#39;re writing that child off before they&#39;ve even begun. the staff  (not just in this film) are wonderful.  The mum who was talking about her child and wanting a fresh start- she clearly loves her children but do we know what childhood or what struggles she&#39;s had? Nature Rooms are wonderful - as they said if they can help the children with social and emotional skills as early as they can it help reduce problems later on.
5XFjLdNO4FU,MissSindorei sorry to hear that! But it seems you are good Person!
5XFjLdNO4FU,Rosie and Casper&#39;s Channel oh. Sorry then. Ya. I work w little ones too and usually the ones that are very disruptive in class are even worse at home.. so I fear for these parents.
5XFjLdNO4FU,Rosie and Casper&#39;s Channel what&#39;s not true? I said nothing about whose fault it is. I&#39;m just wondering how life at home is.
5XFjLdNO4FU,"Andreea Spoiala Not at all,otherwise they would Not behave like that"
5XFjLdNO4FU,Be careful with diagnosis ....so easy to put behaviors on a “spectrum” I’ve worked 20 plus years with children diagnosed with Austin and similar cognitive disorders. It’s soooi difficult ....
5XFjLdNO4FU,"I never fit in in school, I was diagnosed with bpd and anxiety not long ago and I think that&#39;s what it was from the start. My conditions were brought on by early childhood trauma though, sometimes I think they don&#39;t even see that as a possibility. sometimes kids can&#39;t remember what&#39;s happened bc their mind shuts it out but they still act out from the initial trauma"
5XFjLdNO4FU,"Autism is a meme, it isn&#39;t real.  This is mental retardation and it&#39;s becoming a LOT more prevalent these days because there&#39;s a TON of heavy metals in the food and water.  Children aren&#39;t developing correctly."
5XFjLdNO4FU,JUST boys are more obvious earlier..
5XFjLdNO4FU,Boys usually show earlier signs of ADHD and autism. Girls are much more aware and better at hiding the fact that somethings wrong. And some of these kids dont get the help at home.
5XFjLdNO4FU,Maria Torres I&#39;m an ex alcoholic and I am able to have kids but i.dont want to because my disease is also genetic and I don&#39;t want my kids turning into alcoholic s
5XFjLdNO4FU,Madeleine Morris meh feelz..
5XFjLdNO4FU,Maria Torres do you know what it takes to give up alcohol?? Don&#39;t be too quick to judge
5XFjLdNO4FU,"Ex-alcoholic doesn&#39;t mean jack shit, it anything shows their a strong person.  And as for poor language, that&#39;s just annoying really.  You pass judgement very fast"
5XFjLdNO4FU,diet and daily schedule help this kids understand the chaotic environment
5XFjLdNO4FU,"Not only their diet, their entire home life. I went to school in one of the schools they filmed (although about 10 years before!!) but some of the kids have no routine, no set meal times, they get diagnosed with adhd which magically goes away once the school gets the parents to enforce a set bed time so the kids get a whole nights sleep. We have a major problem with parents who have no idea how to &quot;parent&quot; and no desire to either!!!"
5XFjLdNO4FU,"Dontmakemebiteyou I agree. I have a 4 year old son with aspergers. after changing his diet to lower sugar he&#39;s now much more polite, helpful and much less all over the place"
5XFjLdNO4FU,nope maybe they have underlying disorders like autism adhd aspergers and asbegers
5XFjLdNO4FU,"So you had this experience in your life and you think that every child had a childhood like yours? Go educate yourself. No, no, no... Life will teach you, wait and see... ;)"
5XFjLdNO4FU,"Sara Dumas That&#39;s not always the case, sometimes it&#39;s due to a part of emotion caused by the brain and neurons. You can&#39;t ALWAYS blame it on the parent, kids can still turn out amazing abused, neglected, or not."
5XFjLdNO4FU,My parents  raised my well and I was very well behaved in front of them  but not when there back was turned . My younger brother was really well behaved and the youngest was more middle of the line . Kids are also there own people and no two are alike .
5XFjLdNO4FU,"*It&#39;s not JUST the juice<br>Large intakes of sugar can have an affect on them. Maybe not as much as jo jo was implying, but it still does."
5XFjLdNO4FU,Did you notice how much they changed over the year EVEN THOUGH they were having orange juice??? It&#39;s not the juice!
5XFjLdNO4FU,"+Grant <br>Thank you so much. Oh! How sad that is to hear about Jordyn. Your Mum is probably one of, if not the best, people Jordyn ever had in her life. The area that the school is in looks like a rough place for a child to grow up in, and there are so many factors that come into play with what happens when kids become teens. I&#39;m not condoning her crime if she is guilty, but how very sad to hear. I thank you for your reply, Grant."
5XFjLdNO4FU,Sharon G thanks very much ! yeah so do I do be honest lol unfortunately Jordyn is in a young offenders institution now her and her friends got charged with an attempt murder.
5XFjLdNO4FU,+Grant <br>PS Your Mum is amazing! I wish I had a teacher like her when I was in Primary School.
5XFjLdNO4FU,+Grant <br>Do you know Jordyn? I would like to know how she is doing now. Is she happy? She touched my heart in this documentary. 💛
5XFjLdNO4FU,kar jam I&#39;m one of her children lol thanks
5XFjLdNO4FU,"The parents most probably have friends that are in jail etc.. when children are exposed to serious negative situations, it becomes normalised. Still the implications are the same"
5XFjLdNO4FU,•Rachel• could I know what he was saying .i couldn&#39;t quite hear it.
5XFjLdNO4FU,Simon Kapss he’s a boy that’s how I played when I was little
5XFjLdNO4FU,Simon Kapss well.....its in Scotland so......yeah he&#39;s seen and heard way too much
5XFjLdNO4FU,Simon Kapss I was thinking the same thing.
5XFjLdNO4FU,@Currlinne S - well said couldn’t agree with you more 😊😊
5XFjLdNO4FU,Currline s I&#39;m seeing a bunch of positive comments.
5XFjLdNO4FU,"Currline s so true,I agree💯"
5XFjLdNO4FU,Currline s s
5XFjLdNO4FU,"Nope,  it does sound like  &quot;The torture Room&quot; , you little party devil!"
5XFjLdNO4FU,partypoison485 nurture rooms are very helpfull

5XFjLdNO4FU,@May Sal I work in social services
5XFjLdNO4FU,What do you work as can I ask?
5XFjLdNO4FU,2018!
5XFjLdNO4FU,2018 bro.
5XFjLdNO4FU,2018
5XFjLdNO4FU,2018
5XFjLdNO4FU,Yes! Lol
5XFjLdNO4FU,I feel like I need subtitles for probably 90% of the people!
5XFjLdNO4FU,Ihold8stars As someone with tourettes and sensory issues I can tell you sometimes I am a bother to my classmates. And my school has no room extra for kids thst are special needs or even just need a little more attention. But its manageable with conversation.
5XFjLdNO4FU,Ihold8stars i agree
5XFjLdNO4FU,"Well... that&#39;s good if it worked for you. I don&#39;t have attention problems, though keeping up the pace forever was impossible for me. I just loved the teachers that gave me some breathing time. Sometimes we just want to discover the world, talk to friends, read the part of the book that is the most interesting, recharge our brains or just break the monotony... stern teachers just punish us for doing anything that isn&#39;t study the thing of the day. <br>The classic factory system is useful to give this impression that we are doing something serious as we set foot at school, the huge drawback is that it sets a pace and punish us for doing anything out of it, while considering that if you can&#39;t keep up then you&#39;re bad somehow. This definitely doesn&#39;t help any special kid. I guess your example is a rare case. Just an opinion though<br><br>I guess what we need is a reform on the formation of teachers that would make them understand child behaviour better and be more sensible to development in general. Calling the problematic and energetic kid a bad person and depriving he/she of some good things as punishment for not being completely still won&#39;t make the ADHD go away, nor is the kid a &quot;pointless rebel&quot;.<br>The nurture room is definitely an improvement in dealing with it, way better than force the kid to stay still while not understanding why the kid is like this in the first place."
5XFjLdNO4FU,"Marcos Socram I always comment as I go along, otherwise I will forget points I wanted to make. I think if given the choice, most young children would prefer not to be stuck in the routine classroom rigor. They’d rather be letting loose, chatting, and doing their work at their own pace. Unfortunately that isn’t what every kid needs. The majority need that stern, boring, atmosphere of rules, and deadlines. Otherwise they would never learn anything in a practical amount of time. Having dealt with ADHD my entire life, I found that while I loved the laid back teachers, and classrooms most, I respected the more stern teachers more. The teachers that did a lot of correcting of my behavior, but also never lost patience of it. Even with my behavior being out of control at times, the best classroom environment for me generally was the traditional one."
5XFjLdNO4FU,"The main purpose of the first steps of school is not to study but to interact with others. It&#39;s best to have 3 rooms for each class, one for the kids that want to study more intensely and other for the ones that want to be alone or around less people<br><br>edit: wooops, posted before watching everything. I will leave the comment here anyway"
5XFjLdNO4FU,That&#39;s not always the case. Some grow up so resentful of what other members of their family get that they kill their parents. It needs to be addressed when they&#39;re young. My brother used to act out at school and we had a loving mum. Don&#39;t generalise and stop laying the all the blame on the parents!
5XFjLdNO4FU,"I know kids got jealous towards other kid ,like my own kid when she was younger but they change when they grow up !"
5XFjLdNO4FU,"This is a job that has to be done from the heart, with pure love. And not everyone has an open heart"
5XFjLdNO4FU,Tilly Don&#39;t care 😂😂😂😭😭😭😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣
5XFjLdNO4FU,😂😂😂😂
5XFjLdNO4FU,Thanks for the laugh.😂😂😂😂😂
5XFjLdNO4FU,Salice McCool as someone who does not believe in altruism i do not agree that these teachers get nothing from their work and are selfless. <br>i work in the caring profession and its only been the last 4 years out of 20 that i received a good wage for it.<br>i also chose to do this work for a low income and with lots of heartache and hassle i would not have experienced in other professions.<br>i still chose to go and i received back far more than monetary gain.<br>the remark was not snidey. it was factual. <br>the teachers get lots more than money from the job - more than those they teach.
5XFjLdNO4FU,"+georgina cat  You obviously don&#39;t realize it, but your snide remark serves only to strengthen the argument that teachers such as those shown here are unconscionably underpaid.  By reminding us that they&#39;ve chosen this profession regardless of this fact, you&#39;ve further underscored their value to society while also pointing out their selflessness.  Thank you!"
5XFjLdNO4FU,ToyTube TVT supply teachers because they work less than normal teacher earn less even though they are more educated. Teachers don&#39;t make tons
5XFjLdNO4FU,ToyTube TVT you do know the teachers aren&#39;t conscripted and choose to do.the work?
5XFjLdNO4FU,Get a job
5XFjLdNO4FU,I had a lot of behaviour and discipline problems as a kid  . I now  own my own business and never drank or got into drugs or problems with the law .  One doesn&#39;t always correlate to the other  .
5XFjLdNO4FU,"I disagree about having to meet them all on different levels. Not that I am a man hater, or I want everyone to burn. I am just very specific, and when something happens that I don&#39;t like, I get upset. The lets write down notes and let me read everything to you is how I work. I hate hands on stuff, and if it ever becomes a norm to do so, I guess I would just drop out. <br>It&#39;s because of these troubled kids (and I mean troubled, not just bored and frustrated kids) that we have all these crappy and stupid ideas being taught in school."
5XFjLdNO4FU,"yes by all means lets ignorer these boys and let them grow up just as bad and abuse or murder their wives, girlfriends, children etc because we punished them for their disorders rather than teaching them to cope. These kids are a product of their environment or a brain injury. Behaviour this consistent and severe is not only out of their capacity to control, but it is Torture for them. Volunteer in an ED or BD classroom for a week at your local elementary school and you&#39;ll see these kids behavior hurts them tremendously but they were never taught to process or cope with their emotions and impulses."
5XFjLdNO4FU,"need job all Children Who have this Problems,Boys and Gilde,need Love and attention,thats all! But No offense,parents did wrong!"

5XFjLdNO4FU,"Funny I&#39;m American and understood everything. Maybe the way a person hears the words being spoken are different with people. I do understand  people asking for subtitles if English isn&#39;t their native tongue. I like subtitles when watching something from Denmark, France etc."
5XFjLdNO4FU,Aurélie Zinaida V. Listen better.
5XFjLdNO4FU,"Aurélie Zinaida V. I was able to turn the captions on, I live in the US and can understand a lot of thick accents, one of my friends is fluent in Portuguese so I understand where you&#39;re coming from, it&#39;s difficult for someone not used to the accent. I sometimes turn it on so I don&#39;t have to rewind it to hear certain phrases a billion times just to make sure I heard it correctly lol.. what&#39;s funny is everyone from different countries always say Americans have accents, and those who do live in the US thinks people from different states have accents. I live in Pittsburgh, Pa and when I go on vacation people always tell me I have an accent even though I don&#39;t think I do. It&#39;s not noticeable to me and the people in my area like it is when someone talks with a southern accent"
5XFjLdNO4FU,Aurélie Zinaida V. P.s. your English is amazing:)
5XFjLdNO4FU,Aurélie Zinaida V. It&#39;s called scots Gaelic ( pronounced Scots gallick) but they are only speaking English click in the captions button in English to help I live in Spain and appreciate Spanish subtitles so I feel your pain

5XFjLdNO4FU,"Sean Fenwick I don&#39;t think you understand that there are kids that are not the way you where as a kid. I for example have sensory issues, tourettes and panic attacks. But thanks for my school understanding and helping I&#39;m on the same level as all other of my classmates. With out (in my school befor) I could not cope at all"
5XFjLdNO4FU,"Can everyone please stop arguing about which way to teach children is better? A child is a person, and a person is unique. Sometimes, someone needs reward for success in order to grow up properly. And sometimes, one needs punishment for failure. There is no &quot;one size fits all&quot; method of parenting, nor is there one for teaching."
5XFjLdNO4FU,"I had Ritalin and physical abuse when I was a child. I don&#39;t think abuse is the answer - or drugs. But yes, if civilization is not going to collapse we need to start taking the raising of children a bit more seriously once again."
5XFjLdNO4FU,do you live with these people? no one not even you have the right to tell anyone how to spend their money no matter where this money comes from.
5XFjLdNO4FU,maybe its all the can afford. it really pisses me off when people continue to bring down poor people. if it bothers you that badly give to food banks &amp; help the poor
5XFjLdNO4FU,Emily Kocher if you have a brain disorder it kind of is. They don&#39;t connect it with their actions like other kids might &amp; many parents take it much farther than &quot;a light smack&quot;
5XFjLdNO4FU,"Scandilicious you call spanking abuse, really? Lol"
5XFjLdNO4FU,"Exactly, Marie Vermette! It is more than likely why they are behaving like this in the first place. Abuse doesn&#39;t solve anything, it causes more problems. Shame on you Tina Davies!"

If your brother loves art and is super-talented as you put it, he&#39;s probably not going to want to be a schoolteacher or a tax lawyer when he grows up, so what&#39;s he doing wasting his time in public school, which is designed specifically to turn people into 100% obedient robots, whereas expressive art is supposed to make people be/feel more human and less robotic and zombie-like?"
2Yt6raj-S1M,Art are evolving
2Yt6raj-S1M,I agree. My parents tell me; &quot;Do what the teachers ask and you&#39;ll get good grades&quot;
2Yt6raj-S1M,"So relatable! Whenever I do school projects, the teachers give me a detailed rubric and the whole time I just think about what the teacher wants me to do so I can get the work done and secure that grade. I never really think much about what I truly want to do with the project"
2Yt6raj-S1M,one of these passions u have is literally my passion becoming a pro athlete...
2Yt6raj-S1M,"i can relate to this so much. On a math test, i literally got the most simplest answer correct, yet i didnt get the mark cuz i didnt do my working. LIKE I CAN DO IT IN MY HEAD GODDAMN"
2Yt6raj-S1M,"Schools then and now are very similar. In fact I believe schools back then were probably a lot more strict, teachers were allowed to hit students and make them serve heavy punishments. Students could not retaliate. The &quot;edUCaTiooN sySteM&quot; feeding us curiosity and creativity is a BIG lie."
2Yt6raj-S1M,frr we all have different mathematical formula strategies and school doesn&#39;t accept that 🙄 it&#39;s frustrating
2Yt6raj-S1M,"&quot;Why are you depressed?&quot;<br>&quot;This is so easy why are you failing on this?&quot;<br>&quot;Do better, I know this isn&#39;t your best&quot;<br>&quot;Wait until I call your parents&quot; <br>&quot;I&#39;ll give you 2x Homework for that&quot; <br>Yep. All we can do is imagine getting good grades. Just imagine..."
2Yt6raj-S1M,@rei sad life
2Yt6raj-S1M,so true
2Yt6raj-S1M,"That is a good teacher right there. We really have to find out who is really pulling the strings of the education system. It&#39;s hard to tell who is, though. We need to pin point someone so that things actually start to change."

2Yt6raj-S1M,"ouch, same. I want to be an animator so i can share my animations online but ouch there&#39;s no subject involved with animating at Malaysia other than a special university owns it 😔"
2Yt6raj-S1M,"Read English YT comments, watch TV series in English, read stories in English and try to communicate with people on the internet that can also speak English. It&#39;s a good way to improve your bilingual skills and you&#39;ll get used to it in no time, trust me, English is like a second main language to me lmao"
2Yt6raj-S1M,"Reading is the utmost to key to master English imo. Read all kinds of books, be it fiction , non fiction and attempt writing prompts by yourself and learn 3 new, different words everyday.  I guess that should help. And I understand u feel really insecure when it comes to your academics and the way you feel is definitely valid cuz ive been there too, but don&#39;t be too hard on yourself. Sometimes its our mind playing games with us when we often think that people are judging us, but well,  the chances are , they most probably aren&#39;t.  YOU GOT THIS AND I&#39;M ROOTING FOR YOU&lt;333"
2Yt6raj-S1M,"My advice is to watch lots of English videos and read lots of things in English. Good luck! English is my first language but I love learning other languages, it’s a difficult process but you get there in the end."
2Yt6raj-S1M,"Bro English is my second language too you just remember simple things like what tence a word is etc, but some words are confusing. What i can say is i learned more English from internet than English classes .  Just be positive everything would br okay"

2Yt6raj-S1M,"@joe im what would probably be considered as a gifted child and i tell ya when you atribute your self worth to grades, when everyone expects pretty much perfect scores the moment you can&#39;t keep up with a subject it hits you like a train. In the pandemic i had a full om breakdown because i couldn&#39;t finish an english assingment, no matter how hard i tried i just couldn&#39;t do it once it had been around 3 days getting nothing done on it i burst into tears of frustration with myself and getting scolded for not finishing it certainly didn&#39;t help matters. During the 2 weeks i was trying to complete it i was just misserable.<br>The truth is that the toxic mentality that school teaches us can mess with you."
2Yt6raj-S1M,"what stresses me most is the scholarship. I even took year 6 math class during the weekends just to get better, but...i’d like to keep my aquarius iq"
2Yt6raj-S1M,"I know right! Our future, intelligence, and all the good stuff in our life shouldn&#39;t be determined by a number or letter. It&#39;s just a grade, what can it do anyways? Pressure students to succeed, make them depressed, and grow social anxiety?"
2Yt6raj-S1M,@ραѕтєℓ αт тнє ¢σяηєя My phone can relate to this.
2Yt6raj-S1M,"@Stallone Andrew Same. I&#39;m a Filipino and I hated learning Filipino/Tagalog (People say they are different but they are exactly the same without any differences) but when I studied Filipino on my own without anybody pressuring me, I actually enjoyed it."
2Yt6raj-S1M,"@Yael Levi  yep, and i think school was completely didn&#39;t care about student&#39;s opinion. And oh boy i completely hate Malay language because why most of the homeworks are just writing and essay. <br><br>Ps i was a Malaysian"
2Yt6raj-S1M,@Stallone Andrew that sounds terrible.
2Yt6raj-S1M,"ouch, i can feel your opinion. Because during the tusyen at my elementary school i just said why should need to learn the same thing over and over again until my Malay language teacher begin to mad at me. And the worst part about the tusyen is it was devided to two class which is one for learning Malay because those one owns bad grades while the other one on the other hand who passed their Malay test having their own class and somewhat they not learning but playing Scrambles and some other things. It was unfair"
2Yt6raj-S1M,nahh it&#39;s not a fun fact i would call it a painful fact

2Yt6raj-S1M,&quot;Exams just get students good at taking tests&quot; --my high school physics teacher
2Yt6raj-S1M,yeah man. I don&#39;t believe in exams except for the competitive ones that you got to take during or after highschool. But why keep dousing students with exams and keep them stressed like ever during the childhood?
2Yt6raj-S1M,"&quot;thEY&#39;RE To eVAluAtE WherE yoU aRE At RighT noW&quot; and if you get a bad mark, they basically DO NOT care. When they do, they just keep screaming the same things at you until you are forced into nodding when they ask, &quot;do you understand?&quot;"
2Yt6raj-S1M,"@The Ruler01 That is EXACLY the main problem with education today. Most students, me included, simply study for the sake of getting something good on a paper, not actually for the sake of learning. Studying for the sake of getting good grades is very different from studying for the sake of learning, but studying for good grades is more likely to give you just that, better grades. However, most students, me included, will then forget 95% of what you learned the week after the exam, but if you actually studied for the sake of learning, it is far more likely you will remember more and longer. But at the end of the day, it is what the paper says that will give you the best chance for the job and hence, the incentive to simply study for the exam and not learn is the main one, and highlights the problem with the education system."
2Yt6raj-S1M,After exam my brain get washed like I nothing ever studied
2Yt6raj-S1M,that&#39;s mean
2Yt6raj-S1M,it really did
2Yt6raj-S1M,"Yeah since I even believe it’s happening to my friend, my friend loves drawing very often since even drawing class very often, but often they get yelled at because of drawing so much in class. Only the science teacher understands that they have a lot of potential it doesn’t always scream at them for that. School does kill creativity! But some people don’t give up their creative side."
2Yt6raj-S1M,"Basically I don&#39;t know what happened to my creativity, I got praised through the whole middle school for writing differently, and I really appreciate the teacher&#39;s encouragement by giving me praising notes even I got a low score under the criteria set by school, but now in high school all are changed and my teacher tells me to stop writing like this  and that and it is just so frustrating that I found I cannot manage my flow quite well during this kind of &quot;training for better essays&quot;😢"

2Yt6raj-S1M,@Kawaii Days I agree with you it&#39;s so much better learning things on your own than being forced to. I&#39;m glad you were able to find your interest and congratulations on your project.💃🏾👏🏾
2Yt6raj-S1M,"Kinda same to me. I wasn&#39;t really in to music history when the school first introduced to me. When I started watching Twoset (lil shout out lol :&gt;) and music anime I learned a lot of fun facts and started to get more into the music lessons. Same goes to history too. <br><br>Also one time the teacher asks us to do a project for music history: make a video about a composer. I got Chopin. When I search things myself, I found a lot of interesting facts and stuff and makes me more into the project having fun while doing an assignment. With my interest on video making and editing, I make it with all my effort. The teacher taught us a lot of other composers such as Bach and Mozart, but my favorite is Chopin. Coz I figure these things out my own and potray it in a way I&#39;m interested of. Instead of just him telling me with ws and books. After that, I always listen to classical music, especially Chopin&#39;s works. This shows that how important for letting students to investigate stuff themselves rather than sitting here, listen to the teacher&#39;s talking. <br><br>And I nap at physics lessons 🌚"

2Yt6raj-S1M,"We don&#39;t live in a utopian society. Society needs jobs more than anything, school produces educated people which go to college and become lawyers, doctors, and scientists.

No matter if you want or don&#39;t want, you would get changed and become more like people who&#39;s always around you. I feel very lucky to be born in an age where Internet existed. I wouldn&#39;t be aware of the possibilities of my life if there wasn&#39;t the books I bought online, videos I&#39;ve watched, comments I&#39;ve read.<br><br>Perhaps I like to use phones and computers because I have more sense of belonging here."

2Yt6raj-S1M,@Stormy yeah you completely missed the point
2Yt6raj-S1M,True
2Yt6raj-S1M,@V.K no they really havent.
2Yt6raj-S1M,Yes they have.
2Yt6raj-S1M,Although my school is about 8 hours and an extra hour for sports
2Yt6raj-S1M,Six Cruel Hours Of Our Lives
2Yt6raj-S1M,bruh same
2Yt6raj-S1M,😂🤣😂
2Yt6raj-S1M,same
2Yt6raj-S1M,I got someone I know<br>😏🤭🤣🤣🤣✌
2Yt6raj-S1M,Yep agreed.
2Yt6raj-S1M,and blindly obey the authority
2Yt6raj-S1M,"As a student, I agree with your words"
2Yt6raj-S1M,@Sab Draws I know right
2Yt6raj-S1M,and my teachers gotta hear this 🤧
2Yt6raj-S1M,x
2Yt6raj-S1M,@Theo Wolf oup. Well even tho am not that good at English since it&#39;s not my real language
2Yt6raj-S1M,"&quot;teached.&quot; yeah, you have obviously been in school long enough to say that"
2Yt6raj-S1M,@Sweet girl 678 you know i think school should have a subject all about different things in life like how to start a business that could spark a passion within students for an area.
2Yt6raj-S1M,"I totally agree but in my School we have a subject called life&#39;s project in which we are taught how to love ourselfs and things like that. But what you said is true they only teach that we gotta have a career , so there&#39;s a lot of pressure basically"
2Yt6raj-S1M,@Mohammad sabit hard when you are constantly frowned down upon when you dont get a perfect score on a test or dont fall in line with the path school teaches because we atribute our self worth to our work
2Yt6raj-S1M,"@Jim Bob the better question would be why we feel the need to be taught that when it should be a given, maybe because society is messed up and we atribute our personsl worth to our work. Also therapists teach you plenty of personal stuff this included"
2Yt6raj-S1M,@Chr1stown sheesh
2Yt6raj-S1M,"Try exploring anything!  Do the things that you see people do like <br><br>Reading and when i was 11 i started reading the Percy Jackson: Lighting Thief Novel and i was amaze and i love the book and the series<br><br>And i started reading books that my friend (that is novel book lover like me) recommended me some books and let me borrowed it and i also got amazed<br><br>Then during quarantine i started exploring great Novels and found out that the movies/Series i love to watch are based of Novels like Miss Peregrine, Horton, The Witch, The lion and the Wardrobe, Howls Moving Castle, How To Train Your Dragon, The Rise Of The Guardian etc and i was so amazed by the Creativity and i started to imagine stories in my head like whenever i hear songs i always imagine something and that inspired me to be a Novelist<br><br>And i also started watching more good movies/Series like Spiderman (all three of the different Spiderman), Umbrella Academy, Merlin, IT, A lot of other Marvel movies etc and it kinda made me think that i wanna be an Actress as well <br><br>So start exploring and start doing new things and you&#39;ll find out what ur passionate about 😊"

2Yt6raj-S1M,"@LovelyRxse  yep, and of course i hate double standards especially the one involved boy getting pains even if he didn&#39;t deserve it while girls on the other hand didn&#39;t face any punishment for their actions. and yeah my comment was off topic about school but it&#39;s also related to sexism"
2Yt6raj-S1M,"im a girl and i agree with that, everyone should be treated equally!"
2Yt6raj-S1M,"@Stegotyranno 420 although, i do agree, in most places boys are treated worse than girls and sometimes girls can get away with stuff like abusing boys while they will be seen as weak"
2Yt6raj-S1M,"I found out what I want to work towards as a future career through an anime, not school. Not even joking."
2Yt6raj-S1M,ikr
2Yt6raj-S1M,@Nikhil Pranav I agree so much with you
2Yt6raj-S1M,"I agree my idea is when you reach highschool whatever you want to be let&#39;s say you want to be an engineer, they put you in certain classes like math and science that give you the knowledge to prepare you when you go to college"

2Yt6raj-S1M,"its easy, there is literally a magic formula to fix it i suppose"
2Yt6raj-S1M,"@ROM LUNDY Yes, but I think schools should encourage this in school as well. You have a point, but schools need ot implement real life problem challenges so the students can learn about authentic STEM issues."
2Yt6raj-S1M,"@ROM LUNDY yep I know, I sayd that just to make the joke,"
2Yt6raj-S1M,"@ROM LUNDY uhhh thanks for the advice a lot of this is helpful and I’m aware of a lot of it , but I was thinking something along the lines of stickers not full on heavy work..."

2Yt6raj-S1M,"@ToaMataNui1  1. You always gotta communicate ideas, proposals, grant applications, etc. using language, &amp; you don&#39;t want to sound like an un-educated illiterate hick.<br>2. It&#39;s about being &quot;well-rounded,&quot; learning things outside your tiny focus,  becoming aware of other cultures, viewpoints, etc. <br>3. You don&#39;t have to remember all that. <br>You&#39;ll barely remember what you learn in your major."
2Yt6raj-S1M,"@eggman  no, but it could help you be smarter with the salary you make so you can retire with an injury &amp; be ok.<br>Also, it helps you solve problems in a systematic way :<br>What do I know? What am i trying to find?  (Solution, endgame) What info do I need? What info is here&amp; useless in this problem? What (equation) steps do I need to take to solve this problem?<br>That approach works on theoretical math problems, but also the tree that fell on your roof, the neighbor issue, your kid&#39;s issue(s) with a teacher or school, and etc. <br>However, if you&#39;re going to be apro ball player,  you don&#39;t need calculus, but you should be good enough at basic algebra &amp; business math.<br>Says the just-60-yr-old engineer/ teacher."
2Yt6raj-S1M,"@Morino Hisagi I mean if you don&#39;t want to do calculus, go to a trade school."
2Yt6raj-S1M,"@Logimite That&#39;s great for you, but calculus is forced upon you whether you want to need it or not, that&#39;s what I&#39;m saying"
2Yt6raj-S1M,I want to become an audio algorithm programmer and calculus is helping me a lot in that.
2Yt6raj-S1M,don&#39;t forget the intellectual teacher&#39;s pet.

2Yt6raj-S1M,I am listening to this instead of doing my homework
2Yt6raj-S1M,"FR, entry-level jobs aren&#39;t even entry level anymore. You do everything you can in life and it still fails. So many people equate sports and work-out with academics -- it&#39;s just not possible. Hard work in sports/work-out pays off, but not hard work in academics. It all just depends on whether the teacher is in your favor or not. They can choose to continue denying it, but it&#39;s true."
2Yt6raj-S1M,ouch.

2Yt6raj-S1M,He&#39;s a fictional character with no real knowledge.
2Yt6raj-S1M,"bad teachersr get no respect<br>a good example is my previous history teacher, he would spit out something in class like most teachers, and i usually got bad grades (since i can pick up more at school than at home), then we got a new history teacher which was way, way more interesting, didn&#39;t ask us to write a lot, when he talks he actually puts effort for you to understand something, and i always got A&#39;s or in rare cases B&#39;s in his class (tasks were as hard as they were with my previous teacher), all in all, my new teacher is a great teacher and everyone respects him"
2Yt6raj-S1M,"the only way to change the system, is by reaching the top of the system, good luck if you have bad grades"

2Yt6raj-S1M,Nah the dislikes are from the people at the top controlling the educational system. The teachers are too overworked to care.

2Yt6raj-S1M,"A lot of the time I wrote, did anything, I would always try to make sure that it was something that expressed me. Now I just make things to fit well to someone&#39;s criteria. That&#39;s what school has taught me so far."
2Yt6raj-S1M,Same
2Yt6raj-S1M,"Seriously, I was working on a series that I dreamt about. I have motivation to do it. However, when my teacher said we assign to have online group project. That make me lose motivation, now I don&#39;t even feel like to make a story."

2Yt6raj-S1M,Which one is?
2Yt6raj-S1M,"@vayichi eclipsed yeah, teachers actually telling what we need to do? That makes no sense lol."
2Yt6raj-S1M,imagine remembering that you have bio homework
2Yt6raj-S1M,Why does this remind me of my abusive parents-
2Yt6raj-S1M,"And then when a kid gets a bad grade they are taken away from clubs and activities that could actually be something to them for their future.  They never take into account that not everyone wants to be a scientist or accountant or a nurse or an author.  Like say you joined a dance club but your grade was below the grade you needed to get to pass and then you were not eligible to be in the dance club but your aspiration was to be a dancer when you were older.  There are many jobs that just include being physical not everything is about mental and the facts you can hold in your brain.  It ticks me off that they take away something that truly brings you joy and confidence as well as the momentum to keep going, just because you got below a 64-65"
2Yt6raj-S1M,"This is about 10 000 to 24 000 hours of schooling, this effects mental health so much. I had a difficult home life (home is good now, hooray) and school was my escape from it. What happens when children are told that they&#39;re worthless for DIFFERENT reasons? From people they&#39;ve grown to get used to, to people who they&#39;re supposed to learn from? Even though it&#39;s never said in front of a student, the implications are there! This leads to suicide, mental illness, violence (shooting may be involved in some countries), drug usage, and overall carelessness of wellbeing. They might as well be endorsing it at this rate! Bullies, school shooters, young gangsters, abused children, and overall, young aspiring people are having their hopes and lives thrown in a bin because of other people&#39;s failures. They&#39;re all people, we&#39;re all people, and yet the school system thinks we&#39;re a statistic. We are people, not a number. We can&#39;t be expected to be perfect, we all need support, because we&#39;re all humans. I just wish the schools could consider the effect on the future generations, this can and will affect the world for the worse. Peer support &gt; Peer pressure."
2Yt6raj-S1M,Exactly I agree 😣
2Yt6raj-S1M,This is what I think each time but actually good formulation
2Yt6raj-S1M,"True, but i feel i can’t do this idk why"
2Yt6raj-S1M,@Javier  i didn&#39;t understand what you said
2Yt6raj-S1M,"If you wanna do something cool, exciting and new, just take the words of famous meme man Shia la beuf and JUST DO IT!"
2Yt6raj-S1M,"I just had my exams and for science I got a 73.5% 😭 you know what? Actually, the school <b>purposely</b> made it harder and that’s the reason why I spent 3 days crying because of scolding too!"
2Yt6raj-S1M,he slayed
2Yt6raj-S1M,this is the main reason why i hate homeworks
2Yt6raj-S1M,Just a slight change in those definitions will be marked as a mistake even though if that sentence conveys the exact same meaning that&#39;s why I hate schools .
2Yt6raj-S1M,"@Motivation 2 Advance Well, I don&#39;t see any better method for learning, than memorising stuff."
2Yt6raj-S1M,And then forget them the next day!
2Yt6raj-S1M,@Eskder I can learn anything without memorizing. but schools insists you to learn by memorizing
2Yt6raj-S1M,"School nowadays is ment for extroverts (no problem with being one though!), for people who can remember things better by listening, “well behaved students” and people who are great at remembering! <br>I’m a straight A student and even I know it’s true! <br>The only reason people are bad is because they’re tired and bored, <br>even some teachers get bored and fill in time by talking about something slightly related to the topic!<br><br>Teachers and students aren’t robots you know!"
2Yt6raj-S1M,And school does nothing about it
2Yt6raj-S1M,"@1k challenge with 0 videos I think you and me had the same science teacher, my science teacher hated me, she tried to put me in detention because someone stole my backpack, and she called me a waste of space. I emailed the principal and he forwarded it to someone else, and it eventually got to the top. She got fired, and I was happy"
2Yt6raj-S1M,Not me
2Yt6raj-S1M,Let my peers make fun of me . Let them .
2Yt6raj-S1M,O KADAR DOĞRUKİ...
2Yt6raj-S1M,"That is not a good idea. Listen, you have to put them through school and expect some grades, but, BUT, you shouldnt penalize them if they get bad grades, reward them if they get good grades, and make it so they dont think that everything in their life is about good grades. Also second graders shouldnt be planning their life ahead of them"
2Yt6raj-S1M,Good luck with that :)

2Yt6raj-S1M,Learning is different from memorizing things which is what is important for you to pass.
2Yt6raj-S1M,"the point he makes about the &quot;inteligence drop&quot; i will say it&#39;s invalid, for the following reason, the social structure of school, he says something on the lines that &quot;i got rejected with the people of my age, but got a lot of atention of kids that are younger than me&quot; dude, the kid who&#39;s younger than you look at you like you are some kind of hero, the kid who is equal in age or older, perceives you as weird, or maybe as superior, so they try to drop you down. The second point is basically that they are people who&#39;s company value is lower than yours but studied in better universities, in this world noone is made the same, so you can&#39;t just use it like is some kind of fact (sorry for my grammar)"

2Yt6raj-S1M,"@Raptor The Bearded Dragon I hate my Physics teacher with a passion when it comes to forgiveness, but she’s right: laziness is efficient."
2Yt6raj-S1M,Schools speak about stuff of how you should get better grades and that laziness isn’t rewarded. They’re pushing you to do all their pretentious work.
2Yt6raj-S1M,Me and Asian who doesn’t understand math: uhm anyways so
2Yt6raj-S1M,After that scene I suddenly entered to comment session to check this 😂😂😂🤣 th at was  hilarious 🤚💀💀🔪
2Yt6raj-S1M,"This does not change the fact that in Australia there are 48 million kangaroos and in Uruguay there are 3,457,380 inhabitants. So if the kangaroos decide to invade Uruguay, each Uruguayan will have to fight 14 kangaroos."
2Yt6raj-S1M,Yeah lol
2Yt6raj-S1M,That one must’ve just hit him different lmao.
2Yt6raj-S1M,"Hold up, what?"
2Yt6raj-S1M,you can start now;)
2Yt6raj-S1M,"Exactly. There are TONS of biased teachers, because it&#39;s impossible to not be biased! Bias may be OK in some circumstances, but NOT in classrooms, among influential children. ATP we need to mask students so that teachers actually grade them fairly."
2Yt6raj-S1M,"That&#39;s so true! I&#39;m generally an average student, but I make sure to be extra nice to specific teachers and make them feel like they are useful to me, it really works for your grades. But then I can&#39;t do that with the actual examiners! So school is teaching me how to flirt with a teacher and not how to understand the material."
2Yt6raj-S1M,"I had amazing teachers throughout elementary school who were amazing teachers, they taught me well, and I loved school. When I got into high school I had a couple teachers who seemed to only teach for the sake of our passing. I didn&#39;t enjoy nor learn from those classes. I both enjoyed and learned from the classes with teachers who actually wanted to teach. not for the sake of our passing, but for the sake of us learning new things."
2Yt6raj-S1M,i like my teachers except the math and geography ones. they are too strict
2Yt6raj-S1M,Yeah my maths teacher said this few days ago just cus some students failed a mini test .He said:&quot;You might say that oh im gonna study harder and ur gonna see my grades fly high! No you are not going to even if u do cus i remember what my coach said that if you can&#39;t win a small competition you can&#39;t win the big one&quot; like bruh so that means what my other teachers said to not give up and study harder and perservere is all wasted now plus basically also demotivating the people who failed. Its literally asking them to fail even more wtf😂
2Yt6raj-S1M,exactly i felt like he was mad at the speaker or something wrong with that dude for sure!
2Yt6raj-S1M,@Sean Arhani i am literally 5 years younger than you OwO
2Yt6raj-S1M,&quot;Dreams dont have to be professions&quot; :))
2Yt6raj-S1M,"Developing a passion takes time. You can start now. Do Journaling maybe. Do what you like to do. It doesn&#39;t have to be one thing. By doing what you like you WILL sooner or later find what you really like. You might also realize that what you liked before actually doesn&#39;t suit you well. That&#39;s not bad, you will find something else and are now even closer to finding your passion. Don&#39;t give up bro and don&#39;t underestimate consistency."
2Yt6raj-S1M,I think you would like Mark Marson&#39;s blogs. You will have some answers to these problems
2Yt6raj-S1M,All i think is<br>E
2Yt6raj-S1M,Damn I can&#39;t even remember what I learned a day ago I have such terrible memory
2Yt6raj-S1M,İ was studying 2 or 3 hours ago and i realised that i forgot everything༎ຶ‿༎ຶ
2Yt6raj-S1M,Nope
2Yt6raj-S1M,Nope &amp; I got 94% in the previous exam!
2Yt6raj-S1M,I hope you can make your dream happen!
2Yt6raj-S1M,I once told my 4th grade teacher about people bullying me and she referred me to the counselor for being too &quot;sensitive&quot;
2Yt6raj-S1M,I love dragons too. <br>Write books about dragons!
2Yt6raj-S1M,"hey, don&#39;t quit. Instead, become the next book to blow like harry potter, just write whatever!"
2Yt6raj-S1M,"And teachers are part of schools, so school does produce less smart studenrs"
2Yt6raj-S1M,@ROM LUNDY what you&#39;re talking about was more than 30 years ago what i&#39;m talking about is this century; so it is true.
2Yt6raj-S1M,"I wish that was the way things worked... even if you get f&#39;s but are going after a certain career, you wont get hired, well, because, you got f&#39;s"

2Yt6raj-S1M,@Gustavo Souza Rodrigues lol
2Yt6raj-S1M,"@Т1000 Youtube Yeah, it&#39;s been going on for generations and generations - school isn&#39;t going to change. Education has become such a big part of society, that likewise any big thing, people will hesitate to make changes to it."
2Yt6raj-S1M,"Their parents were when schools just began, they didn&#39;t know what they actually were, teachers told our grandparents schools are amazing, they told our parents that they are flawless and its just them, and now, that&#39;s kind of the thing"
2Yt6raj-S1M,"As a brazilian, I&#39;ve maxed out the english language through chronic online procastination, this is despite the fact that english is teached in public schools here in Brazil, this is how much school sucks."

2Yt6raj-S1M,"i learned abt 50 from youtube, 25 from my own research, 20 from random research, and 5 from school"

2Yt6raj-S1M,"I&#39;m disappointed at the people who dont wanna be a gen z because we Z are in the stickest situation trying to solve these annoying warmings, and old people trying to feel copy, Jesus. Trying to take over a country, That&#39;s simply none of our business to be true, Schools aren&#39;t the same or haven&#39;t changed only the winners get to interpret their POV in history books, math is just numbers. If you don&#39;t like this era go back to baby boomers."
2Yt6raj-S1M,no they are💀
2Yt6raj-S1M,@Oliver Jasinski lol being on any generation doesn&#39;t really mean anything

2Yt6raj-S1M,this !
2Yt6raj-S1M,"A lot of this is related to low wages, a lack of resources, and minimal freedom. Advocate for teachers to actually get what they need to teach and that will change. Most people want to be able to properly do their jobs. Especially people who work in fields that focus solely on benefiting society."
2Yt6raj-S1M,@Dominic Dominic your school is sociopathic lmao
2Yt6raj-S1M,my english teacher told me that the school tells her to ignore the &quot;bad&quot; kids and just focus on the good students
2Yt6raj-S1M,True
2Yt6raj-S1M,"@김종인 아내 Thank you very much. I enjoy writing. I just don&#39;t really see a &quot;Successful future&quot; for me on this hobby of mine. But again, Thank you for your kind words. I really needed that."

2Yt6raj-S1M,@ROM LUNDY CAP
2Yt6raj-S1M,​@Melody Kim Then they put the blame on you for &quot;not studying enough!&quot; and &quot;not looking at it on your own time!&quot;... Who would when it&#39;s something that you aren&#39;t interested in.
2Yt6raj-S1M,@Amry P. You are right
2Yt6raj-S1M,"There are lot of intelligence type, from music to memorizing..."
2Yt6raj-S1M,@moonrya Yes teachers need to think like that
2Yt6raj-S1M,"SKULLCRUSHER This! Most teacher think a student has &#39;physical intelligence&#39; (like being extremely good at math or English) but they&#39;re wrong, there&#39;s emotional intelligence and more. Teachers need to realise that there is more than one type of intelligence out there"
2Yt6raj-S1M,Yeah rorke&#39;s drift
2Yt6raj-S1M,Dang okay (wait most of sabaton&#39;s songs are inspired by battles?)
2Yt6raj-S1M,The only important things that we learned from school are the abc&#39;s the 123&#39;s the additions subtractions multiplications divisions
2Yt6raj-S1M,Now his 21 but he was 16 when he did this speech
2Yt6raj-S1M,Haha this is true because a lot of schools expect you to have the knowledge of something embedded. When it comes to job hunting it’s experience mostly. Your own experience is what your going to make most out of. School is kinda hindering your own scientific brains.
2Yt6raj-S1M,"@Т1000 Youtube That may apply to some things, but when something is forced into your brain until the point that it causes mental pain, your brain forces you to forget it. This is essentially the same reason people with PTSD tend to forget some details of their traumatic event."
2Yt6raj-S1M,"Actually it&#39;s not you forgetting it, it&#39;s your brain learning to understand the flaws of school, which is like, every third person&#39;s brain"
2Yt6raj-S1M,Yes and fun fact that one of our teacher tells the same sentences over and over. One time we counted it it was 8 times of telling the same sentence with no other sentence btw.
2Yt6raj-S1M,"In my opinion, imagine if mathematics was taught along with it&#39;s history and origin. Like why does it happen, why do we do it this way. etc."
2Yt6raj-S1M,"I hope you find someone who understands that your different, but in a good way. Dyslexia can be hard. Not from personal experience. More from reading Percy Jackson. :D"
2Yt6raj-S1M,<b>Hugs</b>
2Yt6raj-S1M,"Yeah, at this point me and my friend just took that tests are the goal, not the knowledge, atleast I don&#39;t have the stacked tiredness feeling anymore, he got hit harder. The amount of times I wanted to kill myself starting from middle kindergarten is so high, but, I knew that my parents are coming in 10 minutes and they can&#39;t see me exploding with insanity if I want to have atleast a bit of fun in life ever again. It became worse untill I became a person that does everything that others say, my friend&#39;s school became alot of times more difficult in the course of a month, we chat through online chat thing and he said that he had 4 hours of sleep most of the time. He&#39;s from different country btw<br><br>The edit: I made a mistake when writing"
2Yt6raj-S1M,"@suanny. they give that much stress to make you a stronger person in the society cause world does not looks like what it is when we are unde the shadow of our parents. I know that the pressure of work is very high but just think that , by commenting if something could happen., it would have taken place already.,the school authorities does not care about the students  point of view for the  school."
2Yt6raj-S1M,"@PS trust me, i study and i get good grades. that doesn&#39;t mean school is good. yes, education is important, but why do schools feel the need to assign so much homework and stress students with the thought of &quot;what if i fail&quot; or &quot;i&#39;m never going to get into a good college.&quot;"
2Yt6raj-S1M,Not everything is negative in school. Its just your point of view because you don&#39;t want to study.
2Yt6raj-S1M,@herhangi birisi cefayı biz çekiyoruz :/
2Yt6raj-S1M,i easily can
2Yt6raj-S1M,You know what.<br>Agree
2Yt6raj-S1M,Expecting “straight As” yet the teacher them self is only good at one subject which is the one they’re  teaching
2Yt6raj-S1M,And if your doing good in the class they expect do be perfect and good all the time.
2Yt6raj-S1M,I KNOW RIGHT
2Yt6raj-S1M,i agree dude
2Yt6raj-S1M,😏
2Yt6raj-S1M,Yes true why math had to be so complicated
2Yt6raj-S1M,Lol i understand maths.
2Yt6raj-S1M,Same :(
2Yt6raj-S1M,Same!
2Yt6raj-S1M,Are you challenging me? I sont even understand fractions
2Yt6raj-S1M,are you challenging me??!!!!
2Yt6raj-S1M,Lol you made my day
2Yt6raj-S1M,So uh I guess this is where the asian people gather?
2Yt6raj-S1M,"@I MP I mean, you as a scientist would agree that most schools  focus on  &quot;memorization&quot;  and you as a scientist also realize how that is moot. What is important is to figure out the right information from a sea of information and not get side tracked. I don&#39;t deny that school does have a few merits but those merits get moot when bad teachers don&#39;t really care about teaching. Unfortunately, these bad teachers are everywhere. Secondly, the problem with school is if a kid learns how to gather credible sources, not to get sidetracked...he can virtually be good at anything. But, we&#39;re not taught that in school. Now, of course, I don&#39;t have too much of a problem with school...but I do feel we need to take measures to improve this..."
2Yt6raj-S1M,Finally found a teacher who understand our pain🤝
2Yt6raj-S1M,@adriano dicostanzo i agree but that only the top idk less than 1%
2Yt6raj-S1M,@David Anderson this is why he is a college professor now. college profs are chads
2Yt6raj-S1M,@Cohline Garnet you said most students forget what they sudied for the exams. But what are you basing that assumption on?
2Yt6raj-S1M,* around 4 years
2Yt6raj-S1M,You can&#39;t teach creativity
2Yt6raj-S1M,From 22k people
2Yt6raj-S1M,I dont know what you are saying but congrats on the last comment in the comments section
2Yt6raj-S1M,"If life gave you a chance, go a head and pick it up. But if you do not have any choice it is better for you to complete your education."
2Yt6raj-S1M,But I believe that schools do not improve intelligent as the same time it is obligatory for who didn&#39;t have chance.
2Yt6raj-S1M,What did you write
2Yt6raj-S1M,"@Tully Exactly, I wish teachers taught us things that would be useful for our future."
2Yt6raj-S1M,"This type of effect was the same for me in English, every single year we had to do poetry. I am fine with poetry, but doing it every year isn&#39;t really...helpful? Poetry should be taught for the younger years at least."
2Yt6raj-S1M,@Tully like why they&#39;re hard enough on their own
2Yt6raj-S1M,I knew something wasn&#39;t right the moment they mixed numbers with letters
2Yt6raj-S1M,"Yeah, can&#39;t they make it like 2% longer to explain but actually so we can remember and not just forget in like a week because the way they teach is a 1080x1890p image that consists of 3 pixels and the brain needs to somehow compress, atleast make it in a way that brain decides it&#39;s worth to compress and not just throw it out"
2Yt6raj-S1M,@sleepyhead thank you i forgot nerds :)
2Yt6raj-S1M,And nerds
2Yt6raj-S1M,Find something you love to do

2Yt6raj-S1M,YOOOOO
2Yt6raj-S1M,I learned the Dutch language from my dad and after 8 years of school I still can’t count to ten in French
2Yt6raj-S1M,@Christian Dominguez I feel like school is kind of a let done since you can’t really decide what you want to learn for example: I love doing drama but I despise French class
2Yt6raj-S1M,"i think school is important but it&#39;s up to parents to teach them personally things their kids won&#39;t learn in school. in this way , their kids can improve their creativity while going through the limitations school offers."
2Yt6raj-S1M,@Aubrey Apple Yeah! And Vsauce and TED-ED too.
2Yt6raj-S1M,tru daat
2Yt6raj-S1M,@Vedant Sridhar Kurzgesagt-in a nutshell is really good👏💜

2Yt6raj-S1M,"Well of course not, you didn&#39;t say please."
2Yt6raj-S1M,wait same like this happens to me just a month ago there were more than a dozen activities and also our periodic test was going on and also extra revisions the same like this happened many times I always thought today I will do the thing I love but there is always some school work I love drawing and making paper and clay models as well as do some extra science experiments but all of them demolished and not just some months but a whole complete year I am truly happy as now we have nothing but just waiting for a month for the final exam I drawed am anime character and made a tiny paper funko pop I felt so happy doing a thing like this in such a long time
2Yt6raj-S1M,I&#39;m sorry.
2Yt6raj-S1M,“I’m sorry little one” -Thanos 2018
2Yt6raj-S1M,@John Hardin sadly true
2Yt6raj-S1M,same I only had a few teachers that actually know how to speak english (I speak spanish)
2Yt6raj-S1M,I know what you mean.
2Yt6raj-S1M,"Exactly, I as a native german speaker learned about the same amount of english in 1 year of watching english youtube-videos and movies than I have in 10 years of school. And most of the time it was because I actually wanted to learn english and not because I was forced to. Believe it or not, but you learn a lot better, when the information is not forced down your throat, for you to forget it in a week anyway..."
2Yt6raj-S1M,"LOL Yea IKR like i learned English so perfectly even if it wasn&#39;t my first language I learned it from &quot;nO gLue SliMe tUtOriAlS&quot; etc at the age of 6. And my mom tried SOOO hard to stop me but, no no no, I carried on. And yea, here I am having more knowledge than most of my relatives and teachers even tho I&#39;m VERY VERY young."
2Yt6raj-S1M,Thx
2Yt6raj-S1M,Tnx I needed it

2Yt6raj-S1M,Me!
2Yt6raj-S1M,geometry laughing in the background
2Yt6raj-S1M,@Mohammad Shafiul Amin Bhuiyan honestly!! And then it&#39;s even harder because rich people do not like &quot;poor&quot; people getting rich.
2Yt6raj-S1M,@Carlet Vunnis Yeah a guidance for a well paid job! anything unrelated to industries are neglected.
2Yt6raj-S1M,"School is just a guidance it’s you to figure out how to use it, it’s all up to you, school only show you the way, and you’re the one who’s going to walk ahead the way"
2Yt6raj-S1M,This is 100% rea- i mean 1000000000000000000% real
2Yt6raj-S1M,"That&#39;s so bad! My dad is a teacher ans my mum has teacher education but is a document manager, imagine going to gramma when you&#39;re like 5 and her being just like parents, I would&#39;ve jumped off a building"
2Yt6raj-S1M,"@Kebo Vargas huh, oh yeah"
2Yt6raj-S1M,"@Kebo Vargas yeah, tell me about it, just getting good grades are hard but in the end they don&#39;t even matter, no wonder the most successful people are dropouts"
2Yt6raj-S1M,"Or maybe just redo schooling all together<br>Offer many many optional courses that people can go to if they want, so they can choose how much they want to spend studying each day and actually get interested"
2Yt6raj-S1M,oh my gosh yes that would be a dream yo
2Yt6raj-S1M,"Ppl on phones with subtitles on: no<br><br>(I don&#39;t mean to offend, just to give a laugh)"
2Yt6raj-S1M,Well if school really succeeded at making me intelligent I wouldn’t be crying because of all the stress it gives me . Not to mention half of my language skills and general knowledge comes from the internet so yeah . You’re right sChOoL mADe mE iNtElliGent 🤡

2Yt6raj-S1M,@bobody It is a bit cliche and wierd.
2Yt6raj-S1M,@bobody Good point.
2Yt6raj-S1M,"@Arianna Seguin so basically what your saying is, only kids with failing grades are able to like the comment? What&#39;s up with that logic. Plus, no student who has high grades ever brags about it, that&#39;s cliche and weird."
2Yt6raj-S1M,@bobody nerds
2Yt6raj-S1M,@bobody The students with high grades that brag about their high grades.
2Yt6raj-S1M,"@Boring Gaming u still need ambition and talent. The kid has a point, but people here are making it sound like ur gonna be fine not going to school just because a couple celebrities didn&#39;t and they got lucky.

2Yt6raj-S1M,So true
2Yt6raj-S1M,"yeah, school is meant to teach you the basics of a subject and make you practice it<br>but they&#39;re just wasting your time by teaching you stuff you&#39;ll forget in a day"

2Yt6raj-S1M,The only thing it really teaches me is math and history. Like these weird equations I might need to know if I’m an accountant. Trivia probably wouldn’t be a thing if you didn’t have to go to school 😂😅

2Yt6raj-S1M,Only thing i remember is the abc&#39;s
2Yt6raj-S1M,"That&#39;s the problem. Not everyone wants to learn how to edit yt videos. Not everyone wants to learn algebra. The education system is the way it is for historical reasons. The way it always was.<br><br>Internet is a farely new factor despite being a huge one. Younger people adapt to many things easier. Times change. Therefore the subjects that have been useful 100 years ago are not all that useful now.<br><br>I personally think that it won&#39;t take too many years for this to change. I mean it&#39;s changing all the time, because it has to. What use is all the fascinating new technology if no one knows how to use it?"
2Yt6raj-S1M,And that&#39;s where reading others stories kicks in. -School

2Yt6raj-S1M,Hey bro some guys have a genuine interest in history<br>but yeah they really only want grades from us
2Yt6raj-S1M,"History&#39;s my favorite tbh but It&#39;s true, School is just about Grades"
2Yt6raj-S1M,Personally I think history is one of the best classes compared to my English class I have right now where my online teacher is just giving us random essays to write with out teaching us a single thing in 3 months.
2Yt6raj-S1M,It is often said that only 40% of what we learn in school is used in everyday life in the real world.
2Yt6raj-S1M,Some adults: <b>wut?</b>
2Yt6raj-S1M,how can you learn from jake paul<br><br>also i guess the only thing jake pauls father didnt do as a mistake was not make a mistake because that mistake is jake paul
2Yt6raj-S1M,"so by not making mistakes, i make the biggest mistake? wait so that counts right? XD"

2Yt6raj-S1M,"Oh hey look, it’s nagito komeada on the Nintendo ds"
2Yt6raj-S1M,"But you need to be pretty good at math if you do. When you design clothes and possibly make them, you have to insert how long the fabric is going to be in certain parts, how it&#39;s going to fit together, costs of materials, profit, etc. <br>soooooooo good luck on that 0-0"
2Yt6raj-S1M,"OMG, can we be friends, I want to be a fashion designer too :D"
2Yt6raj-S1M,Yes I ?eel you
2Yt6raj-S1M,@AFatTaco The truth is school is a failed experiment conducted by the government to compel people to go through years upon years of studying a particular field and eventually use them for academic purposes.
2Yt6raj-S1M,Taco Maro bruh
2Yt6raj-S1M,"Ostrich Yes speaking of school teaching people nothing, your spelling"
2Yt6raj-S1M,"@yes i&#39;ve found that you will encounter this phenomenon  in any given field as you learn more. I&#39;m  a sophomore in college studying Bio (although I studied music my freshman year lol). The reason they don&#39;t go into more depth in high school is that a lot of people aren&#39;t smart enough and it would take too long to explain it to them.   And I don&#39;t mean that in a negative way, different people are good at different things."
2Yt6raj-S1M,LMFAOO I REMEMBER THIS

2Yt6raj-S1M,"Taco Maro there is the app called the AnkiApp, you can study pretty much anything, you go to the search and put in Japanese and it shows you all of the options. I recommend getting introduced to Japanese before you study tho, because it might be confusing there are three alphabets."

2Yt6raj-S1M,"@Cian Linehan Those are just “steps”,  not “changes”"
2Yt6raj-S1M,"I disagree but whatever. Yes, some people such as Henry Ford changed the world that way, but so many people have changed the world by doing was “the world” told them to do. I mean the Apollo missions changed the world. Besides who even is the world? Assuming it’s government, which government? If it’s the US government then what do u know, NASAs sending astronauts to Mars in the 2030s. That’ll change the world. I mean humans will be a interplanetary species then. Yay."

2Yt6raj-S1M,Most underrated comment!!
2Yt6raj-S1M,What school wants to teach us: How to be smart and be big brain!<br><br>What school actually teaches us: How to repeat and rewrite
2Yt6raj-S1M,@Raihan Safi same here
2Yt6raj-S1M,"@Raihan Safi How old are you though. Yes the Math basics are important. But it SHOULDN&#39;T be hard. Because what&#39;s the purpose of making it hard if we can&#39;t even use it for our everyday lives? Math is fine and useful, but we should just learn the important parts, not the hard and useless ones (Like algebra, it&#39;s a messy tricky part of Math, but is so useless like wtf just teach me how to pay taxes)"

2Yt6raj-S1M,It doesnt really convey rebellion if you know how to understand lol but ok

2Yt6raj-S1M,@Speed Mize yo teachers are trained to do that. Just because you are frustrated by your job doesn&#39;t mean you would throw that frustration on kids.
2Yt6raj-S1M,Damn same. My math teacher discriminated students on the basis of their looks like tf hon
2Yt6raj-S1M,"If thats the case then i would tell the principal or even sue the teacher for behaving like that, because children needs to be creative, innovative, and positive thinkers. and that one teacher will always bring them down, that is just not right. teachers like that just want your money, they dont want to teach you new found knowlege, im sorry that you have to go through that bud"
2Yt6raj-S1M,"The fact that the same thing happened to me...LOL. My math teacher said &quot; you can never understand this&quot; and I SWEAR that was the first time I took an interest during math class but, I lost it all. This TED TALK SHOULD BE LISTENED BY EVERYONE AND SHOULD BE UNDERSTOOD BY EVERYONE, ESPECIALLY SCHOOLS AND PARENTS, AND THEY SHOULD ACCEPT THIS THAT YES SCHOOLS MAKES KIDS LESS INTELLIGENT."
2Yt6raj-S1M,"@Leemabari Beage Wtf dud, I have high grades man, and I love school. Dude not everyone hates school bro. They give us education and a chance to prove were better than others. Bro chill, ur wrong XD"
2Yt6raj-S1M,"HAHAHA, yes ur on point"
2Yt6raj-S1M,Me with kinda high grades who liked this: o-o
2Yt6raj-S1M,"I&#39;ve got high grades, and honestly I feel bad for the people who are looked down upon just because they can&#39;t remember the exact definition to a word they&#39;re never gonna use. There&#39;s also another thing I don&#39;t get; when we do review games, the team who wins gets extra points on their test. What?!?!! That&#39;s like giving glasses to someone with perfect vision.<br>And I can&#39;t tell you how many times I&#39;ve gotten 105% on a test or something crazy like that just because my half of the room has slightly better memory than the other half."
2Yt6raj-S1M,I get mostly over average grades and I liked this.
2Yt6raj-S1M,Same
2Yt6raj-S1M,i absolutely agree hun
2Yt6raj-S1M,@The Piano Peep same. I struggle to face everyone. Even by the thoughts of asking a one SINGLE question makes me feel anxious.
2Yt6raj-S1M,"a teacher doesn&#39;t just teach. they also learn and study just like the rest of us. and while you could argue that most of the time the teachers study one or a few subjects, they have to do a lot more work in order to actually be able to teach us."
2Yt6raj-S1M,"School causes extreme stress and sleep deprivation. In fact, I already have social anxiety and depression, making it even more challenging for me to survive each day."
2Yt6raj-S1M,"Students could build up depression, anxiety, stress, and fear."
2Yt6raj-S1M,"teachers are near experts on the subject. they dont expect us to be experts on the subject, but to know the stuff. even if youre doing some basic cleaning and add water to acid instead of vice versa, you could get seriously burnt. if you studied chemistry in school, you likely wouldnt have gotten injured. im also pretty sure that all the teachers know the basics of other subjects which they undoubtedly learnt in school too."
2Yt6raj-S1M,Sebastian Haraldsson I know so many people with degrees but are struggling to find a good job
2Yt6raj-S1M,And it still does
2Yt6raj-S1M,"@dailydose ofoofs yes, and school students Can&#39;t study while having pressure."
2Yt6raj-S1M,@Zhitheアスリート  Yeah
2Yt6raj-S1M,@dailydose ofoofs but it takes time to be used to it
2Yt6raj-S1M,Well some people learn better under pressure...<br><br>some
2Yt6raj-S1M,F
2Yt6raj-S1M,@Sairaj karad 😂😂bruh
2Yt6raj-S1M,We still need school <br>Since some of those doors the guy&#39;s talking about are provided by school finishing school <br>Sorry my English is bad
2Yt6raj-S1M,"what we can expect?<br>parents: this video opened my eyes, now i gonna get my money back.<br>they are making our children less intelligent.<br><br>😂"
2Yt6raj-S1M,To be fair what did you expect
2Yt6raj-S1M,.
2Yt6raj-S1M,OH
2Yt6raj-S1M,"Yeah, but its the truth. The world works that way and its flawed but we alone can&#39;t change it"
2Yt6raj-S1M,After like 2 minutes
2Yt6raj-S1M,Haha i get it
2Yt6raj-S1M,I know right...
2Yt6raj-S1M,Me!!!
2Yt6raj-S1M,@Human &quot;I really do&quot; means &quot;I really do think I&#39;m the only Asian who doesn&#39;t understand math&quot;
2Yt6raj-S1M,yes. we can acually sleep for once
2Yt6raj-S1M,@John Doe yea that&#39;s true
2Yt6raj-S1M,Ik. My eyebags are halfway down my face
2Yt6raj-S1M,"Human I thought he said, “I really do,” as in, he really does think that he’s the only Asian kid who’s bad at math. It seems like it could be taken multiple ways."
2Yt6raj-S1M,Lol
2Yt6raj-S1M,"@useless secondary account exactly. I go to a private school, while it is slightly better I guess than public schools they care more about profit and how much money they can make off of us instead of actually teaching us."
2Yt6raj-S1M,That&#39;s a nice teacher you have.
2Yt6raj-S1M,@Abeeha Hassan I usually don&#39;t like these memes but this is a very good one!! Lol.
2Yt6raj-S1M,Life’s A Animation lolo
2Yt6raj-S1M,@Simulping are you from Indonesia
2Yt6raj-S1M,"Exactly my first language is English (and im a Half chinese and Half Bidayu girl who lives in Malaysia) and i learn words from my family of course but also becuz of movies, tv shows, internet, youtube etc"
2Yt6raj-S1M,I can tell you that 80% of what I learned was from my parents and the sad sad 20% goes to the schools.
2Yt6raj-S1M,same situation here
2Yt6raj-S1M,@Mariam saghir we live the same lives
2Yt6raj-S1M,@Mariam saghir youre good here
2Yt6raj-S1M,@chris kay I honestly want to adapt that. I really want to say no but my upbringing and social anxiety ( which I have to hide) unfortunately never allows me too. It just feels weird saying no to an elder.
2Yt6raj-S1M,@Mariam saghir if u get told to do sum don&#39;t. If your asked to consider it.<br>Thats my mental.on it
2Yt6raj-S1M,I feel u😔
2Yt6raj-S1M,"@Mariam saghir I have LITERALLY the same experience as you. In fact, I was in such a messy situation last year cuz of this. My English teacher told me she wanted me to participate in a mime play but I told her that I already had many other events that clashed with it. She wasn&#39;t ready to accept that and insisted that I come. So, on the next day when I was called for practice for the mime, I did not go. I even saw my teacher walk past me. I looked into her eyes and proceeded to do what I was doing. Apparently she told my mom she felt hurt about my behaviour. I apologised but was upset that she did not care if I overworked myself"
2Yt6raj-S1M,Me too but sadly we can&#39;t..:(
2Yt6raj-S1M,@KirillL oh i am in my senior high school year .so duh i have to sleep from 12 am to 4 am -_- (we have tests everyday)
2Yt6raj-S1M,@Woodchain maybe it&#39;s &quot;at home&quot; but let&#39;s put that aside . U think that u learned it at ur home but the truth to be told u learned it at school.just think about it deeply u will find it
2Yt6raj-S1M,@Woodchain u wouldn&#39;t be able to comment me back if u didn&#39;t went to school
2Yt6raj-S1M,@Ice Cubes and they taught u that because they went to school
2Yt6raj-S1M,"@Woodchain without school u wouldn&#39;t had friends and without friends no video game. without school no computer or internet or anything like it  would be here. So,we must thanks  all the physicists!"
2Yt6raj-S1M,I learned more from youtube.<br>I got fluent in english by watching cartoons and movies..<br>I learned about astronomy (which i&#39;m pretty interested) on youtube more<br>I learned about guns (i&#39;m quite interested about the history of gund) more in youtube<br>I learned about history more in youtube..<br><br>Modern school sucks.
2Yt6raj-S1M,I like to write stories or draw art. Yet after i drew something the teacher says &quot;eW dOn&#39;T dRaW (write) tHat DRaW sOmeThinG eLsE&quot; which obviously destroys the kid&#39;s creativity and freedom to imagine
2Yt6raj-S1M,"Not really, modern school sucks"
2Yt6raj-S1M,"we dont need more holidays, we need a better school system"
2Yt6raj-S1M,"@Kareem Magar Yas Kwane hit it lets make this world a better place, and lets start with u"
2Yt6raj-S1M,wish*
2Yt6raj-S1M,yeah sh i could shake your hands !!
2Yt6raj-S1M,facts !!!!!!
2Yt6raj-S1M,@Kareem Magar what happened ?
2Yt6raj-S1M,"There was only one time where I got to write a piece<br><br>I had to write my own ending to the story of a story she had us read, but when I showed it to the teacher, she didn’t like it.<br><br>So from what I’d gathered by the story, there was a woman, and she lived with the ghost of her husband. And that one time she goes to a party and dances with some dude.<br><br>So I thought, what if the ghost gets mad and curses his wife to starve to death in her own house with the guy she danced with?<br><br>But the teacher said it was strange because &quot;wouldn’t the ghost be jealous?&quot;<br><br>And they never asked me to write a story ever again."
2Yt6raj-S1M,"Don’t let these things hold you down and diminish your desire! There’s so many other people out there who want to become fictional writers, including myself. Writing truly is a mesmerizing practice, but schools don’t always endorse the more creative and explorational side of it, which certainly is depressing. Write on the side if you don’t have time. Two sentences is more than nothing, even if they are just scribbled in a notebook!"
2Yt6raj-S1M,"You can still do it. I come from one of the top schools (with a crazy high standard for excellence and passing grades) in my country and I still write whenever I have the time. It&#39;s not too late, my dude!"
2Yt6raj-S1M,write by yourself! You don&#39;t need school telling you how to write
2Yt6raj-S1M,"useless man I have been taught how to write fiction in previous grades, so I don’t know what you’re talking about. Since you’re saying “primary school”, I assume you mean elementary school where I live, and I am pass that grade"
2Yt6raj-S1M,"Yep, grades aren&#39;t always everything. It depends on the kid&#39;s creativity and stuff. getting bad grades but not cheating is ok."
2Yt6raj-S1M,Same bro
2Yt6raj-S1M,"@HDB Animates/Film yes, yes it does"
2Yt6raj-S1M,"No, we have free speech"
2Yt6raj-S1M,exactly he&#39;s spoiled that he got lucky that a businessman invested in him and now he thinks that school isn&#39;t important
2Yt6raj-S1M,It could be. A teacher that destroys a single kid&#39;s creativity or freedom to imagine is a teacher i hate
2Yt6raj-S1M,For your school yeah. For my school no
2Yt6raj-S1M,@Charles Wolfanger Umm ... no?
2Yt6raj-S1M,Saved?
2Yt6raj-S1M,AI
2Yt6raj-S1M,"@Yes No yeah jarvis, iron man,  marvel?"
2Yt6raj-S1M,@Advait My girl friend learn 6 hours a day to get same good grades as I have while playing LoL and working on a village most of time
2Yt6raj-S1M,Cause money
2Yt6raj-S1M,Because the teachers are lying
2Yt6raj-S1M,"Yes. The special ones are taught the same way, and since everyone is taught the same way, everyone is special.<br>(That’s obviously a joke, but it could be how they think)"
2Yt6raj-S1M,"Yoy Piur the system was not built for learning, we were just brainwashed to think so. This so called attempt is doing more harm than good"
2Yt6raj-S1M,"@Samridh Banerjee  yeah, i just sigh but immediately begin to mad because of that"
2Yt6raj-S1M,parents as well
2Yt6raj-S1M,So true

2Yt6raj-S1M,Too bad I could only like your comment once
2Yt6raj-S1M,The 1kth like
2Yt6raj-S1M,"that&#39;s a fact but do you know why it&#39;s said.?<br>Its because the colleges in austria teaching lessons in a test-focussed method,which was making einstein mad because physics were not discussed just told so."
2Yt6raj-S1M,wow
2Yt6raj-S1M,"Well, if you become an economist, if start your own company,  if you become a math teacher, if you become a architect. And so on.  Quite many jobs that requires advanced math."
2Yt6raj-S1M,@Spyth AHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHA omg XD
2Yt6raj-S1M,"School: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Yt6raj-S1M&amp;t=3m07s"">3:07</a>"

2Yt6raj-S1M,"if what you mean by &quot;mocking&quot; is <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Yt6raj-S1M&amp;t=7m23s"">7:23</a> then you completely wrong, he is not mocking harvard graduates instead he is pointing out there is something wrong with the education system , because grade c student like him can beat harvard graduates at 16 years old."
2Yt6raj-S1M,"Well, that means quite little before you made that trillion..."
2Yt6raj-S1M,he create things with creativity not memorizing things which are basically exams
2Yt6raj-S1M,"What the video fails to mention, however, is that the work required to get a company successful is a 100 times more demanding than getting straight A&#39;s."
2Yt6raj-S1M,"Im in middle school, and i get 2-4 hrs"
2Yt6raj-S1M,"@GETPRIZE193 1 lucky, also you&#39;re supposed to be 13 for a youtube account."
2Yt6raj-S1M,@Softia lmao same.
2Yt6raj-S1M,@M Muammar what kinda 5 yr old has a YouTube account??
2Yt6raj-S1M,Edgar C. Excuse me we middle schoolers get less sleep too I get around 4-7 hours of sleep (probably cuz I’m Asian lol)
2Yt6raj-S1M,no the student doesnt
2Yt6raj-S1M,I wanted to be a criminal trial prosecutor
2Yt6raj-S1M,popimak mo sometimes social studies isn’t that important. Im just being taught about christopher Columbus when I literally studied him for weeks in total before. (just an example)
2Yt6raj-S1M,"Im a middle schooler and i get 7-8 hours of sleep i sleep at 9pm -  10 pm i dont stay till dawn<br>I know this is a meme,"
2Yt6raj-S1M,"A lot of people get up at 4 am, get home at 5 pm and then school expects them to get good grades"
2Yt6raj-S1M,&quot;the best we can do here is three. Take it or leave it&quot;
2Yt6raj-S1M,"I don&#39;t even want to go to any ivy league school, I just want to go to one of the best colleges in my state to make it cheaper. They say the better the school, the better the connections and advantages you&#39;ll have. It&#39;s times when I wonder what&#39;s the point to all this general studying that I remember comments like yours. I like studying about business but anything else, not really. They said they&#39;re bringing down test requirements for 2021 which makes me feel a little better. I just hope they&#39;ll accept me.."
2Yt6raj-S1M,"The SAT is not gonna shape your life, even if entrepreneurs went to the ivys. The majority of the ivy league people just only live paycheck to paycheck! It doesnt matter if you are smart or not!"
2Yt6raj-S1M,Please read this again. And again. And again
2Yt6raj-S1M,"Powerful. This is amasing, realizing what&#39;s wrong with the education system."

2Yt6raj-S1M,@Harshita Prasad same😂😂
2Yt6raj-S1M,"Rather the middle. You need a college education to become a teacher, the bottom cannot afford that."
2Yt6raj-S1M,Most people simply are not leaders though. And most company leaders of successful companies are quite well educated.
2Yt6raj-S1M,“So that’s where by water boiler went!”
2Yt6raj-S1M,That face should become a meme

2Yt6raj-S1M,🤣
2Yt6raj-S1M,So true 🤣
2Yt6raj-S1M,Also people say you should go to school to have friends and socialize <br><br>Teacher: “hears students talking”<br><br>Students we are not here to socialize we are here to learn 🙄
2Yt6raj-S1M,Lmao :)
2Yt6raj-S1M,"@Ronaldohere yknow what  , that&#39;s exactly what I&#39;m gonna say to my physics teacher. Ffs that women just piles work on us 🤦‍♂️"
2Yt6raj-S1M,Bobby JCFHv Lichtenstein I hate this speech unfortunately
2Yt6raj-S1M,"Cause you guys watch YouTube videos till 1am. That&#39;s not school&#39;s fault, that&#39;s yours. Nobody&#39;s stopping you from sleeping at 9pm"
2Yt6raj-S1M,"Very true, according to the NHS website though, an average 12 year old needs <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Yt6raj-S1M&amp;t=9m30s"">9:30</a>. The range for teens is 8-10hours of sleep"

2Yt6raj-S1M,your nickname
2Yt6raj-S1M,@Gan Zorig me
2Yt6raj-S1M,@David Konevky show this to her
2Yt6raj-S1M,my mother is a teacher at university and she&#39;s basically the opposite of this kid lmao
2Yt6raj-S1M,Haha my mother is a teacher too
2Yt6raj-S1M,Lol :O also my brother and my mother are Teacher too :)!!! And now they force me to be a Teacher too :))
2Yt6raj-S1M,@Lord Storm I just thought it was funny. Don&#39;t you?
2Yt6raj-S1M,What’s your point? Do you think it’s easy to speak in front of an audience like that and not make any mistakes?
2Yt6raj-S1M,I was waiting someone to say it!!
2Yt6raj-S1M,Plus they teach you the wrong primary colors in art class.
2Yt6raj-S1M,hohohoaaa well yea but sometimes the work they give us is ridiculous. 8 hours a day 5 days a week and they still give us homework. Sometimes they just gotta let a kid have their break honestly.
2Yt6raj-S1M,"i dont want to sound like a boomer but when kids play video games all day, get bad grades, and then cry and blame it on the teacher its just ridiculous"
2Yt6raj-S1M,Haha he lost his brain cells 😂
2Yt6raj-S1M,uh ok xd
2Yt6raj-S1M,"not for the kid, nor in the 3 words"
2Yt6raj-S1M,Too
2Yt6raj-S1M,By allowing them to enroll and course in classes they&#39;re legitimately interested in? Lmao.
2Yt6raj-S1M,People want creativity people want what they want most kids want want and not need
2Yt6raj-S1M,nice
2Yt6raj-S1M,Akihiko Sanada And i wonder why airplanes are allowed...
2Yt6raj-S1M,"Who&#39;s BOE?<br><br>Also, fun fact: With our ever-advancing technology, we actually can make flying cars if we wanted to! However, scientists discovered flying cars would be too dangerous for the environment and as such abandoned the concept a while ago."
2Yt6raj-S1M,Also who&#39;s watching this in 2019
2Yt6raj-S1M,Lol
2Yt6raj-S1M,@Luke Augustus this isnt anime. I wish it was tho.
2Yt6raj-S1M,Also good luck!
2Yt6raj-S1M,"@Luke Augustus That&#39;s fine<br>also same problem with me, school is severely limiting our journey onto running a business because one is committing to something you actually love doing and make a living and heck, who knows maybe a fortune<br>Meanwhile the other is commiting to something which will not serve you for your good future"
2Yt6raj-S1M,"Do not listen to the ones who will push you down. Hear me out. The problem in modern society is that to find your purpose in life is severely limited by education, they are reliant on grades rather than experience."
2Yt6raj-S1M,@hohohoaaa effort is not enough if your skills aren&#39;t good enough for some topics. High effort isn&#39;t the same as effective effort.
2Yt6raj-S1M,OFCOURSE HE DID BECAUSE HE DID THAT TO ME TOO!!!!!!
2Yt6raj-S1M,BTS here
2Yt6raj-S1M,noice xd
2Yt6raj-S1M,@Jacques life is good how about yours
2Yt6raj-S1M,What&#39;s up my guy how is your life
2Yt6raj-S1M,XD
2Yt6raj-S1M,honestly tho💀 my ideas for art class when i was little were so much better than my ideas now
2Yt6raj-S1M,Playing videogames
2Yt6raj-S1M,i think my school drained all the creativity i had left in me. even if i try to be creative i can’t
2Yt6raj-S1M,@Sandhorst wait a minute i&#39;m not american either and I really thought american schools are like super good and stuff
2Yt6raj-S1M,"Really dude? Maybe it&#39;s because I can&#39;t relate and just don&#39;t understand but each day I think about different ideas, stories, characters, and always try to look at different POVs. I&#39;m not giving myself a big pat on the back but I find it really hard to believe that you haven&#39;t thought creatively. That wasn&#39;t even what he was trying to say as well. He was saying that people should try to look at different ways to get careers, not that people are no longer creative."
2Yt6raj-S1M,"History of the entire world, I guess?"
2Yt6raj-S1M,cupofdirtfordinner I was making a joke?
2Yt6raj-S1M,@Coggers as if you don&#39;t have things to work on too.
2Yt6raj-S1M,cupofdirtfordinner looks like capitalized i&#39;s aren&#39;t the only thing you have to work on
2Yt6raj-S1M,@Coggers i was making a joke?
2Yt6raj-S1M,cupofdirtfordinner I can get that but why was any of the 16th century stuff necessary
2Yt6raj-S1M,Ok maybe some things are worth learning from school.
2Yt6raj-S1M,Well we got a meme historian so yeah
2Yt6raj-S1M,bruh xd
2Yt6raj-S1M,xD
2Yt6raj-S1M,We were born too early :(
2Yt6raj-S1M,"Imnotabot3000 Yes I wanna make new tech I have already, as a KS3 (6 to 8 grade it think )<br>Student, learnt electronics and designed a couple things and will make an expensive prototype soon."
2Yt6raj-S1M,"School isn&#39;t a failed idea, the type of system they implement for school is the failed idea. Some people have it better than other, such as Finland :("
2Yt6raj-S1M,@Jihyuu Yunnie yeah it way too slow and wasting too much time. Almost killing me.
2Yt6raj-S1M,"Briseur De Lance You don’t get the point of this video. I’ve learnt more information by watching a few videos on YouTube than a few years worth of studying in school. My biology teacher only recently got into a topic that I watched a video about 4-5 years ago, it’s unbelievable how slow they are. Plus, what’s the point of learning a bunch of stuff that’s going to be useless in the future? Sure, some things school provides could come in handy, but you could literally learn majority of the stuff on your own. You should be able to learn by yourself, about the things that will actually have an impact."

Even if it&#39;s a bit of speeding or stealing a little stone from the neighbour&#39;s yard. Completely trivial stuff, yet it breaks the law indeed. Should I even mention the nice stuff like tax avoidance and violent crime? People are not doing what the world is telling them to do, even if it makes them a criminal. Not to mention that different states, countries, etc have completely different sets of different rules. In my opinion, you need some knowledge about the reality.... And clearly not from your school or your parents."

As a Vietnamese, the only reason i can understand the American school system is because i have been in one and OH MY GOD it&#39;s soooooooo boring, i was always interested in English but that experience took almost 40% of my hope on Linguistic. I feel bad for the american when i heard about their educational system but i feel even WORSE when that happened to me.

2Yt6raj-S1M,Teexamanbinnojol that’s what’s strange some schools and students have the luck of getting unsupportive and bland teachers that don’t interact with their student and helping them learn the subject they are teaching and blame the kids for failing and making kids suffer unfairly
2Yt6raj-S1M,Karl?
2Yt6raj-S1M,lol
2Yt6raj-S1M,Same

2Yt6raj-S1M,"Sorry to hear that, man. I wish you the best. The US doesn’t have a very open education system either, but it’s probably worse there. Good luck."
2Yt6raj-S1M,Not all of them are bad
2Yt6raj-S1M,The lie we live
2Yt6raj-S1M,Caleb Saunders you could have grammatically corrected your statement but I see your point it’s not just wether or not you’re good at school it’s to deal with the fact that they set us on a one dimensional path that constricts the ability of kids to diverge and find a better path than the one already commonly set
2Yt6raj-S1M,"@chewy don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll be your friend ☺️"
2Yt6raj-S1M,@chewy same
2Yt6raj-S1M,Same bro

2Yt6raj-S1M,"JD50 eh its complicated bu simply put, old people are better"
2Yt6raj-S1M,"That makes no sense. You really need to rethink your statement, I mean really dissect it."
2Yt6raj-S1M,Erik Sivec that’s flawed I’m most cases people often reach the pinnacle of education and graduate with honors and end up in a dead end and going nowhere compared to those with a half leveled education that did their own thing and became great
2Yt6raj-S1M,"That sounds so boring though, I spend my life:<br>Working to get a good job<br>Working at a job<br>Working towards retirement<br>Finally being able to enjoy myself (If I live to 90, I spend 66% of my life span working)<br>By the point of retirement, my family has a high chance of being dead, and all my friends will have moved on to different things, so I will be old <b>and</b> alone"

2Yt6raj-S1M,Bobs Vegana You are so right.
2Yt6raj-S1M,samuel Roberts congratulations on being the most condescending person I have ever seen in the comments.
2Yt6raj-S1M,Fractions are so simple. Why do people have a problem learning them. They&#39;re also really important to understand
2Yt6raj-S1M,??
2Yt6raj-S1M,Good riddance it really needs a major overhaul
2Yt6raj-S1M,Being a child I guess makes us creative so we can think outside the box. sorry poor grammar or maybe its because 2 am aijrionfjdksfhnjdfnvm

2Yt6raj-S1M,Prince EA essentially said this. You should look it up. Its call i sued the school system or something to that affect
2Yt6raj-S1M,I just realized I changed what its about half way through     :\
2Yt6raj-S1M,"Francis Bronco B33, I feel ya it seems pointless to learn about things that you wont often use in your life but it’s good to learn about subjects like math, english, sciences ect. because understanding these subjects causes  you to view ideas and everything around you in a different light. Even if you don’t ever use subjects like science or history in your career, being a more knowledgeable person will improve your life for the better."
2Yt6raj-S1M,It must be so frustrating...
2Yt6raj-S1M,I go to a top 100 high school in the nation (ranked nationally). A kid at my school committed suicide last year. Unacceptable.

2Yt6raj-S1M,"Damn, I wish our whole class could rebel."
2Yt6raj-S1M,This is how most jobs are. Its kind of like the real world. But the stuff they&#39;re teaching is pointless.
2Yt6raj-S1M,harjot sidhu well kids are just kids they’ll goof around all the time. Again they are not meant to be robots
2Yt6raj-S1M,@CheeseCheeks But see.. memory and intelligence are so different... a dog would remember someone&#39;s face for his whole life but it doesn&#39;t mean he&#39;s intelligent..
2Yt6raj-S1M,"@Dylanmcgo2266 no dude, think about Albert Einstein, his memory was so bad that once he forgot his own home address."
2Yt6raj-S1M,Everyone knows already
2Yt6raj-S1M,StriKreator the problem is you
2Yt6raj-S1M,StriKreator EXACTLY
2Yt6raj-S1M,LMAO
2Yt6raj-S1M,Dude to me it actually looks like she’s agreeing with him.
2Yt6raj-S1M,MikMik Mak lol me too
2Yt6raj-S1M,Rahim Majbof sammmeeee
2Yt6raj-S1M,that is exactly what I had in my mind when I was 15 ugghghuheih now I&#39;m 17
2Yt6raj-S1M,"Brian Mo EXACTLY... like ok there are some things about school that are valuable (very few) but yeah for the most part I completely agree with him and how the education system is just all about remembering things for a test so you can get a good grade on it. And following a path everyone else is taking. And if you’re taking that path that everyone else is taking bc it is your dream and passion, go for it. But if it’s not and you’re just taking it bc that’s what’s expected of you, LEAVE. I say that school should be all about teaching kids about creativity and finding their passion. There are so many things that the education system is lacking. And it’s sad to think about bc it’s the 21st century... you’d think there’d be some sort of change or improvement."
2Yt6raj-S1M,The point that school makes others kill themselves but than you realize when someone kills themselves u will get more homework.
2Yt6raj-S1M,@Yasser Gamer KSA What do you think is gonna happen if you leave school lol? That you are gonna create a busyness and be another Bill Gates? xD
2Yt6raj-S1M,Honestly
2Yt6raj-S1M,Is my mom the only one who agrees with this video?

2Yt6raj-S1M,And of course not people who are education sheeple.
2Yt6raj-S1M,Talk to people. Not school people.

2Yt6raj-S1M,@Fran and take over the world and make everything better.
2Yt6raj-S1M,@leo lion that could be a good plan hahaha
2Yt6raj-S1M,@Fran and start our revolution?
2Yt6raj-S1M,"@leo lion Truth does not need manipulation. If u think u cant change the hardest people,go on the easy ones. A crowd will be created. We know what happens when crowds are created,more and more people join."
2Yt6raj-S1M,We need to chip away on society. Even if it involves manipulating them. They need to learn humility.
2Yt6raj-S1M,"Same here. School only cares about your grades, not what you&#39;ve actually learned."
2Yt6raj-S1M,@AJPlayz707 the money? lmao do you know how much teachers get paid?
2Yt6raj-S1M,See even an A school student thinks its so useless!!
2Yt6raj-S1M,@Chad De Carvalho exactly. In history &amp; English I get praised for my writing (Idk why) and for some reason it pisses me off cause they think that I consciously put more effort.
2Yt6raj-S1M,"Fqke me too! I&#39;m always lead the class and sometimes the whole school but I learned from the Internet more, a lot"
2Yt6raj-S1M,"SpicyJuul just like they showed us a prince ea video saying don’t use phones, yet they don’t mention how he disproves of the school system"
2Yt6raj-S1M,lol 😂
2Yt6raj-S1M,* Illuminti theme plays *
2Yt6raj-S1M,"Same, our registration teacher shows us Ted Talk videos but never this one."
2Yt6raj-S1M,my school showed a ted talk to us about how stress is good... and im sitting here thinking how good is stress if exams arent even a good test for anything
2Yt6raj-S1M,"Just the week before last, I spent at least 10 hours on homework, in 8th grade. I get 6 hours of free time and even then, I actually only get 2."
2Yt6raj-S1M,i like p.e. when i am allowed to play games
2Yt6raj-S1M,ISWEARTHISISNOTWHATITLOOKSLIKE same :/
2Yt6raj-S1M,samte thangsuansang mine is 8 hrs lol
2Yt6raj-S1M,"@a.m My asthma disagrees lol. I actually hated PE mostly because my coach wouldn&#39;t listen to me when I told her I couldn&#39;t breathe, but I love going to the gym now. I go 5-6 times a week, but I guess I enjoy lifting weights versus attempting to run the mile with my coach telling me to hurry up even though I felt like a cinder block was on my chest the whole time. Still don&#39;t understand why the wheezing wasn&#39;t concerning her?"
2Yt6raj-S1M,"I bet that guy is his dad who just knew about all of this and is very disappointed in him. Not mad, just disappointed"
2Yt6raj-S1M,I was looking for this comment<br><br>That guy looks like he’s thinking “why do you do this to me man”
2Yt6raj-S1M,"What the, how?"
2Yt6raj-S1M,That is the stupidest way ever in history to fail an assignment. This proves some teachers feed on pain.
2Yt6raj-S1M,I&#39;ve done that while writing a story. I don&#39;t think I got a bad grade. It was a small assignment. XD This was like 7th grade.
2Yt6raj-S1M,"Ouch, and i hate essay and writing because it just a waste of time. And i can feel how painful you got a F at your assignment, ouch"
2Yt6raj-S1M,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Yt6raj-S1M&amp;t=2m00s"">2:00</a>"
2Yt6raj-S1M,At least that means having creativity haha but the high imposive part is wrong evidently
2Yt6raj-S1M,Aaron Zeph Cabebe ...
2Yt6raj-S1M,@Mr Leg Stop being a Survival Guy here become creative.... Dude U gotta move on
2Yt6raj-S1M,Reeble Snarfle I care
2Yt6raj-S1M,Who fricking cares?
2Yt6raj-S1M,"Somi 87 exactly. It’s outdated. Back in our parents’ days, the jobs would require you to do stuff exactly how you’re told to do it and this is what schools do. But nowadays you’re rewarded for creativity and cooperation, not orders"
2Yt6raj-S1M,so college should be started way early then I guess
2Yt6raj-S1M,"Preach it, girl! I completely agree with what you are saying."
2Yt6raj-S1M,Need*
2Yt6raj-S1M,I agree
2Yt6raj-S1M,👌👌👌👌👌👌👌
2Yt6raj-S1M,Please!!!<br>Show on internet!
2Yt6raj-S1M,A NAME BOIIIIII
2Yt6raj-S1M,THE PEOPLE DEMAND THE NAME
2Yt6raj-S1M,Does it teach arts or music? I demand the name of this school.
2Yt6raj-S1M,David Brett yea we need ur school name bro
2Yt6raj-S1M,"Yeah I have cousins in South Asia and I feel so bad for them, it’s because the exams are ridiculously hard, one of them went to 10 hour classes weekend classes every week as well as school and after school tutoring, and still failed her A levels :/"
2Yt6raj-S1M,thats nothing. IN MALAYSIA WE STILL HAVE CANES IN KINDERGARTEN AND  PRIMARY SCHOOL
2Yt6raj-S1M,Boy I had to write essays every week in elementary school
2Yt6raj-S1M,Hold my beer (I am from Nepal)
2Yt6raj-S1M,"Well tutoring isn’t required (for me), and I have a lot of free time now since I switched schools. In my old school we had our first class at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Yt6raj-S1M&amp;t=7m20s"">7:20</a> and I had to wake up at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Yt6raj-S1M&amp;t=6m00s"">6:00</a>. Other people had the bus come at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Yt6raj-S1M&amp;t=6m00s"">6:00</a>, and had to wake up earlier."
2Yt6raj-S1M,"@Friendly Neighborhood Asian Man thats cool knowledge dude, very interesting"
2Yt6raj-S1M,"In the uk at least, u learn through  copying  skills, and then u apply them"
2Yt6raj-S1M,ya
2Yt6raj-S1M,You’re taught how to pass a test. Not how the universe works.
2Yt6raj-S1M,Wtf
2Yt6raj-S1M,keanro999 will power wish u was my parent my parents brainwashed asf
2Yt6raj-S1M,I don&#39;t like the video because it is true. thumb down doesn&#39;t equal hate.
2Yt6raj-S1M,"It isn’t the teachers, just the education system."
2Yt6raj-S1M,"Not likely. Probably superintendents, and high ranks in the teaching industry. Many teachers actually hate the public school system."
2Yt6raj-S1M,"It could also be government officials, and principals."
2Yt6raj-S1M,I’m glad you’re happy
2Yt6raj-S1M,Lol I wish school makes me miserable and I cant even look forward to going home because I know I&#39;ll have to do so much homework 😔
2Yt6raj-S1M,"exactly! I just started eighth grade and it&#39;s boring as heck. I just wanna go home, and draw another version of magneto, build my Minecraft city, or drop some sick beats (they&#39;re not very sick, unless you count how you feel after hearing them)."
2Yt6raj-S1M,Lmao true I end up thinking about suicidal thoughts in the middle of classes
2Yt6raj-S1M,I have PTSD from middle school.
2Yt6raj-S1M,"And how much money do you think you&#39;ll make with that? Just wondering. A lot of kids consider doing things like that, but I don&#39;t think you&#39;ll be as marketable as others."
2Yt6raj-S1M,They value test scores so they can get awards for doing nothing
2Yt6raj-S1M,@SkyloverMC His teacher didn&#39;t do that for him.
2Yt6raj-S1M,My teacher skipped that lesson to teach us trig
2Yt6raj-S1M,Imperial Blast what?
2Yt6raj-S1M,DIFFERENT
2Yt6raj-S1M,SAME
2Yt6raj-S1M,"VV Vane  vlame the illuminati, that&#39;s who&#39;s behind evrythibg anyway, blame them, and you&#39;ll mosr likely be right!"
2Yt6raj-S1M,Run for it
2Yt6raj-S1M,Don&#39;t blame! RUN!
2Yt6raj-S1M,GingerMrWHO It was very good. Thanks.
2Yt6raj-S1M,"I think instead of laughing the man was concentrating on what he was meaning, or maybe he is processing what he was taking about."
2Yt6raj-S1M,"@JoubaMetyNow I understand your statement and I agree with you and @nationalistfromcanada that the schoolsystem has to change but his wording isn&#39;t the right way, thanks."
2Yt6raj-S1M,"@JoubaMety Haha, I mean tought 😅"
2Yt6raj-S1M,"@Eline Smit It&#39;s because it isn&#39;t entirely lack of creative intelligence... That&#39;s problem with that. Because they could be doing something in their personal time. School-related or no. @Nationalist from Canada put it nicely, that there wasn&#39;t problem with it, just wording. I&#39;m still not sure about his company being more successful than companies founded by Harvard or Stanford graduates.<br>Wait... <i>Is it even possible to teach something realistic without practice?</i> If you want to be taught realistic, <b>go outside.</b>"
2Yt6raj-S1M,"@JoubaMety I think it&#39;s still not the right conclusion, because the older children didn&#39;t like his idea, they are less creative intelligent? I think they taught more realistic then the younger kids but that&#39;s my opinion, I think there most be first come more research about this topic..."
2Yt6raj-S1M,@Eline Smit He didn&#39;t even say just less intelligent. These &#39;older&#39; children are LESS CREATIVE INTELLIGENT and MORE ACADEMIC INTELLIGENT. You just didn&#39;t pay attention.
2Yt6raj-S1M,"Since you’re learning English, I’ll correct you a bit.<br><br>You should have wrote I LEARNT to speak English instead of I learn."
2Yt6raj-S1M,@Xesar Briliants I agree with you. You learn english every year.
2Yt6raj-S1M,Good job. You get a useless sticker.
2Yt6raj-S1M,Good 4U!
2Yt6raj-S1M,"I mean like yeah<br>For 9 years of me learning about English, in my country, it shows you the same thing all over again. And what&#39;s more ridiculous is that the English education here is too bound on formality, not necessity, and that&#39;s making them tired and ignore it... <br><br>So basically my friends can only answer yes or no, regardless of the questions..."
2Yt6raj-S1M,Heated lmao
2Yt6raj-S1M,"He isn&#39;t pissed, he could be thinking about the things he&#39;s saying"
2Yt6raj-S1M,maybe he didnt get the joke jhahah
2Yt6raj-S1M,Yes hahahaha
2Yt6raj-S1M,Yusur Kassem yeah but you start off with a      F U
2Yt6raj-S1M,Unfortunately - I don&#39;t want to experiment anymore because of what school has done to me.
2Yt6raj-S1M,A kid in my class can only leave 1 time to go to the bathroom or leave for the whole day
2Yt6raj-S1M,"Why does school, and why do teachers love using 5 year old words to describe things!?"
2Yt6raj-S1M,"I&#39;m going into 11th grade and believe it or not, we have the so-called &quot;Potty Passes&quot; too, we can only go twice a semester, or once every quarter. Nobody says anything about it. School thinks it&#39;s normal."
2Yt6raj-S1M,They need to know where you are in case of a fire drill or lockdown or some kind of emergency
2Yt6raj-S1M,probably its what we like doing that can earn us money
2Yt6raj-S1M,I&#39;m 17years and 9daysold and saaaaammmmmmmmmeeeeeee

2Yt6raj-S1M,Golden comment right here
2Yt6raj-S1M,@Mecha9 yeah =)
2Yt6raj-S1M,Andrey exactly.
2Yt6raj-S1M,Also what I really loved about LEGO Movie was that in the end everyone turned out to be a master builder inside: they just needed their push that would motivate them to unleash their creativity.
2Yt6raj-S1M,"And how to be so stressed that I get angry over small, tiny things that aren&#39;t important (yes I developed anger issues)"
2Yt6raj-S1M,&quot;So far&quot; not so far..
2Yt6raj-S1M,can relate
2Yt6raj-S1M,Nina Denise actually school teaches us the ILLUSION that we work best under procrastination. Good luck delaying your college studying. It won’t work as well.
2Yt6raj-S1M,That&#39;s how they train us for factory work
2Yt6raj-S1M,Lol I can’t remember what I learn but I remember what I imagine about yesterday
2Yt6raj-S1M,Do not mention it. I hope all your dreams will come true!
2Yt6raj-S1M,Snow Lover Thank you- it means a lot to me.
2Yt6raj-S1M,"You will be amazing. You’ll find your inspiration, and you will be remarkable. Just know I believe in you! Be you, and do what you love, and do not let anyone try to change that."
2Yt6raj-S1M,My imagination is higher than education
2Yt6raj-S1M,Kylie Smith ok atleast u have good reasons unlike others
2Yt6raj-S1M,"@Lord Angel I&#39;m not overreacting. I have depression. Severe depression and anxiety. I hate myself and if I do something wrong in school or if I forget to do my homework, I basically bully myself. It may seem like i&#39;m overreacting, but there are people stuck in the same situation I&#39;m in where school makes you wanna kill yourself."
2Yt6raj-S1M,Kylie Smith How tf does school make you suicidal thats just overreacting
2Yt6raj-S1M,"Actually, school doesn&#39;t shut my mind out. It opens the doors for negativity and depression and anxiety and suicidal thoughts, etc, etc."
2Yt6raj-S1M,It is dropping out of school isn’t worth it trust me.
2Yt6raj-S1M,N&#39;zoth The Corruptor Yes it is.
2Yt6raj-S1M,Homework is useless.
2Yt6raj-S1M,Like a robot....
2Yt6raj-S1M,oh same :( I&#39;m currently thinking of what I seriously want to do and focus on that)

2Yt6raj-S1M,The Confusing Riddle even if you tried doing something about it. It doesn’t change the fact or help. You learn maths and forget it the next day (Advanced maths) not basic.
2Yt6raj-S1M,yeah i drop off wakamatsu kawaa
2Yt6raj-S1M,"Does such thing even exist? Besides, wakamatsu-kawada is a subway station."

2Yt6raj-S1M,All those years of doing maths and the critical part of my brain is still closed...
2Yt6raj-S1M,Keep close to your heart what you know as REAL knowledge!
2Yt6raj-S1M,I can&#39;t have that knowledge shoved in my brain if I wake up at 6 AM when it&#39;s still literally dark out :I

2Yt6raj-S1M,"@nobody cares We don&#39;t have to learn every single math philosophy right away in school you know, if it comes to a point where people need to learn those things, then they should be taught it when they absolutely need to, instead of it being cramped into our brains when half pf us aren&#39;t ever gonna use it, that&#39;s how students fall behind. 💜"
2Yt6raj-S1M,"@PrincessPonyLover honey what is learn in school is Hella basic, the   math oriented careers start in calculo ( I don&#39;t know it is wrote in English sorry) that is way more advance, but it&#39;s true that we should have to play a more big role in deciding what we want to learn, like in my country we choose between a more lenguage based corriculum or a more scientific one, but that decidcion should be mode a bit more early."
2Yt6raj-S1M,"@nobody cares Of course that&#39;s true, but we don&#39;t have to learn EVERY SINGLE THING if most of us are never gonna use it in our lives. Learning those things should be optional, or things like that should be taught if you&#39;re actually gonna do things in the future that require learning those things. 💜"
2Yt6raj-S1M,"@PrincessPonyLover they might be not to used for you on your everyday task but the one who wanted to be a engineer will have to used them every day.<br>Math is actually quite important to build and create stuff, so for buying bread it  may not be useful but knowledge, in every shape or form, has value in itself, if it didn&#39;t we wouldn&#39;t have philosophy.<br>I do think that&#39;s I big problem in education that it&#39;s the students fault, because we don&#39;t value what we were tough because it is no useful.<br>People may find history not useful or philosophy or any science but they do help you have more broad spectrum of the world and take better choices."
2Yt6raj-S1M,I think it looks more like he&#39;s concentrating on what Eddy is saying

2Yt6raj-S1M,"I&#39;m so bad at math. It has made me want to bash my head off of a wall so many damn times.  😭😭😭<br>And I hate the fact that people stereotype Asians as &quot;smart&quot;. Sure, there are many smart people out there in Asia, but that doesn&#39;t make all Asians smart."

2Yt6raj-S1M,Justice Kellett Mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell
2Yt6raj-S1M,At my school no one is bullied. Not that I know of at least. This may be because I&#39;m in PreAP though. I was  bullied in elementary though.
2Yt6raj-S1M,@Dylan go you!! Be happi
2Yt6raj-S1M,Ezdy Basically my life tbh lol luckily this is my last year I’m in the 12th grade and I graduate in May thank god :) 😂
2Yt6raj-S1M,relatable
2Yt6raj-S1M,I love middle school a lot more than elementary. Middle school is fun right now. I hope it&#39;ll be nice at my new school too tho. I&#39;m moving. 😭😭😭😭😭
2Yt6raj-S1M,It was...
2Yt6raj-S1M,my 5th grade teacher was the best. It really depends on the teacher. Some of my favorite teachers are the ones where I learned the most. They made learning fun.
2Yt6raj-S1M,"it really is. it brings the creativity in you, plus less hw lol"
2Yt6raj-S1M,You know why? Let me tell you. Elementary schooling is about actually teaching. Almost everything you are taught in elementary you use everyday and have memorized. Moving to middle school you still learn valuable knowledge you need for every day life and after that. Highschool is just about making hard workers. We are taught that the Pythagorean theorem is more important that learning how to do taxes. We are taught that learning that the mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell is more important than exploring post secondary school options other than what they throw at us 24/7 with “go to college”. Highschool is only there to teach you to go to college. You won’t use almost anything you learn in those 4 years after it’s over and it’s the biggest waste of time in history.
2Yt6raj-S1M,"Right!! And when you hand in something late, no matter how excellent or good it is, your mark drops down"
2Yt6raj-S1M,Once we had to do a PowerPoint but I decided to late a 3d simulation project. I got a D though it was the favourite project in the class
2Yt6raj-S1M,It really sucks
2Yt6raj-S1M,"Same. Got in trouble in 12 grade for not doing my essay first, outline second. SO BORING and PLANNED OUT. Let me be creative"
2Yt6raj-S1M,My teachers be like<br>Teacher: Let&#39;s write something that makes us happy<br>Everyone: YESSSSS<br>Teacher: But things you like about the school<br>Everyone: Well what do we do now
2Yt6raj-S1M,what are you trying to say?
2Yt6raj-S1M,camilizer that’s how I feel in high school right now
2Yt6raj-S1M,"Sadly,. nothing will change because it&#39;s not about education, it&#39;s indoctrination and profit. Go online and find out about the origins and original purpose for Public Schools, it&#39;s disturbing."
2Yt6raj-S1M,"On my state test, i plan to completely ignore the essay prompt and write an essay about why the school system sucks."
2Yt6raj-S1M,&quot;No one has ever changed the world by doing what the world told them to do.&quot; <br>I&#39;m sure he meant the one who wait until the education system to be changed will archive nothing. What he was trying to tell in his speech is the education system sucks and makes you less intelligent but keep in your mind you can open the new door and change the world. YOU must act now instead of waiting for someone to act
2Yt6raj-S1M,Thinking the same thing here
2Yt6raj-S1M,Jolo7t it’s gotten worse
2Yt6raj-S1M,"You mean “teach,” right?"
2Yt6raj-S1M,1. Pay bill<br>2. Ur done
2Yt6raj-S1M,How to pay bills<br>You have $1000<br>Taxes take 40% away<br>Now you have $600 dollars<br>There you go

2Yt6raj-S1M,"And, there are many people who dropped out of high school or college, but ended up being super smart and famous for their great achievements! Such people include Mark Zuckerberg, Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, and Thomas Edison!"
2Yt6raj-S1M,Barry P. That’s all well and dandy but if a student has absolutely no interest in a subject they are forced to take we can’t expect them to take anything away from it
2Yt6raj-S1M,Also a lot of kids just copy the answers from online and just regurgitate the textbook again and again
2Yt6raj-S1M,Mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell!

2Yt6raj-S1M,민수 yeah because you are most likely spending time reading when you could study
2Yt6raj-S1M,"I agree with this, but one of my teachers, unfortunately just one of them, manages to find ways to challenge us and to develop our imagination. She doesn&#39;t really care about the school program and the fact we have a really important exam. And perhaps this is why  I love her lessons so much. We just need more teachers like her."

You may just say, &quot;I will be like Eddy...and start my own business!&quot; Go for it, if you are as naturally talented as he is. Are you interested in entrepreneurship? Do you have the chops to form, start, and run your own business? His story works because it is told as a personal history lesson. Not everyone listening to it can do what he did. Take his speech as an indictment of the great American school system, if anything. Still, however, get through it, then carve your path once you are gone. If you are as confident then as you seem to be now, it should be a breeze, right? (By the way, it is &quot;principal.&quot;)"

2Yt6raj-S1M,I used this joke elsewhere lol.
2Yt6raj-S1M,"@Legen D yes of course, not every student wants to be a doctor and i didnt say that they did. i agree with you that maths are one of those subjects that dont matter to everyone and thats why i think maths should be taught until a certain age so that every student knows their basic maths, but the complex maths.. they shouldnt be taught to everyone. though to be a police officer you need some schooling as well, but not the same as the doctors. though in my opinion everyone should be taught english and a foreign lanuage, like spanish or german, which could be useful as a police officer as well. in my country kids from about 14 and up can choose their own subjects, i dont know if thats the same where you live."

Usually when it comes to creative people thinking of making something from the ground up, In my mind I guess I&#39;m a but of a thief because I&#39;m great at improving something function but not creating so I guess my point was there was different types of creativity as well and that I itself is creative design."
2Yt6raj-S1M,"@Bryan Reed yeah. Like maybe make an air conditioner with a timer and a date. I guess that&#39;s what you mean? Personally, I still consider an improvement for something existing as creative."

2Yt6raj-S1M,@kxmode I really wanna know how did you learn programming code on your own?
2Yt6raj-S1M,"Yes. For the basics. Yes. Yes. But higher education can stifle, not to mention put people in tremendous debt. Today people can get a world-class education online for free. Meanwhile they can find their own path to enlightenment without being forced into a mold."
2Yt6raj-S1M,"Many of the brightest and smartest people who ever lived never graduated from school or college or a university. I&#39;m not saying that school doesn&#39;t have a place in society because it does, instead, for some, school stifles a path of knowledge that shines brightly. The only way to learn it is to leave the familiar."

2Yt6raj-S1M,"I know it! Isn&#39;t civics mandatory in your state? Oh wait, only few states require taking civics (basically US government, US history, and foundations of government) in public schools. Sucks, huh? I&#39;m 14. I&#39;m fortunate to go to a school where my teachers value teaching things that will benefit us in our lives rather than simply teaching us the absolute minimum just to pass a test. Unfortunately, our state, just like any other, DOES have certain requirements and things that MUST be covered in the curriculum. Those mandates force teachers to cover topics that might not necessarily benefit us or be used in the future, which can take up most of their time. And sometimes, teachers don&#39;t give two shits and only do what is asked of them. Some teachers do more than just teach. They inspire. Empower. But that&#39;s just the selected few. The problem isn&#39;t school itself, but what programs are available, the quality of educators, and what tax payer money is used for."
2Yt6raj-S1M,Speak for yourself.

2Yt6raj-S1M,"gamer 2.0 Research the Habits of Mind affiliated with Growth Mindset education and <b>you shall be liberated.</b><br><br>Ok, a bit dramatic there, but there has recently been a shift in SOME thinking and programming within education (I can’t speak for all of it, obviously, because I haven’t taught *everywhere*).<br><br>I student-taught within a project-based, public middle school program, some aspects of which compared favorably to my own college undergrad experience. There was a ton of student choice and investment within that program, relative to the rest of the school (it actually had the lowest absence rates in the entire school district). That’s where education is theoretically headed, fortunately."
2Yt6raj-S1M,"lorá alba Worry not, it&#39;s okay. I agree with you, I think not everybody was born to be an entrepreneur. However, let&#39;s suppose we can change the way our children grow, let&#39;s suppose we can make an actual entrepreneurial society. How would we manage that? Many will surely say the answer may come in due time. But, can we foresee how to handle that?<br>Or perhaps, can we star molding it from now? Because we can do something beforehand if it&#39;s the case."

2Yt6raj-S1M,For real tho my friend went to the teacher and said “ why do we have freedom of speech if we can’t talk in class?” Some thing like that and the teacher said “ because it’s class” and my friend replied “ so being in class automatically takes away our rights?!?!”

2Yt6raj-S1M,"Nah, a lot of teachers know it&#39;s broken they just aren&#39;t in the position to try and fix it. It could put their jobs in jeopardy, and teaching isn&#39;t a stable career anymore. The dislikers are the people who support the board of education, work in it, or are old enough that they were in school before the system started really falling apart at the seams."
2Yt6raj-S1M,"No, many teachers understand this as fact, it&#39;s just that they&#39;re more tightly enslaved to it that they barely speak out. In fact in my experience they only talk about it when a student brings it up, which enables them to blast the broken system."

2Yt6raj-S1M,"They didn&#39;t; you only hear the exceptions that did. Also, they didn&#39;t &#39;&#39;drop out&#39;&#39; - they chose to quit because they already had a profitable business plan, which was more reasonable than college at that moment. <br><br>The richer your business, the bigger the luck factor becomes. Becoming a billionaire is basically the same as saying you want to become Messi. Only very few people can actually become famous soccer players (millionaires), while most people can become coaches without too much luck involved (like a college degree). Why would you want to risk your life for success, if you can have a guaranteed decent income. That&#39;s why they teach you to be non-creative, because it&#39;s what the average person can do. Imagine if only like 5% were super wealthy and the rest were dirt poor because they weren&#39;t lucky enough.<br><br>Also, true creativity is very rare. It&#39;s truly another form of intelligence. Most people that say they are &#39;&#39;creative&#39;&#39; aren&#39;t actually creative. You need to hit the genetic and environmental lottery to even stand a chance of competing in the entrepeneurworld. And to win in the world, you need even more luck, making it way too improbable to be a feasable way to teach children."
2Yt6raj-S1M,And a lot of the worst criminals
2Yt6raj-S1M,They had their lives figured out. They had a plan. We don&#39;t. Those guys deeply value education. They just didn&#39;t finish it because it would&#39;ve harmed their businesses.
2Yt6raj-S1M,No it&#39;s not.
2Yt6raj-S1M,Please tell me how analyzing literature does that. Cuz I don&#39;t get it at all despite learning for 4 years. I can&#39;t analyze stuff at all.
2Yt6raj-S1M,"I see where you&#39;re coming from, but I feel like there are other ways to teach people how to critically think through things that may prove to be useful to majority of students. Things such as money management. Money management can cause a student to critically think, and it will also make them less likely in the future to hit a financial rut, which will give them a higher chance of becoming successful. Likewise, teaching us geometry and fancy algebraic equations may also help us critically think, but I can only think of very few instances where memorizing all those equations would prove to be beneficial and worth my time."
2Yt6raj-S1M,"neat but you don&#39;t need to do that for 12 years straight. there is no balance in this system and because you learned basic literature and math and cut out actual critical thinking classes students will never properly develop significant critical thinking skills. it can&#39;t just be some random side effect from other subjects, thats not how the brain works."

2Yt6raj-S1M,Awful idea
2Yt6raj-S1M,"It shows the teacher that you can work independently of others and what amount of knowledge you&#39;ve processed.  It also allows you to self-regulate the quality of homework.

2Yt6raj-S1M,Michael Harto so calculating the speed of a fly is basic skills?<br>(Sorry for bad English)
2Yt6raj-S1M,DoubleSided Gaming I feel like schools should be designed to teach students the necessary info about whatever they wanna be when they grow up. But first they should teach them the basic info to understand the rest and then so on. I know not everybody needs to know about the Pythagorean theorem.
2Yt6raj-S1M,the school is old and broken
2Yt6raj-S1M,Miscraft You took the words right out of my head...
2Yt6raj-S1M,"maths is fun I still notice a problem though. I understand putting students through stress to prepare them but if you were to excel in a certain profession, you wouldn&#39;t be as stressed to overcome difficult tasks.<br>For example, I would like to edit films for large grossing companies. I would have more stress over a test (mostly standardized testing) that only shows up as a letter grade in the end. The issue being I would have to do good in something completely unrelatable (depending on the subject) just to be able to start learning about the profession I want.<br> People say to me with my edits &quot;Oh wow! That looks amazing! You&#39;ll work for someone big one day with that!&quot; There lies the issue of I wouldn&#39;t be able to if my knowledge on a subject I won&#39;t need to know anything about is one I struggle in and prevents me from attending a school that would push me along in life."
2Yt6raj-S1M,"That&#39;s not the entire world. I think only the United States has that kind of a system. In my country, we learn financial literacy in schools as well"
2Yt6raj-S1M,"What about our parents? They can teach us that. Ask your parents how to do these things, I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll set some time aside for you."
2Yt6raj-S1M,"You go to school because of that grammar, needs helping 👀"
2Yt6raj-S1M,"Ethan Fisher-Perez Maybe it&#39;s the fact that the information that gets told to you is almost certainly useless. We don&#39;t need algebra or how to solve quadratics. The reason they teach you this in maths particular, is to help solve puzzles and increase your awareness and common sense. If the teachers actually told them how to pay out a mortgage or something, pretty sure they&#39;d be willing to listen. No one cares about maths, really."
2Yt6raj-S1M,"Wait a minute. If everything they teach you goes in one ear and out the other, wouldn&#39;t it be the same as if they taught you &quot;life skills&quot;? The amount you take in at school is not the fault of the school or the material. It&#39;s the fault of you."
2Yt6raj-S1M,HAHAHAHAHA the sad reality is that schools need to be banned and that something needs to replace it...<br><br><br><b>I learn nothing from school</b>
2Yt6raj-S1M,"You are soul I&#39;m really curious how your fuse hasn&#39;t blown up yet from all the grammar mistakes (myself included, probably).<br><br>All jokes aside, I think that this is the merit of school. As I stated on another thread somewhere in this comment section, there is a certain base that students require if they wish to pursue a certain dream and passion. But, a bit of a problem for schools comes in the form of Google, and the fact that everyone (mostly) is in possession of an infinitely large library. Perhaps focusing on individual developing of each student, rather than laying out a mold for them would be the better solution for this, as it would keep schools relevant, while developing each and every individual as a functioning member of society AND guiding them towards their own personal set of goals and passions, instead of prepping them for a life spent in a comfort zone, as a cog in someone else&#39;s plans. A combination of Japan and Finland&#39;s education systems would be perfect. 4 years of teaching basic values in society, and basic skills and 8 years of studying a personalized and unique timetable which includes the general and basic subjects, and a plethora of other subjects relevant to the student&#39;s own views, dreams, goals."
2Yt6raj-S1M,"Sarthak Gaur no but you have to be real here. If everyone could create incredible things and earn millions of dollars then who would do the simple yet very necessary jobs? It&#39;s a lie that everyone is creative it&#39;s utter nonsense and honestly damaging to society. We should encourage those who are extremely creative and possess traits that predict success such as; extroversion, moderate disagreeableness, motivation etc to be the best they can possibly be. But I know a whole host of people who aren&#39;t any of these things and aren&#39;t capable of achieving entrepreneurial success."
2Yt6raj-S1M,Yeah Who knows if one day you might decide you enjoy something that is based on either of those subjects. I see school as a really long introductory period that focuses on introducing you to things with the goal that you may like said things so that at least you&#39;ll have OPTIONS later on in life. It is quite valuable in truth.
2Yt6raj-S1M,"I love this; you ,sir or ma&#39;am, are so right."

2Yt6raj-S1M,"@Lo Any time my friend. There are other ways you can grab attention to this issue. For example you can make a group with a few friends in which you can discuss the problems in our school system where other students and school staff are also welcome. This can be advertised with flyers outside of school grounds (if it doesn&#39;t allow that sort of thing) or spread the message via word of mouth. Idk just an idea. I&#39;m not saying you shouldn&#39;t draw attention to this, but there are much much better ways to go about this. You&#39;re also free to leave my advice if you don&#39;t like it. But in any case, safe travels in life my friend, and God bless :)"
2Yt6raj-S1M,"Well , that screws over my idea of trying to get the teachers&#39; attention. Anyway thanks for not letting me go with my horrendously thought out plan."
2Yt6raj-S1M,"@Lo Even if you did learn how to hack, it wouldn&#39;t solve anything. Most teachers and principals are aware that the school system is broken. But it&#39;s broken even beyond the actual teaching. In the best case scenario you&#39;d be suspended or expelled. Worst case be filed with criminal charges. And the idea that &quot;starting a rebellion&quot; will &quot;make them see&quot; is quite puerile and most likely preaching to the choir as you&#39;d want to make a statement about the obvious. Adults aren&#39;t as blind as you think XD <br>And I can argue for the things that the system does get right, but like any system made by humans ever it&#39;s not perfect and it still needs significant improvements. I&#39;m just trying to not let you get hurt pointlessly :)"
2Yt6raj-S1M,"You know, I tried to hack the school&#39;s wi-fi system to show this video to the school.

2Yt6raj-S1M,Ours is the opposite<br><br>“Knowledge is useless. LET’S MAKE OUR PUPILS MAKE AN ACTUAL WORKING HOUSE WITH LIGHTS OUT OF POPSICLE STICKS”<br>I’m not saying it’s bad. It’s fun actually but at the same time stressful. The teachers make you do whatever you want with your project (as long as it’s appropriate)
2Yt6raj-S1M,Studying 4 nothing
2Yt6raj-S1M,12 years... We can only be a kid for a short time.
2Yt6raj-S1M,when you say it like that it sounds useful
2Yt6raj-S1M,"as an entrepenur you utilize the socrates method of making a hypothesis about something, checking it, and verifying whether it met the hypothesis or not.<br><br>before you make a business, make a product, a hypothesis."
2Yt6raj-S1M,Well I don&#39;t like school and I admit I don&#39;t give it my due to it not serving my type of style but I woundnt resort to slacking around
2Yt6raj-S1M,"You are a teacher, i can tell"
2Yt6raj-S1M,"The majority of kids don&#39;t event follow the same direction at graduation. It is basically what their parents and school are telling them what they need to do to be successful, but guess how many end up being successful? Only about 30 - 20 percent."
2Yt6raj-S1M,"Einstein was home schooled- funny, I just found that out today 😀"
2Yt6raj-S1M,"And btw his last quote might be true, but it doesnt apply to his speech at all. Its not like einstein didnt receive education right? You have to learn the basics before you can build something new. If Einstein first had to find out how math worked by himself he would&#39;ve had no time to discover other things. <br><br>I get what this guy is trying to say but IMO school isnt bad, its just how you choose to apply your received knowledge into something new. <br><br>All these people complaining about school isnt interesting and that they forget everything anyway are just not sure what they like. In my highschool years i didnt enjoy languages or history or geography, but i had to learn them anyway. Bad education you say? Well how would i know wether i liked them or not if no one ever showed me what it was like. Its only wasted time if you make it so."
2Yt6raj-S1M,You don&#39;t exactly need College for a job. There&#39;s always a way around the system.
2Yt6raj-S1M,So you think that school is helping the youth? My answer is that it depends on the mindset of the kids. But school seems to force ONLY one way of being successful.
2Yt6raj-S1M,If you try harder you will become smarter though. It&#39;s the same thing
2Yt6raj-S1M,the education system rewards effort. time and hard work that you dedicate to your schoolwork will show
2Yt6raj-S1M,K B but that&#39;s the thing. I don&#39;t want to try but I have to or else I cant graduate in 2 years
2Yt6raj-S1M,K B disagree. The real world won’t work that way. But simultaneously failure shouldn’t be punished but used as a teaching tool. Education shouldn’t be based around mindless memorization and conformity.
2Yt6raj-S1M,K B Tell that to the students&#39; future bosses.
2Yt6raj-S1M,Relatable
2Yt6raj-S1M,Claytopia W me too my math class we. Just sat there doing bother now I’m in college math is not my favorite

2Yt6raj-S1M,Claytopia W I&#39;m expecting myself to get an A on transfer but I&#39;m getting 68 out of 75!<br>I can&#39;t do long division
2Yt6raj-S1M,"In my school we are taught a subject and graded based on how we compare to other students, if you get a A you are above average there’s the intelligence"
2Yt6raj-S1M,"Eh, I get A’s and i understand what you’re saying, but it does take a lot of skill"
2Yt6raj-S1M,@Ethan Fisher-Perez sorry man a lot of high school kids either go to college and work minimum wage jobs or they skip college and just go straight to working...
2Yt6raj-S1M,lol im a person who fails
2Yt6raj-S1M,The thing about school is kids learn in different ways some learn while listening some learn in writing and school take almost all of the time in out life they say enjoy life cause its short. Yeah making life worthless with school but amma keep on studying not for intelligence not for grades but for the whole world
2Yt6raj-S1M,Wtf does this even mean?
2Yt6raj-S1M,"Like in college? Except much much more than 10,000$"
2Yt6raj-S1M,@Kebabsoße is this a joke?

2Yt6raj-S1M,Yeah 5-10 years ok
2Yt6raj-S1M,Actually there would be another way to earn money but being an entrepreneur will benefit you greater.
2Yt6raj-S1M,"&quot;Today&#39;s school system won&#39;t prepare them for that.&quot;  Quantum Consciousness -- sorry to break the news to you, but no school system will ever prepare students for that.  Being an entrepreneurs requires a combination of personality traits most people do not have and there is no type of education that will change that."
2Yt6raj-S1M,Do what you&#39;re good at and that creates value.
2Yt6raj-S1M,"It just goes to show how much we are slaves in the eyes of the government, if we keep a stable job and pay our taxes, we are keeping the economy running, and that&#39;s all that is important to them, we lose our individuality, and for some reason, that&#39;s what&#39;s normal, because &quot;dreams never come true&quot; and blah blah blah, sad really."

2Yt6raj-S1M,"Yeah, that&#39;s what I hate. I&#39;m completely useless, when it comes to science. It&#39;s okay with physics, because I&#39;m kinda interested in something from it (mainly just universe), but chemistry? I&#39;m happy that I&#39;m not failing. But whenever I complain, they just say &quot;You might need it in your life.&quot; Like I don&#39;t remember 99% of whatever we learned in chemistry, if I&#39;ll ever need it, I won&#39;t remember it anyway and use google."

2Yt6raj-S1M,"+False Name What I told my father is that before science &quot;came&quot; in an invention, first there was the imagination part, the creative part. School takes away this quality that every kid has. But when I Tell him this, he just says:&quot;but what can You do?&quot;"
2Yt6raj-S1M,"I have to kinda agree with him, school in it&#39;s core meaning, education and knowledge is very important and we really wouldn&#39;t be anywhere near to where we are today. What&#39;s wrong is though what you mentioned - the system, which suppresses and kills every creativity and imagination in kids. And that&#39;s terribly wrong, because creativity has just as big credit for our today&#39;s developed society as knowledge."

2Yt6raj-S1M,kittycat2317 yeah i was just about to suggest this.
2Yt6raj-S1M,I agree
2Yt6raj-S1M,Pretty sure at least 60 percent of kids agree with you.
2Yt6raj-S1M,Teachers aren&#39;t to blame for the way school works. Some teachers realise the flaws and just want to teach and help kids. Blame the people who actually decide what is taught and how the schools run.
2Yt6raj-S1M,Rosie Rose if u have kids dude dont compare them to other kids and let him learn mistake also btw dont forget the homeschool and let their creativity grow<br>Btw let them have friends

I honestly wish my parents would have just let me be homeschooled."
2Yt6raj-S1M,pfff i go to school and i am socialy awkward it doesent depend on that
2Yt6raj-S1M,"VejyMonsta Or to be simpler, school should teach how to deal life problems, not quadratic equations that are equally complicated (but never used in life). If school really meant to teach you how to solve problems, how come there&#39;s no &#39;how to never give up on your dreams&#39; subject, or &#39;How to pay your bills&#39; subject? It could really be a BIG help."
2Yt6raj-S1M,VejyMonsta i would like this comment but its to damn long
2Yt6raj-S1M,That&#39;s similar to my comment.

2Yt6raj-S1M,AJ RH2&#39;s You know nothing. Teachers can&#39;t change the education system. It&#39;s out of their control.
2Yt6raj-S1M,"Tolan Diana Izabela I agree. Success does not mean making enough money while you are miserable. Success means that while you are making enough money, you are doing what you love. I was reading the comments and I saw that another teacher commented saying that if everyone followed their dreams, nothing would get done in society. That is far from the truth. If everyone did what they loved, a ton would be done in society."
2Yt6raj-S1M,"I am a teacher and I totally agree with what he says. School is made to show you a lot of posibilities. The one that you like and learn will become your future career. Let&#39;s encourage a school with a lot of choices, where students choose what to study. Bring them teachers from the other side of the world, invest more money in education, invest in choice."

2Yt6raj-S1M,Wrong address. Send this to their higher ups. Teachers in developing countries are pressurized by people like us. But they are also forced to fulfill government statistics requirements.

They do what kids are supposed to do because they&#39;re kids! We&#39;re 5-11 year olds, why do you try to make us follow all these rules and expectations when we should be learning how to communicate with our peers and share our ideas. I know elementary isn&#39;t nearly as stressful as the other grades, but we shouldn&#39;t be hunkering down on our students just because law requires it."

2Yt6raj-S1M,I have never heard someone say artists are broke lol
2Yt6raj-S1M,I agree but teachers do a lot for us I wouldn’t take it out on them it’s the school system they go to classes for us and are taught what to teach and how to teach it ... in many cases teachers help many students. The school system needs to change in many ways but human beings need basic skills such as math and reading

2Yt6raj-S1M,If you invested more you would know there are multiple types of intelligences.  You would also know that some people that are brilliant in other ways have horrible grammar.  Go spend another 60 plus grand on being taught what to think instead of how to think.  If they taught you how to think instead of what to think then you wouldn&#39;t be indoctrinated into thinking there is only one type of intelligence and proper grammar is a sign of it.

2Yt6raj-S1M,Vince Phan I learned that when you&#39;re in school to me the rules be like: NO HATS NO FUN. MORE GETTING YELLED AT.
2Yt6raj-S1M,"Whatever. Not everyone wants to become an inebriated millionaire. I just want to be an educated middle class worker (instead of a dropout deadbeat) who lives a decent life based on emotion, not on greed of money."

2Yt6raj-S1M,@Discovaria yeah I&#39;m home schooled I love it
2Yt6raj-S1M,First Name Last Name they would never understand because as kids they were brainwashed to always follow instructions. A single human being (or group idk) came up with our education system and they think that’s just how life goes.
2Yt6raj-S1M,First Name Last Name i sent this to my dad
2Yt6raj-S1M,if u dont like your job just get another job? What im saying is some parents dont know how to teach or they have jobs
2Yt6raj-S1M,My parents have woken up but they both work unusual hours so they can&#39;t homeschool me
2Yt6raj-S1M,Here in my country my parents arent allowed to homeschool me. Nice right (educational system in europe sounds better but ^)
2Yt6raj-S1M,"Mrvoid Pasta Unfortunately, I have to go to school till I&#39;m 18 years old, and my parents expect me to go to college/university. I can&#39;t even imagine what their reaction would be if I wouldn&#39;t go."
2Yt6raj-S1M,No it&#39;s not. I am a 23 year old male who has learning disabilities and i didn&#39;t get the traditional education that my peers got.  I. Graduated high school and. My college professor&#39;s all tell me i should go into the medical field i love learning about. The human brain and Learning Disabilities. This interest. Came about 1  year after high school. And it&#39;s amazing how many people want me to succeed.   I didn&#39;t learn any of this in school
2Yt6raj-S1M,"Only after you waste 17 years learning things you don&#39;t care for in K-12, then finally being able to do what you want in college."
2Yt6raj-S1M,That’s actually not true at all.
2Yt6raj-S1M,"Nope, the problem isn&#39;t education. The problem is the way people are educated. You are far better off staying in school than brashly dropping out. How many people do you personally know who dropped out and turned out well?"
2Yt6raj-S1M,MLDank Memes more like a nobel
2Yt6raj-S1M,lol true
2Yt6raj-S1M,Math is fun for me!

2Yt6raj-S1M,+Wong Tik Ki there is no school that can teach you how to drive or wash. There is only few school that teaches you how to cook and make technology.
2Yt6raj-S1M,Wong Tik Ki my parents :p
2Yt6raj-S1M,"Which is not neccessary a bad thing. Who do you think make you iphone, cook your luchch, wash you car, drive your uber?"
2Yt6raj-S1M,I&#39;m almost done in a few months.
2Yt6raj-S1M,Lol same I never liked going to school because of their teaching system but I sill have to go
2Yt6raj-S1M,wtf dude lmao
2Yt6raj-S1M,No no i think it&#39;s PE
2Yt6raj-S1M,"basically, we fill our brains with useless stuff, but when it comes to school, we dump the good info and fill our brains with useless info because the adults told us that we&#39;ll live in the streets."
2Yt6raj-S1M,"John Royall ikr, I used to have the best memory ever. Now I can’t even remember what I had for supper last night or what I did in math yesterday. But I can remember the quadratic formula, a song from 4nd grade, and a picture I saw only twice during music class 8 years ago :/"
2Yt6raj-S1M,Truly superb comment 👍👌
2Yt6raj-S1M,Nya Da Neko same thing with Sam and dean XD but I tell my teachers about it they tell me to be quiet:( they teach us things for a quiz that we won&#39;t remember the year after that or we probably won&#39;t remember on our death beds they force you to do things you won&#39;t be interested in. People learn more from different parts of the world and Internet than they do school. Why? Because people are interested in it. Things you are interested in will stick with you. Teachers and People need to realize this! Not just teachers EVERYONE!!!
2Yt6raj-S1M,"Hence why i can still remember a song i sang in grade 3 while i can barely remember what I did last week for class. I can remember the smallest details about sam and dean from supernatural, but i cant remember the 4 different ways to solve an equation"

2Yt6raj-S1M,lol no. my brother got expelled from his school and got tossed into the loony bin
2Yt6raj-S1M,"According to the comment section, just do stuff that&#39;ll get you expelled"
2Yt6raj-S1M,Scort Mcbuzzkillington but I also think to a certain extent it is unnecessary for the majority of people to continue it after a certain age as you tend to know if you’re good at something or get enjoyment out of it soon enough.
2Yt6raj-S1M,Theelo5 you did not just say “clearly they failed you”😂😂😂😂😂😂 I’m not about to play.😭🤣
2Yt6raj-S1M,"Smelly Salty Socks <br>Possibly, however there aren’t as many passionate things you can do in school than you can outside."
2Yt6raj-S1M,"Pfft. You can still go to school and do your passion, that&#39;s just your choice."
2Yt6raj-S1M,Theelo5 it proves his point more tbh
2Yt6raj-S1M,"Clearly the school system failed you because you have pretty bad grammar. Great points though, the school system is meant to churn out factory workers, not entrepreneurs, which is a pretty great skill in the real world."
2Yt6raj-S1M,"Nickel Mgtow yes, by taxes just like lower education"
2Yt6raj-S1M,"Nickel Mgtow is the system then fixed, in your opinion, if education is free?"
2Yt6raj-S1M,"Most people hold themselves back (by excuses for example).    And lack of credentials is just an excuse (either get them, get work experience instead, or meditate so as to detach from the need for it.  Anyway you slice it, you are going to to need discipline.   Be a man, not a credential.  )"
2Yt6raj-S1M,They failed to learn new things not to give up actually everyone can also be failed in school or college
2Yt6raj-S1M,"Kids these days don&#39;t understand that. The education system is not created for the &#39;talented kids&#39;, it is created for the majority, normal kids that will never become the next steve jobs. Sadly, every kid thind he/she is so extrordinary these days."
2Yt6raj-S1M,It didn’t work
2Yt6raj-S1M,Sean Lin They dont have passion because they have yet to find passion in themselves.
2Yt6raj-S1M,"Jdabomb93, but the thing is, some people just don&#39;t have passion."

2Yt6raj-S1M,True
2Yt6raj-S1M,"Oh yeah, every time we &quot;learn&quot; something new, it just comes from a YouTube video that is poorly edited and only tells a third of what it actually is."
2Yt6raj-S1M,Or maybe just study and get better at math...
2Yt6raj-S1M,Bruce Stewart Anybody who agrees to this is just bad at math.

2Yt6raj-S1M,"Eaton Lin correct if the all the students in a school, stay home etc then the school would be close down, an no income would be made. So for teachers, an principals etc to keep their jobs, the kids have to stay in school aka The school system in a whole, worldwide"

2Yt6raj-S1M,Aren&#39;t there a <b>lot</b> of TED talks? I&#39;m sure there&#39;s a lot of other ones that the teacher didn&#39;t show you! Try to suggest it to them!

2Yt6raj-S1M,Foh home schools follow the same rubric smd
2Yt6raj-S1M,In many peoples cases homeschool could be bad for social skills and social understanding which are VERY important to become successful in most cases
2Yt6raj-S1M,Well first you might wanna take some grammar lessons
2Yt6raj-S1M,Bruh yeaah
2Yt6raj-S1M,Same bro.
2Yt6raj-S1M,Harith rashid wow

2Yt6raj-S1M,I literally never meet people with my last name
2Yt6raj-S1M,Omg woah we have the same last name
2Yt6raj-S1M,"Yeah, okay, I&#39;m not arguing over whether or not school is good or bad, because I also think that school is kind of pointless, though I don&#39;t think it&#39;s &quot;brainwashing.&quot; I&#39;m saying that there is no way that school making you dumber is the only reason the OP got lower grades in 6th grade than in 5th.<br>What about my comparative analysis skills, and what does that have to do with anything? What do you mean by &quot;the statistical insignificance of my statement&quot;?What statistics are you talking about?! Which statement?!"
2Yt6raj-S1M,Tahnee Thompson tank you
2Yt6raj-S1M,happy burger man your not listening to this little thing school tries to brainwash out of you its called &#39;critical thinking&#39; you say school gets harder as you go up yes thats true but they also dont prepare you in the slightest in elementary because they hold your hand through the early years then they suddenly chuck you into a place with no second chances much harder stuff etc etc and since you didnt learn at all how to cope with stuff like that you end up getting stressed af and start failing. i cant wait to hear a predictable reply like &#39;school is there to teach you basic knowledge not basic life skills&#39; or  &#39;insert generic insult&#39;
2Yt6raj-S1M,"I think I am listening. You are saying school is making you dumber because you receiver lower grades in sixth grade then in fifth grade, and I am disagreeing and saying that can&#39;t be completely true, because school tends to get harder the older you get, because they don&#39;t guide you and hold your hand through everything. What am I not listening to?"
2Yt6raj-S1M,happy burger man <b>facepalm</b> ur obviously not listening
2Yt6raj-S1M,"School makes us only learn about one solution, one way to solve it. Doesn&#39;t let us make a mistake that would actually change human history for the better, just the same thing."
2Yt6raj-S1M,"david15136 Yes, it can. School can also give you anxiety."
2Yt6raj-S1M,"i am 8th grade, and i had always thinking of not to go to school since it gives me alot of bad flashbacks."
2Yt6raj-S1M,Bruh 7th grade is easy af
2Yt6raj-S1M,That sounds personal
2Yt6raj-S1M,Don&#39;t give up ever.
2Yt6raj-S1M,"There are only 3 things you need to learn from school: Learn how to read, Learn how to write and Learn how to do the basic Math operations. The rest it&#39;s up to you. And, after you have learned those basic skills (that will actually help you in the future), you get to choose what are the other things or skills you want to learn. And I will add to those 3 skills: To learn a Foreign Language since a very young age, becuase this WILL help you for whatever you want to study in the future."
2Yt6raj-S1M,"Tell me, if you never went to school (and homeschool counts) and you tried to read a book, or do a simple equation like 6x5, would you be able to do it? Im not saying the school system is great, it can surely be changed but at least you learn something from it."
2Yt6raj-S1M,There is a Reason but we just Forget everything after it
2Yt6raj-S1M,"It&#39;s very unfortunate. School doesn&#39;t even teach memory, it just tests people on memory. However, we memorize things better if we are passionate about it."
2Yt6raj-S1M,That&#39;s a Global Constant<br>Going to School = More Depression
2Yt6raj-S1M,"Snipethemapples Oh and how to memorize stuff quickly and forget it all a week later, yep. I’ve learnt more from the internet I’ve learnt all of my time in school."
2Yt6raj-S1M,I’ve said this exact thing so many times lmao I’ve learnt more from the internet that’s useful than what I’ve learnt from all of my time in school.
2Yt6raj-S1M,"Snipethemapples ok but I was exaggerating, I didn’t mean I never learn from school cause it was just a joke"
2Yt6raj-S1M,"Lindsey Smith it would be &quot;(school, said no kid ever)&quot; not &quot;(said no kid ever, school)&quot;"

2Yt6raj-S1M,John Proctor ME TOOO
2Yt6raj-S1M,I end up forgeting what I learned as soon I exit the doors every day to go home. Its a wonder that I even get good grades...

2Yt6raj-S1M,i forget the things less than 1 week later lol

2Yt6raj-S1M,"Yup! Me too... School teaches us valuable information which helps in life but don&#39;t care about application of it in real life or if v even understood the material.... School assessments are just a test of our memory (except math... Where even if v had intelligence, they&#39;d shape it so that u think the same way always and not differently)"
2Yt6raj-S1M,Mp 42 fr tho
2Yt6raj-S1M,"im in 6th grade and i also absolutely love drawing. My school year this year is the first time i wasn&#39;t feared into learning art (because our art teacher last year would basically scream her head off if you put one line out of place) or not even being able to learn art (because after the mean teacher retired we had gotten one who didnt care) Irrelevant. Anyways, this year is the one year i actually learned art and enjoyed it but i wont be able to learn it anymore after this year because art isn&#39;t an elective for 7th-12th graders (i am literally dying on the inside) And all my teachers say &quot;if you wanna do something you gotta be good at it.&quot; and im like &quot;How?, How do you expect me to do what i love (which im pretty good at, top in my class) when im not going to be able to learn it for the next 5 or 6 years?&quot;"

2Yt6raj-S1M,"Hey Alice! I recommend listening to the Podcast &quot;Side Hustle School&quot; (5-7 min episodes, short and to the point!) and reading the Book &quot;Born for this&quot;, both things by Chris Guillebeau. He has an awesome way of helping you explore your interests and he also tells stories about people who have successfully created income while doing something they enjoy or are good at. It was very inspiring for me, I hope it helps you! <br>Also, I would recommend volunteering. Choose anything, anytime, just go out there and do something for someone other than yourself or your loved ones. I think this will make you feel useful and perhaps it will help you find purpose.<br>Good luck!!"

2Yt6raj-S1M,WrathGx look if you are forced to do something a conscious mindset change will not make it any less forced to actually get the benefits and not a placebo version you need to access your subconscious and tell it to start learning everything if you find a way to talk to your subconscious and you do it the right way you can get the full effect plus more
2Yt6raj-S1M,WrathGX big Brains don’t determine how smart you are. Actually smaller brains can sometimes be more efficient. After your brain has fully developed it doesn’t get bigger even if you learn all the knowledge in the world. And if your brain does get bigger go to the hospital bc thats dangerous
2Yt6raj-S1M,I agree. Rise above that mediocre memorization stuff. You&#39;ll annoy some teachers but amaze the good ones.
2Yt6raj-S1M,Accidentally threw my creativity in the temp folder along with my school &quot;Knowledge.&quot;
2Yt6raj-S1M,Why would she say give up?!? At least you drew something very better than the others and that’s all that matters.she actually needs to get fired too be honest because that can make kids suicidal.
2Yt6raj-S1M,maybe the teacher TOLD you to draw something. then it might actually be your fault
2Yt6raj-S1M,Nixian Reinan good for you stick up for what you believe in I believe in you and believe you can do whatever you want with your life no matter what anyone else says
2Yt6raj-S1M,Nixian Reinan they are just people who live in a box and cant see a different way
2Yt6raj-S1M,If you drew that profile picture yourself ignore your art teacher. Art is about being creative and doing what you want.

2Yt6raj-S1M,"Scar Ink I love drawing! I draw during school because its something I actually want to do. Or I write comics about my day with titles such as &quot;I dont feel like learning so I made a comic about stuff&quot;. My art class isnt as fun anymore. I like to free draw! <i>Not</i> draw something someone else wants me to draw so when its not what they want, I fail. In other words... Drawing is my talent."
2Yt6raj-S1M,Hey There yeah... and that is what school makes us to do... correct someone but not ourselves
2Yt6raj-S1M,gobsnobber muffin what ever I think of) but in art class we have to draw &quot;Like the classics&quot;
2Yt6raj-S1M,what do you like to draw?
2Yt6raj-S1M,Same (and I got worse at drawing) ALSO they said no doodling save that for art class but my art teacher didn&#39;t allow us to doodle too so my art got worse
2Yt6raj-S1M,"Killerbeez 0<br>I think the key here is whether it&#39;s home schooling or public schooling, kids should be allowed time to be kids. By this I mean they should be allowed to  play or do some creative stuff outdoors with their own peers."
2Yt6raj-S1M,Tahnee Thompson It&#39;s not a matter of the relationship that children have with their parents. You could hace the greatest relationship but still need privacy. You can&#39;t blame a need for privacy on the parents or the child: it&#39;s simply human nature to want to be alone at times. School is a very good example of how children can relax and have a down time without parents; even if they are learning.
2Yt6raj-S1M,Killerbeez well then the parents better start making a better relationship with the kids so they dont feel as uncomfortable as often
2Yt6raj-S1M,"Jackie Montrose It seems weird to think that someone would be uncomfortable in their own home, but not all children (especially teenagers) want to spend all day with their parents for five days a week for the whole school year. Constantly being in the presence of a parent can be uncomfortable at times."
2Yt6raj-S1M,Killerbeez 0 why wouldnt you be comfortable in your own home?
2Yt6raj-S1M,Exactly!!!

2Yt6raj-S1M,"School subjects are meant to develop young persons intellect not to make them experts in the field... They can forget everything once they leave the school - and there is no harm in that, but the important part is for them to learn how to think and apply that thinking once they are in the area that they are passionate about. I think that young people are simply just impatient these days and they feel that they are smart enough at age of 13-14 to make decisions for the life time and start feeling that the school is not allowing them to do that."

2Yt6raj-S1M,"<b>School really needs to start powering creativity.</b><br>Actually, it does. We take classes like art, writing, drama, etc. for a reason. From what I have experienced, the people with the more creative writing projects receive higher grades and attention from those who did not even input an ounce of creativity in their work. After all, they were asked to be highly creative. <br><br><b>...having us create a creative piece with our own minds, they made us do symmetrical butterfly&#39;s.</b><br>Where is the problem? Symmetry is an important part of art. When it comes to our bodies, the most beautiful ones are usually those that exhibit strong symmetry and balanced proportions. What you are doing is basic, but the advanced techniques will follow. If you have the time and money, you can surely take some art classes outside of school to bolster your skills. <br><br><b>School, Idont wanna grow up and work in a factory. I dont want to work in an office.</b><br>You do not have to. Some jobs do not require factory work or office work. These days, there are plenty of opportunities. <br><br>* But I dont need to know what a detrivore is to become successful*<br>Of course not. But knowing what a detritivore is is basic knowledge. It should not be that hard of a concept to grasp, but it gives you an understanding of how some aspects of the natural world works. For instance, some people do not care about photosynthesis, but when we understand its importance to our daily life, our perspective broadens. Indeed, knowledge is power. <br><br><b>Academics can get you somewhere, but creativity is what allows you to be successful.</b><br>There are people who you might argue are far from creative, yet they make decent pay. They study for several hours each day - sometimes they get stressed out - but in the end it is worth it. They get into top universities and score great jobs, but they did that by studying a lot. Not much creativity - just hours grinding and grasping material. I say working smart (a balance of academics and creativity) is the key to success (if we do not factor in good luck).<br><br><b>School is constantly trying to make you like everyone else; a high-grade successful student</b><br>Scoring high grades is something all students should be doing. Same goes with being a good family member. Or being a good citizen. This pressure is there for a good reason. People who champion higher grades, along with the addition of extracurriculars and community work, tend to get into the top schools, and thus are more likely to secure better jobs. <br><br>You do not have to be a student who gets high grades if you genuinely do not want to, but again it is something you should be doing. <br><br><b>They teach one way and one way only. Need another way to learn? Sorry kiddo! Get smarter, then you can learn.</b><br>That is not always the case. Some schools have programs that cater to students with learning disabilities. Being smart is not a prerequisite for learning - anyone can learn. Aside from students with special needs, if one needs help understanding something, then they should ask the teacher. It is their job to help you.<br><br>It is great that you have some creativity sparking. However, I think you should acknowledge that school is not as bad as you might think it is. Make the best out of your school experience - I am sure you will not lose creativity. <br><br>All the best."

2Yt6raj-S1M,"Alyssa Palacio Well, we live in an age where information is abundant and very accessible. School is a system that provides a foundation for education, but the truth of the matter is we spend just about every moment learning when we&#39;re awake. So long as you encourage you or your kids or whoever you know that, then that&#39;s already doing a lot. Though schooling is required by necessity, it&#39;s not the end and be all and in fact most of us really start educating ourselves when we&#39;re out of school, have jobs, or are just out in the world. Learning shouldn&#39;t feel like a chore."

I&#39;ll learn it the way I can acquire actual knowledge and trust me after that I actually started getting good grades in them too along with maths ,etc. And that is when I realised that &quot;change&quot; ..even at small level can be great specially if it&#39;s out-of-the-box"
2Yt6raj-S1M,Your wright. But what I think he is trying to say is that he memorized stuff for a test or something like that more than he learned stuff to use in the real world.

And I came out unable to do a single thing without permission. I&#39;m literally afraid to be in front of a line, to be spoken too, to go outside, I lost a part of myself, and I can&#39;t seem to get that confidence back. But I won&#39;t let them take away my heart. School has ruined me once already, I&#39;m not going to let it happen again. I don&#39;t care what they do to me, I&#39;m going to keep fighting for my passions because... it&#39;s all I have left."

2Yt6raj-S1M,"lisa 1D I&#39;m OK at maths, I think that&#39;s largely due to a particularly good teacher I had when I was eleven (she&#39;d spent many years in Nigeria teaching people to be maths teachers). However, as maths moves from everyday reality it seems to descend into some kind of arcane mysticism and it just seems pointless. I think Namma Apsu gave bery good advice: the more you can connect it with real things, the less it will appear like the credo of an insane religious cult."
2Yt6raj-S1M,In order to get at math all u gotta do is drop out when the quarter resets so u can have a perfect A when u get out

2Yt6raj-S1M,"Lol he realized early on in the game the current trend is a want to creativity, rebellion, startups, etc.... this guy is at least profitting of their idiocy. Most startups fail because it takes a lot of education to create something truly revolutionary. You have to educate yourself. Teachers can&#39;t make you do anything. Its all about you and your own willpower. Most tech billionaires have thousands and thousands of hours of background work behind their &quot;overnight&quot; success. They worked their asses off in learning math, science etc. You need the basics(taught in school) to move into the infinitely complex fields."

Suicidal rates have also been getting higher these past decades and many choose to ignore this issue. <br>Counselors- they are supposed to be dealing with these kinds of stuff. Ask you to come in their office, check out if anythings fine, but the schools i went didnt care much and they get paid more than teachers. Really what is the problem here"

2Yt6raj-S1M,all you learn on youtube is information given through videos
2Yt6raj-S1M,Mr. Line leaf DUDE YES! I want to start something myself if need be. Wanna start a Discord and change the school system?
2Yt6raj-S1M,"I agree with what your saying that teachers tend to get a bad rep for the wrong reason when it comes to the education system, I&#39;ll agree that not everyone can make it into the real world of whatever inspires them...  but I wouldn&#39;t call the education system a safety net; it is meant to be one, but it has become less of a safety net and more of a padded cell and at the same time you are wearing a complete layer of protective clothing. Instead of encouraging the kid to try and succeed while understanding there will be failures and that in all likelihood they won&#39;t be the best at what they want, all that matters to them is that the kid knows a little bit of everything but not enough of anything. Thus they never fully develop a passion or find their talent. I am going into my final year of college and I have found my passion and talent- but the education system never reached it for me (In my case, it delayed it because I did as was necessary at the time--getting good grades--and my passion was not involved in accomplishing that). What good is a standardized education for the whole if it holds back the participants from achieving greater in their passions. Do children need a safety net? Absolutely, but it can&#39;t be used for everybody, I think the safety net should be put into place through guardianship to nurture passion yet provide stabilization not standardized education that will always end up stunting the child&#39;s wanderlust. A completely customized education, as it were. Fitting the education to the child rather than vice versa."
2Yt6raj-S1M,"Infinus Official <br>Exactly!<br>It&#39;s not the schools, it&#39;s the system. <br>Teachers deserve so much more respect and pay, they have the most important job there is."

2Yt6raj-S1M,"I know, my school keeps limiting themes and trying to limit wallpapers on the chromebook, and limit things that help us, that is limiting creativity"

2Yt6raj-S1M,"That reminds me of my art class in freshman year. Art is about expressing yourself right? Well, apparently not, according to 90% of all my art teachers. They give us very specific things to do with very specific instructions. No expression at all, if I get it wrong somehow, it&#39;s wrong, it sucks, and it&#39;s not art. I hated that class."

2Yt6raj-S1M,"Army. Is. Everywhere, including here!!! :D ARMY"
2Yt6raj-S1M,"It needs to be more like preschool, in the sense that we can explore and play whilst we learn a great deal, as the teacher acts as a monitor and keeper of peace beyond the attempts of students"
2Yt6raj-S1M,"Students need control over their curriculum, outside mandatory facts. They need more flexible due dates, less high-stakes testing, and more of a friendly environment. Teachers need to become more like mentors and role models, while students search online for lessons and work together in teams to solve collaborative projects applying their knowledge. Assignments must be gradeless, but the resulting response to said tasks must not be left uncriticized. We need a more mentally challenging, stimulating, open education that benefits more gifted kids, as well as struggling kids. There will be no grade levels or classes, only a class and their society of collaborating factions, each at their own levels of learning, sometimes competing at the same level and joining forces to all learn the same thing"
2Yt6raj-S1M,"Devon Peabody that kind of mentality is sad and completely false. And if that theory of natural selection would turn out to be true in the future, you would be one of those to get rid of."
2Yt6raj-S1M,Zander Hash lol same
2Yt6raj-S1M,Joe P. Was smart until i went to this school i became less intelligent every grade i passed
2Yt6raj-S1M,Devon Peabody How old are you?
2Yt6raj-S1M,"Devon Peabody Well that&#39;s rather rude. That&#39;s pretty much looking at someone and deciding that they aren&#39;t worth living. <br>Personally, I do not believe that school is necessary for success in life.  There are, in fact, multiple examples of geniuses in history that completely flunked school, yet still became famous. Actually, Eddy Zhong, the guy in the video, pretty much proves it. School made him unmotivated. Did that mean that he was good for nothing?"
2Yt6raj-S1M,"I used to be able to space out for hours, listening to music, my mind would drift elsewhere and I would make my own movies. Then I would write them out. I haven&#39;t stopped writing, but I can&#39;t dream anymore. Not like that. I care for my dreams, and love them. Losing something like that because my mind is just drained from school was completely crushing. I still try, even though I lost the ability to do that almost three years ago. I&#39;ll lay in bed, listen music, and shut my eyes, but I cannot dream. And with that, my writing had become bland. There is no heart in it anymore. It&#39;s written well enough, but if you feel the tone of my work, there&#39;s no love like before."
2Yt6raj-S1M,"Hamburg  <br>Me too. I used to write 200 page stories when i was 11 but  i couldnt continue because school took away my time and it made me hate writing, i ended up telling myself to start writing again when i finish school. Now i finished school but... i lost all my ideas and imaginations."
2Yt6raj-S1M,Like me I use to draw these super detailed things on the side of my school work but I always got I. Trouble for it cuz I didn&#39;t focus on my work so I started to slowly stop drawing on my work and now I can&#39;t even draw a smiley face without erasing it x10 and retrying :/
2Yt6raj-S1M,Hamburg Yeah school has dwindeld my creativity by a LOT.
2Yt6raj-S1M,"Doing art is weirdly like flexing your arm or leg. If you stop using that limb, it becomes atrophied. But, &#39;stretching&#39; that muscle can bring it back to life. When I have felt stuck or out of ideas I found that it helped to look at others&#39; art, or to change something about my routine, shake things up and try to relax and remember how to play."
2Yt6raj-S1M,It teaches you problem solving skills

2Yt6raj-S1M,"exams are stress but as the anxious persob I am, any kind of forced projects or group projects give me even more anxiety and sttess"
2Yt6raj-S1M,Harrison Seymour Exams were actually originally meant JUST for seeing where you are at. the composer of the multiple choice test even said that it wasnt suitable for everyday public education.
2Yt6raj-S1M,"&quot;intelligence&quot; is a step up from a hot-key word... he only used it because he had no better word to use-intelligence is one of those vaguely-defined words. He couldn&#39;t use &quot;experience&quot; or anything like that because he himself is still at the lower levels of high experience. He wasn&#39;t using it to mean &quot;smart&quot; or as an educational standard, what he was talking about held no derogatory purpose... the majority of those &quot;less intelligent&quot; in his example would be passionate through labor or happy to be the simple &quot;doer&quot; of the job without having to deal with the stresses innovators and higher-ups would face. Basically, don&#39;t see/hear the word &quot;intelligent&quot; to be synonymous to smart, in this case its more closely aligned to &quot;progressive&quot;... people who are less likely to push to succeed further than he is. The thing is, he is not a professional public speaker (I wager he wasn&#39;t passionate about the public-speech aspect of the perks of doing the TedTalk, just felt it was necessary), and thus isn&#39;t as nuanced in the various connotative and denotative meanings of words and the repercussions behind different interpretations placed upon his vocabulary choice, so it is an excusable term for his purpose."
2Yt6raj-S1M,"Now, what if people made more effort getting their work done faster and on time, and didn&#39;t procrastinate. Then they would have a chance to do anything in their free time. I manage to have enough free time balancing Marching, Jazz, and regular Band, Robotics (which is a huge time commitment), and AP/advanced classes. People honestly waste too much time on social media, and then they complain about not having enough time to do anything. <br><br>My ideology is if you care about something enough and are passionate about it, you will make time for it. It may be really hard to balance work and kids, but you make sure your kids have the priority even though you need to work."
2Yt6raj-S1M,"Falling Galaxies I&#39;m going to highschool next year and if anyone asked me what I&#39;m doing in my spare time, I would tell them that I would be writing. Because that&#39;s what I want to do. I know a lot of other people that would love to pursue their dreams if their just given the time. <br><br>Maybe if we all just start chasing after those dreams to make it a reality, we&#39;ll be able to make good money doing it too. <br><br>Idk it&#39;s just my opinion."

2Yt6raj-S1M,Justin K. <br>Do someone have to be a dropout or can they just enroll into k12 online school ?
2Yt6raj-S1M,Jürgen Erhardt the point. Ithink at least. Of this speech is that you don&#39;t need to be good at school to be good at life. It&#39;s up to you to find out what your drive is. Where you succeed. And you can&#39;t do that until you.take up your own mantle and find your own passion
2Yt6raj-S1M,Jürgen Erhardt Thank you. For every Bill Gates there&#39;s 1000 people who need to work at McDonald&#39;s their whole life because they aren&#39;t properly educated.
2Yt6raj-S1M,"People lack the mindset to actually pursue what they want to do. I myself want to get into Computer Science which requires you to have a good understanding of math. At the time, I was bad at Math and even got a 330 on math in a PSAT. This opened my eyes to do something about it. I watched math concepts on youtube, took summer school( on my own will not because I needed to), and practiced math. My score went up to a 510 which is a decent score but there is still room left for improvement."

2Yt6raj-S1M,"Education is essential for everyone... but &quot;school&quot; (rather, a heavily standardized system) is not at all essential, not even for the general welfare of society, as it stagnates all but those who live life without a specified passion that requires depth. Eddy&#39;s approach may not have covered it quite as properly as he could&#39;ve (this isn&#39;t his passionate state, so naturally you can&#39;t expect him to easily express himself perfectly), however I feel he got his point across that while the system is not useless to everybody, its not beneficial enough to support society as an education system could and should- it digs up the top layer of a wide variety of possible passions (but not even close to everything) but fails to dig deep enough to grab a hold of the majority of attendees; and even if one of the subjects currently taught by the system sparks an interest in someone, it quickly gets smothered out by the rest of core curriculum forced upon them. Especially seeing as it continues for the majority of 13 years in the midst of the critical formative years of defining what kind of person they&#39;ll be... we could learn and retain the basics of understanding essential knowledge of life (fundamental math, science, et cetera) in about half that time. For the rest of the time it is wasted information and stress to those who aren&#39;t passionate to only know the basics and thus be a simple laborer."
2Yt6raj-S1M,"allwriteify Let&#39;s get to point from where he(Eddy) started.<br>He started of saying that &quot;school makes us less intelligent&quot;<br>i can&#39;t complety agree with Eddy....<br>Yes,schools do make some students less intelligent or say they don&#39;t gain much knowledge from what they study, only if the students are not interested in studying.<br>Nowadays,u can see that most students memorize what is given to them rather than comphrehending it.And that is what makes students less intelligent,but thier are students who see the beauty of physics,maths etc.and then they soon want to learn more about it.and you can&#39;t argue that learning more about physics or chemistry makes us less intelligent.<br>And Yes,it significantly contributes a lot to our creativity and thinking skills.(you may ask &quot;how&quot; and i may answer that on my next comment)<br>so in conclusion &quot;school is not for everyone,some may love it and some may not&quot; but in general it is essential for everyone.knowledge is essential for everyone.<br>Knowledge is Power!"
2Yt6raj-S1M,"I think you may have misunderstood what he&#39;s trying to say. He&#39;s saying school as it exists now doesn&#39;t encourage creativity, imagination, or problem solving. And those things matter in all kinds of professions. I see this at my kid&#39;s school. She listens to lectures, memorizes facts from textbooks, and then forgets it all soon after. The environment is also very regimented. And we live in a top school district. That&#39;s not an environment that&#39;s useful to anyone. High school diplomas have become worthless and it&#39;s becoming more necessary to have a college degree. Why is that? It&#39;s because employers don&#39;t feel that schools are creating thinkers or problem solvers. There needs to be a rethinking of how we educate."
2Yt6raj-S1M,"This does not change the fact that in Australia there are 48 million kangaroos and in Uruguay there are 3,457,380 inhabitants. So if the kangaroos decide to invade Uruguay, each Uruguayan will have to fight 14 kangaroos."

It takes me a couple minutes to think back and remember what I actually did. Even then, I never really &quot;learned&quot; anything. It&#39;s just a mindless cycle that I slug through every day. The education system NEEDS to change. I don&#39;t care what we have to do. I have my own dreams and goals, but I would dedicate my entire life to this cause if it would fix the school system."

Every day you enter the class you learn about other artists work how they got successful and then you have to all redraw their most famous peices. But art by definition isn&#39;t anything to do with anyone else and you won&#39;t learn it by staring blankly at a print of Pablo Picasso&#39;s Guernica. You only ever learn true art if you look at yourself your own reflection and pick up a pencil becuase with a blank page an open mind and a sharp point of grafite you&#39;ll never learn anything remotely artistic."

2Yt6raj-S1M,"+Alexander Breizh Je suis d&#39;accord avec toi sur la majorité de ces points; ma soeur est en Terminale et elle fait face a un grand nombre des dificultes que tu as citées. Personnellement, on n&#39;a pas le probleme des travaux de groupe en Anglais puisque l&#39;Anglais est l&#39;une, ou la langue qu&#39;on utilise le plus; meme depassant l&#39;Arabe, notre langue natale parfois. Non, je retire ce que j&#39;ai dit a la fin; ici, je sens que les langues sont plus ou moins egales puisque nous sommes trilingues et notre ecole suit le systeme francais avec un peu du systeme Libanais aussi (c&#39;est une ecole Franco-Libanaise a Dubai) donc on ne trouve pas de difficultes dans ce genre de choses. Par contre, puisque nous sommes libanais en majorite, notre Francais est un melange d&#39;Arabe, d&#39;Anglais et de Francais (c&#39;est tres special le libanais).. L&#39;expression a l&#39;ecrit est donc pas tres coherente chez ceux qui ne font pas d&#39;efforts supplementaires pour s&#39;ameliorer ou qui ne lisent pas de livres.<br>Enfin, je crois que le probleme des travaux de groupes est present dans n&#39;importe quel systeme educationnel. Quand le prof fait les groupes et que tu te trouves avec tous les delinquants, c&#39;est meme pas la peine d&#39;essayer. Autant dire au prof de mettre un zero tout de suite (Je DETESTE les travaux de groupe. C&#39;est toujours moi qui fais tout)<br>Anyways, merci pour cette conversation. C&#39;etait bien de parler de ce sujet avec quelqu&#39;un de si investi.<br><br>Bonne chance et a plus :)"
2Yt6raj-S1M,"@Marcel Bendaly ah oui c&#39;est vrai qu&#39;il y a eu la grande réforme du collège. Au lycée on a juste encore plus de travail qu&#39;avant  (normal j&#39;ai pas redoublé) et toujours pareil. Et aussi que des travaux de groupes en anglais. Quand t&#39;as un bon niveau et que tu te retrouves avec des mecs qui font encore l&#39;erreur de &quot;i have 16&quot; et que t&#39;es noté sur le travail du groupe et pas en individuel...<br>Mais c&#39;est vrai que ça a beaucoup changé pour vous. J&#39;ai eu l&#39;histoire des arts au brevet perso et au final j&#39;ai pas trouvé ça si désagréable mais si tu me dis que c&#39;est mieux maintenant alors je te crois ^^ <br>Perso j&#39;ai l&#39;impression que le système français se tourne plus vers la &quot;formatisation&quot; des élèves pour détruire la créativité et avoir des &quot;robots&quot; avec l&#39;illusion d&#39;avoir une liberté de pensée.<br>Par exemple en français on nous dit qu&#39;une dissertation argumenté sur des faits bien prouvé sera plus efficace et que le sujet d&#39;invention, et en seconde tu passeras TOUTE l&#39;année à travailler sur la dissertation. Un autre exemple, on a philo qu&#39;en terminale pendant seulement 1 an. Alors que c&#39;est LA matière qui permet de réfléchir totalement librement. Quand on voit le peu de personnes qui apprecient cette matière, on se dit que l&#39;école à réussi cette &quot;formatisation&quot;<br><br>Alors ça fait très anarchiste anti-conformiste comme &quot;discours&quot; mais c&#39;est ce que je ressens.<br><br>Si par hasard tu retombais sur cette discussion l&#39;année prochaine  (ce qui est presque impossible) dit moi ce que t&#39;en penses."

2Yt6raj-S1M,But even homeschooling is monitored by government in what you teach and how. I think I heard certain states require the parents to receive some &quot;training&quot; and permission to home-school their children... so its better than public school but not what is properly conducive to the child in nurturing passion.

2Yt6raj-S1M,"@WILSON!: You mean &quot;between <i>EDUCATION</i> and success&quot;. For some, the school system does indeed get them there, but for others, it doesn&#39;t."
2Yt6raj-S1M,"+Mecha MonsterCats, If it didn&#39;t work,  it wouldn&#39;t be called schooling! What is alternative schooling then? I think by definition it is still schooling. The difference between going to a &#39;book school&#39; and a &#39;trade school.&#39;"
2Yt6raj-S1M,"@Mecha MonsterCats And how are systems set up?  <br><br>And that&#39;s false.  The amount of people who choose alternative education in this country is not zero.  It might be small, but it&#39;s still there.  What is their outcome?  I understand an argument can be made that they have no chance because the consensus is to only hire people with high education credentials for higher paying jobs.  That is probably quite true, which is a shame, I agree.  However, if education is supposed to represent intelligence, rather than credentials (which is consistent with this kid&#39;s message), there would be a clear correlation with entrepreneurial success (a.k.a. success independent from the system) and alternative education.  But there isn&#39;t.  Generally, people who don&#39;t finish high school are not found in the library soaking up information like sponges, so to speak.  The arguments made by this kid and others like him are driven by stark minority statistics of figures such as Steve Jobs, Larry Ellison, and Bill Gates.  Each of those people achieved incredible success and wealth, and were all college dropouts.  However, Bill apparently did very well in school up until that point.  All of them were sponges for information outside of school.  <br><br>Now, here is another thought you might find interesting, which this kid got right.  Successful entrepreneurs tend to challenge the status quo.  Well, for that to happen, the status quo must exist first.  Also, could it be possible, they&#39;ve been trained, albeit indirectly, to challenge the status quo.  By disagreeing with the platform of traditional schooling, and perhaps faltering in that category, or being antisocial, they develop skills at an early age which they use to challenge that perceived opposition.  Now, imagine if we flipped it on it&#39;s head, and made school more free thinking.  Well, we might find the next generation of Steve Jobs&#39; getting PhD&#39;s, as that would then be the challenge of the status quo!  <br><br>I think, with the system we have now, we&#39;ve done a pretty damn good job of improving the standard of living, creating breakthroughs in technology and innovation.  We&#39;re mastered the skill and efficiency of gathering food, water, and shelter.  This is driven largely by people who break out of the social norms of organized school systems, but also largely by the people who do incredibly well in school and become high ranking executives, designers, architects, engineers, etc.  I feel pretty safe driving over the bridges in my neck of the woods.<br><br>sorry for the long comment."
2Yt6raj-S1M,"Because the system is set up that way, and people aren&#39;t educated on any alternatives to schooling. And there&#39;s a stigma against people that object schooling"

2Yt6raj-S1M,"Guillaume Landaburu <br>The point is that either way, school is restrictive. I need to know 0% of what I&#39;m supposed to be learning in school.

I should be, but instead I go to school and learn some bullshit I don&#39;t need to know for 7 hours a day. Then some daysI work for 6 hours after that. If it weren&#39;t for school I could be making more progress"
2Yt6raj-S1M,you are absolutely right
2Yt6raj-S1M,"First, I never suggested my judgment was &quot;god like&quot;, where do you find such a sentence? And next about his facts, yes his story has a happy ending, but he belongs to an extrem minority of people having such an happy ending while dropping out of school. He seems to be really intelligent and strong, and that&#39;s why he can&#39;t understand how dangerous his ideas are. He did manage to be happy and succeed without school, good, but not everyone can achieve the same. The safest way to get both social achievement AND self empowerment remains education. He might be able to self-educate himself, but again he belongs to a minority there. Schools are the only way (for now) to receive such proper education as long as you accept it.<br><br>So to make it short: you want education and self empowerment? Dont listen to Eddy Zong and go to school. Social achievement is just something thats comes along the way when you got the previous 2, and you are almost sure to get those at school. And if you feel social pressure at school then the way you perceive school is wrong, or you met some nasty people. If you see school for what it really is, a place where pure knowledge and wisdom are shared, then there is absolutly no reason to leave nor not to take advantage of it. If you see school as a pupil standardisation process, then we disagree on what it is .<br><br>&quot;I can guarantee your liducrously undereducated&quot;: personnal attacks mean you have no more reasonable point to make. And it gets worse when you just quote someone out of context. No investigation? I wrote my reasoning up there. I&#39;m still open to the debate but come with some more reasoning than just a &quot;you are wrong and here&#39;s an Einstein quote to tell you you are ignorant&quot;."
2Yt6raj-S1M,"Guillaume Landaburu why are you suggesting your judgement on him is God like? It ironic you do not hear your hypocrisy, your condemnation of Eddy Zhong&#39;s presented facts and ideas are only to belittle pro active students from seeing success, and now  societal accomplishments does not necessarily equate self empowerment or having been educated, I can guarantee your ludicrously undereducated.  Einstein once said those people who instantly deny there is a societal norm bubble &quot;condemnation without investigation is the highest form of ignorance.&quot;"
2Yt6raj-S1M,FuriousFajita a the only crazy person here is you <b>kid gets to choose whatever they want to learn and they can drop out any time to experiment with other things yet they are somehow pressured because reasons</b>
2Yt6raj-S1M,Jimmy Cuevas That&#39;s what college and university is for.
2Yt6raj-S1M,"Jimmy Cuevas if you truly believe that this is a good idea then you are mad as a swan. This would put pressure on the kids who don&#39;t know what subject they want study more of  to make a hasty decision  choose a subject  and it may result in them choosing something that they don&#39;t enjoy and since that they would have little skills in other subject areas they will live their life doing something they hate. this would cause them to regret this decision for the rest of their lives. furthermore, chances are that they are too young and not informed and or  experienced enough in a subject area to make a decision that will have the chance to ruin their lives. just imagine the anxiety too, the influence of the parents and peers etc. "

2Yt6raj-S1M,"DelireWeb I think it&#39;s more so about our educating system as opposed to the idea of school. The current educating system, like the guy in the video said, is focused on the conventional notion of success (diploma, good college, stable job, etc), and in doing so ignores the fact that there is more to intelligence than academics; there is also creative intelligence. Not everyone (including myself) wants to live such a mundane, punch-clock, type of life, of course that is just my opinion others are fine with it. His point is that we should encourage kids to explore their options and not hold them to conventional careers paths because it isn&#39;t the only way to find &quot;success.&quot; Of course one&#39;s environment plays a part also, but he never argued it didn&#39;t."

2Yt6raj-S1M,"@rr pringles<br>lol yeah, I won&#39;t debate that one.. Fact is that parents have a hard time to educate their children, most have simply abandoned the task... There are so many noises outside the  familly, especially from the media environment (who mistakingly assert that they don&#39;t have any influcence over education). The school is essentially a resonating chamber of such environment (apart from the knowledge they give out)."

The school one or two &#39;&#39;support groups&#39;&#39; (im not sure how you call them) per grades for students a little behind, while they would have needed 1 or 2 more.

2Yt6raj-S1M,"I skimmed this, but you may want to be informed that TEDx is free to attend, and has always been. Other than that quick fact that I just pointed out, I want to leave the rest to perhaps a therapist. I&#39;m seeing very heavy symptoms of the Projection Phenomenon going on in your thought process, and I trust it&#39;s not only negatively affecting me. <br><br>Thank you for your input."
2Yt6raj-S1M,"Hi Eddy.  Thank you for the exception of your response.  I will honor you in kind with an attempt to clarify where I was unclear, such as in the quoted sentence.<br>   What I meant to express was that, we are all egocentric from birth.  We are enamored of our own story.  Nothing could be more amazing to us than ourselves.  What young people rarely recognize, is that each member of their audience is similarly interested in his or her own story.  When we listen to fiction, or non-fiction for entertainment, we substitute ourselves for the protagonist, to feel what he/she feels, so that it becomes our temporary substitute story.<br>   But, when it comes to a forum for people to share ideas, not stories, what people are looking for is the idea.  They don&#39;t care about the presenter personally; they want to, indeed, just as you said, &quot;use him (or her) for his ideas,&quot; though that&#39;s a rather negative way of putting it.  We hunger for useful ideas.  New ideas.  In truth, even fiction is only entertaining if it presents some new idea.<br>   When young people gather in groups, they each talk about themselves, and often, rather than listening to each other, they simply await their turn to speak about their self.  If you get on stage, and just talk about yourself, though your story can not but be fascinating to you, it seems boring and pointless to an audience that is holding you to adult standards, because the idea, the revelation of new concept or perspective, is what is awaited by the audience.  That is what is potentially useful to the audience.<br>   When it comes to your idea, I&#39;m not even sure what it is, unless it is that schools don&#39;t teach creativity or that you can drop out of school and start a business.  Let me put that into perspective.   There are people, adults, often former educators, who have taught in schools for 30 years, then traveled around to hundreds of schools around the country, read books on education theory and practice, and the philosophy thereof, the politics surrounding it, researched and lived American education for decades, maybe written a book themselves, maybe, examined where the intentions break down or where the intentions are faulty to begin with, spoken with boards of education.  And they have interesting insights to share on precisely the subject of &quot;how school makes kids less intelligent,&quot; and other related subjects.  They offer thoughtful analysis.   Some of them do TED Talks.<br>   Compare that to your talk about yourself with no offered insight into the nature of the education system and how it makes kids less intelligent.  You didn&#39;t even make that claim in your speech; in fact you retracted it.  When you finally got around to your point it was something to the effect that..&quot;er.. well, Schools don&#39;t really make kids less intelligent; they teach a certain kind of intelligence; they just um, maybe don&#39;t teach creativity.&quot;   You sat us through - what was it, 15 minutes - of waiting for you to make your argument only for you to say at the end, effectively, &quot;just kidding, I&#39;m not making that argument.&quot;  That&#39;s click-bait.  It&#39;s irritating.   The irony is that the argument you claimed to intend to make could be made, and you don&#39;t seem to know it.<br>   Even if the notion that schools don&#39;t do a good job of teaching creativity were an idea new enough to be worth sharing, your speech doesn&#39;t even make that case.  It does not follow from the fact that you dropped out and became a successful business entrepreneur that schools don&#39;t teach creativity.  It&#39;s non sequitous.  It happens that schools don&#39;t do a good job of that, but you failed to make the case or even attempt to make it.<br>   You claimed the time and, I can only assume, expensive attendance fee of, what, hundreds of adults? - who paid to hear your great ideas worth sharing with the world at their expense, to stand there and basically, boast about your personal success.<br>   To be fair, a lot of people do that, and most of the kids&#39; talks do that.  It&#39;s embarrassing, but understandable:  the self is fascinating.  But if you have any interest in further public speaking, I think you will be aided in such endeavors by an understanding that the audience can&#39;t wait for you to finish talking about yourself and get to the point.  And you better have a point worth talking about <b>to your audience.</b>  One that, in other words, is useful to them.  Because, yes, if you&#39;re not there to be used for your ideas, what are you there for?<br>   Perhaps it will help if I offer an example that isn&#39;t you.   Right before or after your speech, I watched one from a girl, also a kid, from Iran, talking about how she moved from Iran to America, and all the little associated anecdotes.  And if there was a point I don&#39;t remember it now.  I&#39;m pretty sure there wasn&#39;t.  She just wanted to claim everybody&#39;s time to tell her story, under the guise of having an idea worth sharing that never materialized.<br><br>   Let&#39;s say you were an Austrian patent clerk, and you figured out that gravity is the result of curves in space-time.  And while giving a speech about it, you mentioned, anecdotally, that you figured it out while you were a patent clerk.  That would be okay, because it&#39;s brief, and you&#39;re getting to an idea worth sharing.<br>   If on the other hand, you were that same Austrian patent clerk, and you gathered the great physicists of the field before you on a momentous occasion to give an important speech about a new idea you&#39;d come up with that people should hear, and then you just told them about your life growing up in Austria and how you worked in a patent office, and how you like your coffee, and then that was it...  or your grand conclusion was, &quot;so it turns out, you can grow up and be a patent clerk,&quot;  well, that would be fucking irritating and a rude waste of everyone&#39;s time.  The idea would be unworthy of the audience.<br>   We&#39;re not physicists, nor geniuses.  No one&#39;s expecting space-time.  We were expecting a discussion and analysis, with new ideas, one at least, supporting the idea that schools actually make kids less intelligent.  You did not deliver on your promise.  Instead, we just got your life story.  You wasted everyone&#39;s time.  Time they could have used to listen to somebody with actual deep insight on the subject, making the actual argument.<br>   There.  I hope that I have managed to convince you that your talk was, indeed worthless.  I mean no offense by that.  I am only stating it as I would state that my desk is brown and the sky is blue.  As per your request, I did not tone it down for you.  And though I was, and remain, irritated, and wrote bluntly, I hope you will not infer any enmity, for I have none.<br>  I just don&#39;t believe that doing the normal polite adult thing of smiling uncomfortably and saying &#39;good job; that was wonderful&#39; is really in anyone&#39;s best interest.  I have done you the courtesy of not pretending.<br><br>Oh, before I go, I should give an example:  In school, grades are effectively an incentive system: rewards and punishments on a scale of A to F respectively.   The teacher gives information.  It may be true or false.  It may be perfect or flawed.  There could be more to add to the information, arguments to be made against the provided information.    But the student will be tested on how much of the information he/she has learned.  The way to get an A is to give back the information exactly as it was taught, to memorize and regurgitate.  This is not a case of bad teachers; it is inherent and systemic, because the teacher is required to teach what he/she believes to be most true, and therefore is rightly expected to grade according to the degree of differentiation from what he/she taught, with the highest grade going to zero difference.<br>   One can easily deduce from this perspective that the extent of one&#39;s creative thinking about the material provided, the degree to which one adds, or detracts or amends or denies the validity of the provided information, is the extent to which ones grade becomes less than A, down towards F.<br>   Thus, we can clearly see how the grading system stifles creative thinking - how that is inherent to the system, a structural flaw, it could well be argued, that we, as a society, might consider addressing in some way.<br>   There are many things like that to be presented and considered about the educations system.  There was nothing like that in your talk, which is understandable because you&#39;re just a kid, or young man, sorry, who doesn&#39;t know anything about it.   But then what were you there for?  Why did you want to do a TED Talk?  For prestige or something?   Live some decades, have experiences, reflect, contemplate, maybe research if your interest involves facts, learn about something in depth, while doing other things, banging chicks, traveling the world, growing your business, raising kids, or live a totally new kind of life, and if you ever come up with an idea worth sharing, by all means, share it, like Jesus, like Einstein.  But don&#39;t just do a TED Talk because it seems like a cool upwardly, sophisticated, prestigious thing to do, when you don&#39;t know anything about anything, or have any new perspective."
2Yt6raj-S1M,"Hi &quot;BrindleBriar&quot;, <br><br>I usually don&#39;t respond to comments on my TEDx, but this was interesting. I appreciate you giving it to me with no political correctness, even if you toned it down at the end. I&#39;m not offended, but I have to disagree.<br><br>&quot;Kids, especially modern kids, have trouble grasping that:  nobody wants to hear about YOU, just the idea you have.&quot;<br><br>Where do the ideas come from if the kids don&#39;t exist in the first place? Many people care about kids. You make it sound like society is using them for their ideas, which, by the way, are not necessarily the most valuable trait that they contribute to society. <br><br>Oh, and I&#39;ve read your post a couple times from beginning to end, and the only supporting argument for the assertion that my idea is worthless is that <b>you</b> already know about it. Does that make it completely useless for everyone else?<br><br>If you would care to respond to this, clarify this point for me and especially what qualifies as a &quot;kid&quot; to you. Also tell me what other supporting arguments you have for the assertion that my ideas are worthless. If you&#39;re right, then perhaps I&#39;ll be convinced that my talk was indeed worthless. As of now, I&#39;m not.<br><br>And don&#39;t tone it down because I&#39;m what you define as a &quot;kid&quot;<br><br>Thanks,"

2Yt6raj-S1M,"Because &quot;doing whatever you want&quot; is not going to teach you to think, to use different parts of your brain, to be responsible, or to tackle ideas and tasks that may not be pleasant but still need to be done. It will not fit you for a job, a career, or a relationship. You better know exactly what you&#39;re talking about before you waste a hard-working teacher&#39;s time with your infantile &quot;challanges&quot; [sic]. Ironically, the only way to learn enough to know what you&#39;re talking about it to pay attention in school!"
2Yt6raj-S1M,We have a thing like that called &quot;Personal Project&quot;
2Yt6raj-S1M,"Luna Wolf The fact that you say this about history illustrates the failure of our education system. Many of the parts of the common core are meant to instill certain skills but they ultimately fail to do so. History is extremely important. Whether or not the subjects of history are dead or not is irrelevant. Their actions created the world we live in and in order to understand it we have to study its history. As the saying goes, those who do not know history are doomed to repeat it. If we don&#39;t learn from the mistakes of the past how will we prevent future challenges? How will we stop the next Hitler if we do not understand his methodology? I&#39;ll stop before my ranting gets worse."
2Yt6raj-S1M,"Well, It&#39;s not certain that you&#39;ll be a successful developer. Which is why you can&#39;t work on that until you&#39;re out of school."
2Yt6raj-S1M,Maybe you need music classes to make your brain work the right way. You don&#39;t always know what&#39;s best for you. You only know what you feel like doing. Welcome to real life--we have to do things we don&#39;t feel like doing sometimes.
2Yt6raj-S1M,"@William H. Harrison Doing homework is useless and a waste of time just like schools nowadays. If there were  enough teachers that make you understand what they are saying by entertaining you everything would be a lot better.

2Yt6raj-S1M,"Oh also, here&#39;s a little secret: just because a lot of people say Asians are super smart, it doesn&#39;t mean it came to them naturally, it&#39;s because they busted their asses studying day and night.

2Yt6raj-S1M,"coolz123123 Honestly, I didn&#39;t read what you wrote, I skimmed it. I get what you mean but the truth is lots of parents&#39; don&#39;t teach these things for whatever reason (some justifiable others not so much). Therefore, schools should work towards educating us on these important matters because that&#39;s what school is. Why not just have parents teach their kids everything important? But who defines that. You say taxes and mortgage. I say math. Who gives a shit? Your family background shouldn&#39;t have much of an influence on your education (ideally) but I know that&#39;s not always the case."
2Yt6raj-S1M,"Beth -182 What? How is does your question have any correlation what so ever to what I said and on top of that, what you&#39;re saying yourself isn&#39;t correlated. <br><br>&quot;You can&#39;t put that responsibility on parents&quot; &quot;I was raised in a foster home&quot; just because some people are born in a foster home, does that exclude all extra responsibilities that a parent should have and a parent should treat their children the same way foster homes do? No, regardless if a person has parents, is homeless, is in s foster care or anything, generally parents need to teach their children these important topics.<br><br>As far as your second question goes, obviously it would be extraordinary if schools taught these topics l, but what I stated clearly was, schools will not teach kids these things, not that schools shouldn&#39;t."
2Yt6raj-S1M,coolz123123 You simply cannot put that responsibility on parents. I grew up in Foster Care. Did I or all the other kids without parents not deserve to be taught about these topics?
2Yt6raj-S1M,"Some teachers take the time and trouble to keep students motivated and interested, but that&#39;s above and beyond. It&#39;s not really their job. Take some responsibility."
2Yt6raj-S1M,"The evidence is simply the results of what we see today, unless you think that is merely natural? I never said parents want to dumb down their kids, but the whole system is horrible environment for kids. After so many decades have past and our world has literally changed and our minds has developed we still run the same identical school systems. I&#39;ve seen teachers disrespecting students (yes students disrespect teachers and they need to be disciplined)  and it is obvious those teachers only have trained how to teach their specific subject and nothing about how to relate to a student, how they want to be treated and respected as well as how to keep them motivated and interested (again I&#39;m not ignorant and saying all teachers are bad and all cannot relate to students, because each teacher has their own talents) <br><br>Also your comment was very brief in saying I have no idea without pointing out why you think that is? Using the skill you mentioned just now would be quite helpful."
2Yt6raj-S1M,munchichi8 i cant get homeschooled because my parents work a lot...
2Yt6raj-S1M,My mom tried homeschooling. Then my sister and I drove her crazy that she sent us back to public school. Homeschooling isn&#39;t for everyone. There should be a change in the education system.

Really good artwork for its day, some would still hold up today. But if the teachers saw it they&#39;d say nope. Looking at the back of many of my exercise books you&#39;d see artwork (that&#39;s where I&#39;d put it :) )"

And, yes, they do have to ask my permission to go to the restroom or to get a drink, because if I don&#39;t know where they are all the time, they&#39;ll take 25 minute restroom breaks to smoke pot in the bathroom, or leave school property and get hit by a car, and then their parents will sue.

You get to learn stuff in the comfort of your home, you’re not treated like a mindless drone product, your parents will teach you actual important stuff for life, you get to sleep in and stay up, and most of all, you’re with your family.

2Yt6raj-S1M,"+Meloetta Kawaii Not the schools fault? The way you&#39;re using language is misleading and confusing you and everyone else. Look at it this way. Schools provide a service, children attend and receive. Even at the age of teen-hood and you have no way of determining on time whether something is bullshit or there are better alternatives, thus you must rely on the elders who are guiding you have developed those capabilities. By the time you&#39;ve truly realised that it is all a whole load of crap, you&#39;re 18 and have gone through most of your formal education, and for many it takes even longer.<br>The burden of committing to change is not the children or teenagers but the adults. You seem to make this point in your last sentence, but strangely throughout your comment you are making the attempt to shift the responsibility from the only ones who can make a difference.<br><br>Also what you&#39;ve done is fall or reiterate the fallacy that is freedom without choice. &quot;Doesn&#39;t work for you get up and go somewhere else&quot;; where exactly? When you don&#39;t have the resources to crate alternative spaces how on Earth can you assume that responsibility? This is the bottom line, schooling has certain aims, and it doesn&#39;t achieve those aims, thus it should be changed and the only ones who can do that are adults who through experience and careful analysis can determine what is the ultimate system.<br><br>I mean who the hell is going to do the rewiring? 17 year-olds?"

2Yt6raj-S1M,"But what is this even about. You think that it&#39;s not necessarily that our formal education institutions are flawed in some particular way, but rather that the students, for whatever reason, or not in the right gear to appreciate or take it on. Whether that be because of their upbringing, the attitude they&#39;ve developed because of leniency, low expectations, developed laziness, naivety, immatureness, or perhaps personal issues etc.. Am I right?<br><br>Perhaps. But perhaps it&#39;s actually to do with the threshold different people have for tolerating boring shit. ... Now I wanted to make a claim about the years year 7 to 9, but I don&#39;t remember and it&#39;s not that important. What I can give is a decent illustration about parts of my GCSE experience and certainly A-levels.<br><br>In my opinion those who do well, in our dry-ass education system, are those with the most discipline. I noticed over the years my tolerance for things I do not want to do went down and down and deteriorated. It started with GCSE Biology, and its nature of having to learn bodies of knowledge, while battling through English Lit/Lang and its stressful essay nature till the very end when I felt I could never touch the subject after that last exam again, and then on to Chemistry AS level where I just could not get myself to pay attention in class or tolerate it.<br><br>The thing is though, these are all interesting things (exc Literature, may or may not be the case, I will study it anew to find out...). It is only after a certain lapse of time that I want to learn these things, not &#39;again&#39; mind you, but anew. I did well and now study Maths at university, but that is simply because I was good at it, nothing more. I never found it challenging, and darn them too for that for they probably cost me much cognitive development... perhaps you notice my begrudge-ment, or disappointment/dissatisfaction for a lighter word...<br><br><br>I am talking too much. Is Eddie&#39;s problem that he wasn&#39;t &#39;ready&#39; or in the right frame of mind to engage with his learning? Or is the fact of the matter he was a questioner before all of us were and could not see or accept why he had to spend his days participating in activities which he did not find the least engaging?<br><br>I can&#39;t say, not in his particular case or those like him. It might just be the case his parents let him be a lazy fuck, or he became one all on his own. Or it might be that this kid is naturally(/genetically) of a different nature of which finds it harder to sit still in class and be disciplined to sit in a boring-ass class. I&#39;ll tell you this for sure. If I found all my classes like GCSE Biology or AS Chemistry, I don&#39;t know where I would be right now."
2Yt6raj-S1M,"@Bruce Wayne And I guess you&#39;re one of the &#39;better&#39; batch, eh?<br><br>I&#39;m not gonna sit here and say there aren&#39;t rooms full of kids who just chat and chat away, especially if the teachers let them. Back in my GCSE&#39;s from year 10-11, we had a (good) teacher who was exactly like that; his logic was he taught the material for some of the lesson, and let the students to what they will afterwards. Me and my mate just got on with work, but 95% of the rest just messed about away, even the so-called nerdy smart kids...<br><br>So I&#39;m not gonna deny that some people just aren&#39;t attentive in class. The thing is though school for most people is a load of shit, it&#39;s not engaging and truth be told actually causes most people to hate most subjects. Not all of us can go to Eaton and get that sort of education. (Even then I suspect their premise is flawed...).<br><br>My argument is not about that. I could care less, in this particular discussion, whether people are using the opportunities, however mediocre, available to them. That is a different discussion and rooted in various other, psychological factors. For instance consider far-eastern, african, in fact probably children in every part of the world apart from the US, UK and possibly many other European nations. It&#39;s a strange phenomena.. well actually it&#39;s not it can be explained pretty easily, people actually have a solid culture of respecting their elders and society in those cultures (to good or bad)..."
2Yt6raj-S1M,"@***** No, we do have an influx of lazy fucks in our school system. You don&#39;t have to try anymore to get good grades in our new &quot;No Child Left Behind&quot; program, yet we have failures left and right. Whether or not Eddie matches that description isn&#39;t the point; there are many children that do. "
2Yt6raj-S1M,"@Bruce Wayne There is reason to complain friend. People are being put off school and various subjects not because they are lazy fucks, but because the way we do things is disengaging. The system could be better, much better.<br><br>This Eddie&#39;s rebellion is symptomatic of a real problem in formal education. And so those core problems must be addressed, and then the rest will follow. The way we do education needs to be totally redesigned, but I can&#39;t be bothered to go into that."

2Yt6raj-S1M,"I&#39;ve never met a person who wasn&#39;t creative. I&#39;ve met hundreds of people who lack the skills to explain their ideas. <br>School should be the process by which we acquire the hard skills to make our ideas possible, rather than a place where we memorize standardized information and are encouraged to keep quiet and sit still for 8 hours a day"
2Yt6raj-S1M,"+Drake Santiago I agree that the education system should not be abruptly abandoned. Yet I must disagree with you that the world needs non-creative people. Creativity, I think, is our gift to us as human beings. It is the thing we do that nothing else can do. We can build machines and contraptions to perform automated tasks, not to be creative. We should not strip ourselves of our innate creative traits. <br><br>While not everyone can be an entrepreneur, everyone can still be creative in their work, and also outside of their work. <br><br>If we begin to value human development, both as a society and as individuals, more than we value large-scale production of material goods, I believe we shall find that we can move towards a world in which no-one must perform meaningless work. Where we can all have meaning in our life&#39;s work, for meaning is not derived from the external world, it is derived from our internal perception of the world. <br><br>Thus it is not on what is without we should look to, but to what is within."
2Yt6raj-S1M,"@***** I wholeheartedly agree. The low wages we pay those in service and manufacturing is appalling, and it becomes a big impediment for them to move up in the world. Unfair income distribution is something that needs to be addressed.  "

2Yt6raj-S1M,"@***** <br>Yes, it really is tragic. Fortunately, we as tutors can make a difference to some extent, since we aren&#39;t as restricted as teachers and have more experience with students who have problems."

What I want most for my students is for them to figure out their talents- what they love doing and are good at- and find a way to put that talent to work for them. <br>If you feel you are wasting time in college, then drop out and work for a while, maybe you&#39;ll decide to go back and finish, or maybe you won&#39;t, but if you feel you&#39;re wasting your time, find something that doesn&#39;t feel like a waste.<br>I had no clue what to do after getting my two-year degree, so I just studied something I liked, Spanish, and worked for a year. Realized through tutoring other Spanish students that I wanted to teach, transferred to University, graduated, traveled, and now been teaching for two years. Forcing yourself to go to college when it all just feels &#39;meh&#39; is a terrible way to find and develop your talents."
2Yt6raj-S1M,"+philxcorexinxurxface i know how you feel, i want to become an entrepenuer when i graduate high school. seems like my peers are going to college, find a job work for so and so years then do their 401k and retire, they&#39;ll just be average and they will not be finacial free/independent or have a good life."

2Yt6raj-S1M,"@***** Eddy, I had no idea you would be reading this yourself. Thanks for your response!<br>So the first one really was five months long? Wow!

2Yt6raj-S1M,@Peter H. sorry peter thats just who I am and how I talk. I&#39;ve tried the be nice route and its never worked for me.<br>people who refuse to do any research into a subject and then try to act like they know what they are talking about irk me.<br>he is all yours to teach im dealing with 5 others right now.
2Yt6raj-S1M,"@Alexia Richardson I think you are being unfair to @*****.  He has been believing people he thought he could trust, all the will being being mislead.  It is a lot to take on for anybody and wanting an affirmation from him that he has been mislead by people who have likely been mislead themselves, people he might love.<br>You could be more considerate of others feelings.  It is way to much information for JustIdea to accept at first glance. <br><br>@***** I have been enjoying our conversation so please, if you have any further questions please ask."
2Yt6raj-S1M,@***** you did in fact say they are the same and you were again WRONG
2Yt6raj-S1M,"@jpr422 You should read George Will&#39;s latest Op Ed, &quot;Defining Economic Failure Down&quot;.  He points out that this society has &quot;defined down&quot; standards across the board the past few decades. In the past few years I&#39;ve come to realize that in this culture excellence must come from within.  It is not Politically Correct for teachers and parents to push young people the way they pushed prior to the seventies.  You have to set high standards for yourself.  If your work is substandard you know it.  You have to be the one who decides it&#39;s unacceptable.  If you maintain high standards with time someone else will notice, that&#39;s the point at which opportunity and preparation meet.  Anymore, college has more to do with indoctrination than education.  That&#39;s the reason Barry promotes it so much."
2Yt6raj-S1M,"The sad part of it is, is that the bar is being lowered more and more for academic excellence. What was considered just average grades thirty or forty years ago, are now grades that are worthy of only honor students today. There are too many illiterate students graduating from college now."
2Yt6raj-S1M,"@***** I wish I had grown up in your generation. When I was your age, the thing that was instilled in young people then was the very thing you talked about: go to school, follow the curriculum religiously and you will succeed in life and no one questioned it. The schools, the teachers and the parents knew what was best for us. I always felt that there was something lacking, but didn&#39;t know what, exactly. How is this education going to help me in the business world? When I went to college we were taught a lot of theory, but very little practical knowledge. Many of the subjects were a waste of time, because it was not really preparing us for the real world. Fortunately, I went to a technical school to learn a skill and a trade, but never that ability to think for myself. Thanks Eddy, for the inspiring talk. "

jr_hK2Owq8o,"Eleanor Hare Thank you for the reply :)<br><br>I get what you meant. The human interaction certainly play an important role.<br><br>But as the technology advanced, I’ve seen many interactive educational Apps on iPADs or talking pens in some child English education products. Do you think the new tools can change the conclusion found in the case study you mentioned if we just aim at 70% as fluent as a native speaker?<br><br>I truly hope that some linguists can study this topic so we can know if those English products are just something to get money out of parents’ pocket:)"
jr_hK2Owq8o,"In theory, it should be possible, but it isn&#39;t. The case study of Jim, the hearing child of deaf parents, is a classic example. They taught him minimal sign language but exposed him to huge amounts of TV, radio etc. yet his linguistic abilities were poor until he started working with a speech therapist, when his abilities really grew. This shows that interaction is very important in language acquisition.  While the children listening to the CDs etc may indeed learn to understand the language, since they are not productively using it, and frequently, there&#39;s no possibility of becoming native-like."

jr_hK2Owq8o,Thanks for the feedback! This was the first video I ever made so it&#39;s probably understandable why it sounds like I&#39;m uninterested. I assure you that is not the case!
jr_hK2Owq8o,"This is a functional view of language acquisition, so is not to do with the LAD really. Functionalists state that children learn language because they realise it performs a communicative function. Chomsky is a nativist/generativist so believes that children learn language because it is innate in them to do so and it has nothing to do with the function of language. (Obviously these are the extreme views - there are some theorists who propose that certain elements of learning generally are innate, not language learning, and many more theories)"

esPRsT-lmw8,Maybe you are just a Stephen King clone. Not a joke. I&#39;m a pro fiction writer &amp; this describes my behavior too. Though I should also add that I imagine lots of other scenarios.
esPRsT-lmw8,@Laer Carroll Could be no better than phrenology.  Do you think you could improve phrenology?  I&#39;m not a doctor but I liked this video and researched it further but was disappointed by what I found.  I was also disappointed by Amen.
esPRsT-lmw8,"Maybe true. BUT this should cause us to improve this technique, not to totally ignore it. Psychiatrists have a vested interest in using behavioral cures for behavioral problems &amp; their conclusions should be looked at closely."
esPRsT-lmw8,"I was obsessed with getting one too! So many years of torment. Until I can afford it I started neurofeedback therapy. There’s also some Ted talks about it. Biofeedback/neurofeedback, Some insurances cover it. The place I go takes payments thank god"

esPRsT-lmw8,I have no medical evidence but from my experience the major negatice effect of video game addiction a d drug abbuse is our mental stability. It will not only degrade your personality but also psychologically affect your wellbeing. My video game addiction had the worst out of me by making me think about games all day long and extremely stressful  as each game I loose will make me rage. I have been free from video games for almost 6 months and I can already  see my life a lot better. I will definitely  recommend  you to curb one&#39;s addiction
esPRsT-lmw8,I wanted to add a bravo - this is a great Tedx Talk and a great area that I plan to learn more about. Thank you!
esPRsT-lmw8,Could not be said any better. What a teachable moment for the human race. The state of the world is a result of human behavior and being that the brain is the organ of behavior it would make sense if make the human brain healthier you change the world for the better.
esPRsT-lmw8,"Yup, unfortunately he didn&#39;t give any  examples of treatment"
esPRsT-lmw8,"@That Random YouTube Channel No I get that, I&#39;m saying what&#39;s the problem with his research?  Like why is there such a negative reaction to something that seems so great?  Why are people against the concept that healthy brains male healthy people?  That seems intuitive to me already.  I don&#39;t understand why people would be against"
esPRsT-lmw8,@J.C. Dickson the big deal about the talk is he&#39;s been able to correlate brain scan images with symptoms of mental illness. The scans hadn&#39;t been used in that way before. This means possible early detection of what could be in some cases severe mental illness. This could possibly prevent tragedies like mass shootings for instance.  Not only does it potentially save the lives of would be victims but it stops the mentally ill person from committing criminal acts and greatly improves the quality of their life as well. This can stop so many negative outcomes in so many lives.
esPRsT-lmw8,I agree.  I was entranced by his speech and he seemed to get pretty emotional there a couple of times and it all seemed quite sincere to me.  I&#39;m not sure what the kerfuffle is over his talk is.  But there seems to be one.
esPRsT-lmw8,"Thank you for your comment. I feel similarly. I have mental health professionals tell me I&#39;m doing great which is validating, but also not helping me solve any of my issues."
esPRsT-lmw8,@J.C. Dickson its truly medicine. Instead of blocking emotions it lets you safely explore them at your own pace amd calms the mind enough so you can actually think. Calms the body from anger and anxiety when it pops up and let&#39;s you breathe for a min. Its 1000% better than chemicals.. This helps me function and actually get out of bed everyday..
esPRsT-lmw8,@Krystal Francis I&#39;ve heard that from a lot of patients and friends and colleagues.  Without the cannabis they are far worse off.

esPRsT-lmw8,"Hi Lauren Danielle, I would recommend getting a second opinion from another neurologist/neuro-surgeon.  Depending on the type of cyst, it may not be warranted to remove it as any intervention in an organ as critical as the brain does carry some risk(s).  Some cysts are &quot;incidental findings&quot; i.e. found by coincidence when you were scanned for evaluation of your concussion and are otherwise asymptomatic.  It may be a better/safer course to follow your cyst with periodic conventional scans (MRIs/CTs).  I do not think that a SPECT scan would be of any help in your case.  Most doctors are true professionals, I would trust them.  Dr. Amen&#39;s program is a business, sadly enough with poorly scientifically-proven food supplement product sales.  I am sure that your specialist would tell you whether you would benefit from a SPECT scan.  Peace be with you, Ciao, L"

SSRIs (antidepressants) are generally effective for 50% remission rate in one out of every 6 or 7 people they are given to. Just under half of those taking SSRIs will be in remission after 6 months. Psychotherapy is on the whole effective for one out of three and has better relapse prevention, but some therapies are even more effective than that (e.g. EMDR for trauma). <br><br>What about other conditions? Psychotherapy for panic disorder is shown across studies to be more effective than antidepressants or benzodiazepines. Yet if you go to a psychiatrist or an emergency department complaining of panic, you&#39;ll be offered medication as the first option."

esPRsT-lmw8,@Mark Terzano so sorry to read this but if you know that the frontal lobe shapes our personality and decision making so probably the tumor and the surgery caused involuntary personality change. This might clear up your head on her sudden unexpected change. <br>Sometimes there is no one to blame! it is just life.. to be grateful for what you have and move on might be the right answer.
esPRsT-lmw8,"My first wife at 24 y/o had a frontal tumor removed 3 years into our marriage. It was a level 3 astrocytoma, she really did well no problems, she worked, drove, functioned normally all she wanted was a divorce after being by her side for her for 7 more years. I gave it to her. My family was hurt as they where with us the whole time and her family did not care. That was in 1991 also. After the divorce in 1998 I had not heard from her since, I don&#39;t know if she is alive or not. Very hurt indeed."
esPRsT-lmw8,"I knew a woman who had had a tumor removed from her right frontal lobe decades before. She couldn&#39;t track time or use good judgement, because of the damage done not only by the tumor but the surgery (they weren&#39;t very good at brain surgery back then)."

esPRsT-lmw8,"ok, can someone help me decipher those comments? 😅"
esPRsT-lmw8,"@za zu <br>FYI<br>NEUROLOGY IN CLINICAL PRACTICE<br>Single-Photon Emission Computed Tomography <br>The first SPECT measurements were performed in the 1960s (Kuhl and Edwards, 1964). SPECT employs gamma-emitting radionuclides that decay by emitting a single gamma ray. Typical radionuclides employed for neurological SPECT are technetium-99m (99mTc; half-life = 6.02 hours) and iodine-123 (123I; half-life = 13.2 hours). Gamma cameras are used for SPECT acquisition, whereby usually two or three detector heads rotate around the patient&#39;s head to acquire two-dimensional planar images (projections) of the head from multiple angles (e.g., in 3-degree steps). Whereas radiation collimation is achieved by coincidence detection in PET, hardware collimators with lead septa are placed in front of the detector heads in the case of SPECT scanners. Finally, 3D image data reconstruction is done by conventional reconstruction algorithms. With combined SPECT/CT systems, a CT transmission scan can replace less accurate calculated attenuation correction. The different acquisition principles imply that SPECT possesses a considerably lower sensitivity than PET. Thus, rapid temporal sampling (image frames of seconds to minutes) as a prerequisite for pharmacokinetic analyses is the strength of PET, whereas a single SPECT acquisition usually takes 20 to 30 minutes. Furthermore, the spatial resolution of modern SPECT is only about 7 to 10 mm, deteriorating with increasing distance between object and collimator (i.e., higher resolution for cortical than subcortical structures; distance between patient and collimator should be minimized for optimal resolution). Thus, SPECT is more susceptible to partial volume effects than PET, which can be a particular drawback when it comes to imaging small structures or lesions (e.g., brain tumors). Nevertheless, brain-dedicated SPECT instruments that allow for optimized spatial and temporal sampling and pharmacokinetic data quantification have been proposed (Meyer et al., 2008), and further technical developments are underway (Jansen and Vanderheyden, 2007). The important advantages of SPECT over PET are the lower costs and broad availability of SPECT systems and radionuclides. While 123I-labeled tracers (e.g., [123I]FP-CIT ([123I]ioflupane, DaTSCAN) for dopamine transporter (DAT) imaging) can easily be shipped over long distances, technetium-99m can be eluted onsite from molybdenum-99 (99Mo)/99mTc generators and used for labeling commercially available radiopharmaceutical kits. We will focus on the two most widely used CBF tracers, hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime ([99mTc]HMPAO) and ethylcysteinate dimer ([99mTc]ECD). Owing to their lipophilic nature and thus high first-pass extraction, both radiotracers are rapidly taken up by the brain. They are quasi-irreversibly retained after conversion into hydrophilic compounds (enzymatic de-esterification of [99mTc]ECD; instability, and possibly interaction with glutathione in the case of [99mTc]HMPAO). Differences in uptake mechanisms may explain slight differences in biological behavior (e.g., in stroke), with [99mTc]HMPAO being more closely correlated to perfusion, while [99mTc]ECD uptake is also influenced by metabolic activity. Despite the fact that cerebral radiotracer uptake is virtually complete within just 1 to 2 minutes after injection, SPECT acquisition is usually started after 30 to 60 minutes to allow for sufficient background clearance. Given the fact that the CBF is closely coupled to cerebral glucose metabolism, and thus to neuronal function (with a few rare exceptions), [99mTc]HMPAO and [99mTc]ECD are used to assess neuronal activity. However, since cerebral autoregulation is also affected by many other factors (e.g., carbon dioxide level) and possibly diseases, cerebral glucose metabolism represents a more direct and probably less variable marker of neuronal activity. Given the technical limitations mentioned earlier, [18F]FDG PET is generally preferred to CBF SPECT. One important exception, however, is the use of ictal CBF SPECT in the assessment of patients with epilepsy. [123I]FP-CIT SPECT scans for assessment of nigrostriatal integrity in suspected parkinsonism or dementia with Lewy bodies are typically acquired 3 hours after tracer injection and evaluated by visual inspection and semi-quantitative region-of-interest analyses as outlined by the respective practice guidelines (Djang et al., 2012)."
esPRsT-lmw8,"@za zu <br>Ictal SPECT can be useful in some conditions like refractory epilepsy, otherwise, FDG-PET has largely supplanted SPECT. Nevertheless, the problem is not a SPECT problem but the doctor’s inappropriate use of a research tool and confirmatory test.

I was recommended a regimen of supplements, such as 5-HTP, GABA, and L-Theanine. The first time I took those supplements, within an hour I felt incredibly calm. I had never felt like that before. My brain was actually quiet. I could sleep. I wasn&#39;t driving like an insane person. <br><br>The 5-HTP eventually stopped proving helpful and actually made me feel worse. I chalk this up to my brain having &quot;filled up&quot; on it and now I was overdosing. The GABA eventually stopped improving my mood as much as it had in the past.  Perhaps for the same &quot;all filled up&quot; reason. The L-Theanine continues to work effectively at quieting my mind and calming strong emotions. I take 200mg at night to quell racing thoughts and help me fall asleep, and 50mg during the day as needed to calm anxiety and that feeling of rising irrational emotions. <br><br>The supplement regimen didn&#39;t cure my depression or bulimia, but it was effective at helping manage my anxiety and anger.

esPRsT-lmw8,@Christina LW28 right. When someone says me and my colleagues it always sounds wrong to me.
esPRsT-lmw8,"And he’s community and generationally minded. These types of people a few a dozen, if even that these days."
esPRsT-lmw8,“ my colleagues and I did this.” Is correct.

esPRsT-lmw8,Not really
esPRsT-lmw8,"It&#39;s all about the money. Of course pharmaceutical trusts would never allow the development of something, that would reduce the use of their products. Nobody really cares about people."

esPRsT-lmw8,"If you understood the impact of what he was saying, you’d be as passionate as well"
esPRsT-lmw8,"@Kat James medical doesn’t help figure that out I’ve done it and still don’t know.  This guy could give at least one example of treatment he changed based on the brain scans that he wouldn’t have otherwise done, but he didn’t.  Most of his rehab solutions are things like meditation which people already do and barely helps anyone."
esPRsT-lmw8,"also the abstract for the study he mentions at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esPRsT-lmw8&amp;t=11m18s"">11:18</a> is available online.<br><br>he mostly used supplements. the treatment protocol was weight loss, fish oil, multi vitamins, ginkgo, vinpocetine, acetyl l carnitine, huperzine A, alpha lipoic acid and NAC."
esPRsT-lmw8,the football player Joe Namath said brain scans showed he had TBI from playing football. he did about 120 hyperbaric oxygen therapy sessions over six months and it reversed the brain damage when he had updated brain scans.
esPRsT-lmw8,@Chip Kyle subconscious rewiring. change your reality by changing your mindset
esPRsT-lmw8,"You need to read his books,  and probably go to medical school. it’s not something that can be covered in a 15 minute video. Maybe he will develop a video series to train therapists how to interpret scans and design a rehabilitation program for each individual."
esPRsT-lmw8,Behavior that is rewarded occurs more frequently.  They are rewarded for throwing pills at people not for patient outcome.
esPRsT-lmw8,"True, but most people can&#39;t even afford to go to the psychiatrist or to therapy. Sometimes people can only afford there one size fits all pill mill and the chance that prozac at $4 a month may work is worth taking for them. Requiring or only treating based on brain scans would just create more of a barrier to psychiatric care. I don&#39;t necessarily think it&#39;s on psychiatrists, but on our health care system as a whole."
esPRsT-lmw8,@Aysha Kimble The US has a violent culture at home and abroad. Private US citizens own almost half the privately owned firearms in the world. That doesn&#39;t happen in a vacuum or without a felt need to defend against members of the community and their guard dogs who get off the leash.
esPRsT-lmw8,@Arthur Ashy that was not my point. My point was that psychiatrists are not the experts on the field the ted talk is held about. So I was not speaking well about psychiatrists
esPRsT-lmw8,Psychiatrists are NOT Neurologists. Psychiatrists are medical doctors prescribing medication and therapy! Please don&#39;t mix up the two the ones that specialize in research on the brain are Neuroscientists for mental health especially Neuropsychologists. Doctors are professionals at &quot;treatment&quot; so for instance if a patient has a brain tumor the doctor (in that case brainsurgeon) would operate and remove the tumor and the Neuropsychologists would perform tests with the patient to check if all the cognitive functions are still in tact. Doctor&#39;s are no research professionals they often do not practice the newest technologies they practice what they learned.
esPRsT-lmw8,"@Lisa Cresswell  Biofeedback and neurofeedback are modalities regularly employed in the practice of psychiatric care.  But Dr Amen is not using SPECT imaging in the use of these therapies.  What I mean is that the patient isn&#39;t in the scanner and working with these modalities while the scan is giving feedback.  That isn&#39;t what he is talking about.  That type of therapy has been used in research with fMRI and in practice using something like EEG but not SPECT imaging.  Again, these therapies are available without the expense of the SPECT scan"
esPRsT-lmw8,I think he&#39;s referring to biofeedback and neurofeedback. It does work and it&#39;s not psychiatry. It targets the areas of the brain that have the wrong levels of electrical activity to either reduce or increase.

esPRsT-lmw8,"You should read his books but in short hand you can reverse damage by one, eating a healthy organic diet, cut back on carbs and sugars. No alcohol or drugs. Supplementation. Exercises is huge. Meditation and sleeping good. There’s a lot of things but it really comes down to just taking care of yourself and it’s especially important as to what u put into ur body."

esPRsT-lmw8,I love Dr. Amen. His philosophy is so duh yet so foreign. It makes you wonder how Psychiatrists sleep at night...
esPRsT-lmw8,"Yes ! Treatment should be all encompassing for a precise mental health diagnosis:  PET scan,  therapy, possible psychoptropic medication (only when applicable),  exercise, nutrition plan, and monitoring other lifestyle/environmental aspects !"

If we have to level the playing field, I prefer a high altitude if you don’t mind."
esPRsT-lmw8,@Poetsrear It`s because IT WOULD BE CONTROLED. Freedom of choice is everything. You just said that in your previous comment. Individualism. Let the individual be and make his own choice. You can still have groups. Connect with a group if you wish. a Good group. indulging all other groups. Moving freely between them as you wish. For example people do this in sport. Large groups support a sport together. Yet they all have other interests too. People want freedom. And not to be put into clusters of identifications. There is nothing individual about that. Would you be happy if the state enforces you to whatch football? No. Why then cluser people. The though process of the world currently seems to me to take away individuality and group identify you. So my good friend Dwayne was just saying this can be used as a tool to accomplish just that.

esPRsT-lmw8,"@psynurse I guess it won&#39;t go in their interest if patients get brain scanned and get diagnosed, treated and healed as a result.<br>    They&#39;d be more happy if a patient keeps doing to psychiatrist his whole life, and pops pills and suffers sideeffects of the pills and gets more sick etc etc..."
esPRsT-lmw8,Yes I totally agree I&#39;ve worked psych all over the United States and I&#39;ve only had but a few very few that had had brain imaging like this. CT scans yes but not this. And then when I pushed to get it authorized from insurance companies they don&#39;t want to authorize it. So yes it is strange that after all this time it&#39;s still not being utilized like it probably should be

esPRsT-lmw8,Good morning and happy are you today ?
esPRsT-lmw8,Hello my friend
esPRsT-lmw8,But what was the solution?
esPRsT-lmw8,He used SPECT scans.
esPRsT-lmw8,"There is no software when it comes to the human brain. Our thought is a physical process that takes place in our brains. And to change our thought patterns is to physically change our minds and bodies.<br><br>Yes we should address literal brain damage. But also, to approach things from a cognitive behavioral therapy approach, a meditative approach and coaching approach is still very useful and appropriate. To change thought I’d a form of physics change within the mind"
esPRsT-lmw8,Soft ware is our original intelligence.
esPRsT-lmw8,"It does help you may have the TBI an no one get you the soft ware to use to Rebuild what you have left of a  life,when its failure it&#39;s when your .neglect to have a chance to not be dependent on another .2 to feel like one has the ability. if the private heath insurance that was paid for me would have got a new chance to a new life .an I met even babe chosen better people to be in my life.,And my children might have got to have a chance to have there real mother.not that he loved of off an collected life insurance on me took my BANK accout. Oh by the way,I had a order off protection. From a county judge.that reversed it because I was in a coma from him.a  the cop sn judges an police were corrupt. Thanks that software would have been part of medical treatment that the so called specialist should have known there fefield of mrdicine better."
esPRsT-lmw8,And everybody knows and keeps tredding the tredmill. Indoctrinated by the system.
esPRsT-lmw8,"@ملك I like your reply. But I meant how does the physical tissue or cells in the brain repair themselves or as a whole ,on a molecular scale .like maybe fish oil I&#39;ve heard helps but how does that work ? Idk my mind wonders."
esPRsT-lmw8,Get enough sleep <br><br>Excercise<br><br>Have good communication skills <br><br>Take care and love <br><br>Build up healthy relationships in your family that may help you be better you<br><br>And at the end try contacting a psychiatrist and reporting your problem clearly to them if possible<br><br>Hope this helps
esPRsT-lmw8,This person is probably very busy idk you should try contacting your nearest hospital for an appointment with such a medical situation if it&#39;s possible
esPRsT-lmw8,Thank you !!!!

Combined with the mind boggling simplicity of how these issues in the field still go completely disregarded in every day psychiatry, this is powerful stuff. I guess you need to have a certified brain injury in order to get a brain scan. 20 years of major depression and variety of other disorders does not qualify."
esPRsT-lmw8,"@Geoffrey Harris yes, sir"
esPRsT-lmw8,"Way too simplistic, not remotely close to considering the endless amount of potential mediators to successful treatment."

esPRsT-lmw8,@Epsie Shapley What’s the name of the clinic please?
esPRsT-lmw8,What was the treatment?
esPRsT-lmw8,"@Shaun Dionne He&#39;s got a point..   I&#39;d love to see a creative interpretation, from an inspired artist of a representation of &quot;The Mind&#39;s Eye Inverted, so all may observe externally from the inside looking out&quot;"
esPRsT-lmw8,lol
esPRsT-lmw8,"But what about so-called successful people who are not quite brain healthy, like sociopaths?"
esPRsT-lmw8,He’s harming me by telling me about these test that I can never ever afford.......and insurance doesn’t cover

esPRsT-lmw8,"​@Mike Detrick In countries that have normal health care, such as my country Croatia, you go to your doctor and ask for a scan referral and get it. The doctor himself directed you to additional tests to cover everything, you have been waiting for some tests for a couple of months. You don’t have to take out a bank loan or go bankrupt to do checkups and get treated.<br>Healing is a legacy of civilization, not a business. As well as education."

esPRsT-lmw8,5 Grand is a steal!  There is so much included in that cost.
esPRsT-lmw8,"Reading some of the comments, there is a reason that people leave countries like Great Britain, Canada and others to seek treatment in the USA.  They would not be leaving those countries to seek medical help in America is socialized medicine was a good thing.   Otherwise what this guy said made sense to me"
esPRsT-lmw8,"That’s the problem w/ modern medicine. I read a book called Cultural Diversity in Health &amp; Illness for college &amp; one of the chapters covered the “white coat culture” that we know so well in the States. Hospital systems are confusing, the bills are overwhelming, modern equipment is so pricey your jaw would drop if you knew how much it cost, etc. In actuality, you’d probably be better off seeing a witch doctor than an actual one especially if you aren’t loaded w/ cash. Our system is flawed &amp; sometimes they still fail to diagnose the problem correctly as is the case w/ my mother. They think her affliction is rare &amp; possibly unheard of but after countless tests &amp; what not &amp; a mountain of hospital bills later, they chalked it up to asthma because her specialists couldn’t agree w/ each other &amp; kept arguing back &amp; forth. It’s not like the show House was- it’s a lot more complicated &amp; bureaucratic than that"
esPRsT-lmw8,"@Clinton Ortiz dude.... How is that even related to genetics?.... What he says rings true with my own personal life.... I actually believe that such previously undetected problems was the main cause for the decay of my family: my great-grandfather ended his life after he went bankrupt due to company nationalization, my uncle had mental problems that became worse when he took the wrong medication, my grandma had Alzheimer&#39;s, my grandpa had lung cancer due to massive amounts of cigarettes on a daily basis and we know that addiction results from such unresolved issues"
esPRsT-lmw8,"Societal rot in America really starts with its wars. Soldiers driven mad by war go home to their families as alcoholics and addicts and thus begins the cycle of dysfunction, traumatized kids, and intergenerational trauma. Stop being such a bully country and maybe your society would stop being the madhouse it is today."

esPRsT-lmw8,"This gentleman is a wonderful orrator and a very influential person. His credentials He doesn’t even tell you at school of medicine he goes to or went to. He doesn’t tell you who he worked for or studied under he doesn’t tell you about any empirical data but he does tell you the psychiatrist are the only people that cannot directly study their organ system.<br><br>What a master at manipulation and excellent abuse of his professional degree FMD<br>However he talks about the SPECT scan.  I am a clinician that has dealt with the neurological sciences from the atomic to social and behavioral neurological information. We don’t have proof we have people that say oh I’ve seen...<br><br>SPECT scan can really not be measured or understood because our brains are different. Now how do you know that what he says is true? How do you know that that Alzheimer’s patient didn’t have a head injury or a stroke or even an addiction? How do you know what those colors mean and with those areas of the brain R and with those areas of the brain do. What does this measure? Blood flow heat? They cannot measure behavior. There are so many things such as neurotransmitters, genetic factors, environmental factors, the access to healthcare the part of the process of the injury or disease process whether it is getting worse or better. There is no comparison study there is no explanation of what those colors and regions are. <br><br>If you go to a doctor you expect the coverage to come from either your own insurance company or Medicaid or sometimes unfortunately people are always a self pay patient because they do not have access to healthcare benefits and they don’t qualify for assistance. But every single one of Dr. Ayman’s patients - every person treated Is this self pay patient. He prescribes herbal concoctions that he charges exorbitant amounts I have money and they are not covered because they are not considered or tested for the efficacy that he claims. He also owns the hyperbaric oxygenation chambers that he often prescribes multiple treatments for his patients. He owns the equipment, he determines how much she’s going to charge for each and every treatment and how many treatments that you’re going to have. People are so desperate and so impressionable that they believe him and they see a change. His treatment plans are not considered medically necessary. This is because he has not embraced the field of psychology. I have yet to see a peer reviewed double blind study that shows that his treatment is of benefit and no harm to a patient. He has self proclaimed his treatment without any quantifiable studies or reliable or credible Papers etc. no insurance company will even look at a bill and Medicare everybody just kicks out his charges he doesn’t even know he just feels the patient. He is the most unethical doctor with one exception in my career."

esPRsT-lmw8,"@orchardlea my diagnosis is generalized anxiety, EDnos and OCD"
esPRsT-lmw8,Have you been to see a doctor about ADHD? Those are all common symptoms.
esPRsT-lmw8,I pray you find some real treatment.  How can you get information about this brain therapy of which Dr. Amen speaks?
esPRsT-lmw8,"@Lordoa Thanks for the feedback :D. I am still a bit offended by it however, as it is similar to the difference between &quot;people with mental illness&quot; and &quot;mentally ill people,&quot; or just &quot;the mentally ill.&quot; It&#39;s the difference between &quot;your brain has a problem(to be treated)&quot; and &quot;your brain is a problem(to be fixed).&quot; <br>I also agree with you that, in general, judging strangers is inadvisable, but considering that Dr. Daniel Amen is a millionaire whom the scientific community widely regards as preaching a lie, it can be important to have a healthy level of skepticism.<br>(And the psychology of internet comments <b>is</b> fascinating.)"
esPRsT-lmw8,"It implies that the brains do not function normally.  They are not broken, they are just not healthy. It doesn&#39;t mean that they are incapable or the like. <br>No need to have such a grim outlook. People hardly judge others. Just like you don&#39;t judge the strangers you meet in real life. :D<br><br>But with other wording he could have said, &quot;repair?, treat?&quot;. It&#39;s all the same in the end. Without acknowledging that such disorders are problems, not normal, that occur in the brain, they can&#39;t be fixed either.<br><br>That aside, the psychology of internet comments is interesting. Depending on the tone you read it in, your mood fluctuates. Smiley faces :D and the like help achieve a &quot;good, calm&quot; tone. Also wording plays a great part in how your comment is perceived. That is basic even in real life, but with no others things to read it will have a greater impact.<br><br>If I started with: &quot;No, It implies that the brains do not function normally&quot;, you would read it with an angrier tone. Smiley faces give much needed information for the brain and overall help others perceive your comment positively. :D<br>A great way to spread positivity."

esPRsT-lmw8,"@steve jette Hard to accomplish not only for prisoners, but also for working-class people who spend most of their lives in the office where all nutrition they can get is from the coffee machine, and whose only exercise is running to catch the bus, and whose only positive thoughts are about getting home sleeping a few hours before the alarm clock wakes them up at 5 a.m. again."
esPRsT-lmw8,"@steve jette thanks, Steve. I think we all already know those things help. We don&#39;t need to be a doctor to figure that out. Lol 😂"
esPRsT-lmw8,"@W. D. Abegaz It&#39;s in his books.  Pretty logical. Nutrition, exercise and blood flow, breathing, positive thoughts and input, etc"
esPRsT-lmw8,Raised a Catholic thanks - this is not helpful
esPRsT-lmw8,"@Ryan I don&#39;t see that he necessarily shows that it &quot;works&quot; particularly well - at least not in all circumstances..... Rather that he&#39;s demonstrating that a tool that can be extremely helpful in some circumstances isn&#39;t being used. If some one has a tumour or cyst causing angry outbursts, obviously no amount of CBT is going to cure the behaviour.... if someone has a severe recurrent depression, understanding what the brain is doing could be useful -  However if someone has a mild-moderate depression - 70% of people recover within 6 months regardless of whether they receive treatment or not - so spending £000&#39;s on a scan to see what is going on isn&#39;t really a good use of resources. (I&#39;m not saying we shouldn&#39;t treat the first instance of mild-moderate depression - 30% don&#39;t get better without treatment)<br><br>Spect is a tool, that could be useful in certain circumstances - however it&#39;s also costly. And not without danger - it involves injecting radioactive isotopes into the body, and watching them travel round the brain. I don&#39;t think it should be rolled out to every person who might seek psychiatric help - but it should be considered as a useful tool in circumstances where it currently is not."
esPRsT-lmw8,"If it works as well as he is showing it does, he deserves to earn some dough. A lot of it."
esPRsT-lmw8,"It&#39;s not common practice because it&#39;s expensive - and because drug companies can make far more from medicating someone to suppress the symptoms, than they can from treating the root cause.<br><br>As for what brain rehabilitation is - it depends on the treatment plan. Sometimes it is along the lines of more traditional psychological therapies - DBT, CBT, mindfulness, etc. Sometimes it&#39;s more physiological - general physical exercise regimes, physio therapy, speech therapy, relearning every day tasks. Sometimes it&#39;s a mixture of both physiological and psychological activities.<br><br>A friend was in a car crash and lost the ability to walk, but also to moderate her mood. Her behaviour &#39;deteriorated&#39; in the months following the crash while her physical injuries improved. Once she was physically able to begin re-learning how to walk, her mood also began improving, and her behaviour improved again. This is an extreme case. However another friend anecdotally reported that the dementia care home she works in saw a reduction in aggressive behaviour when they had a new house nurse start - she was very keen on encouraging those who were able to do more for themselves. It meant that everything took longer for a while, but (again, anecdotally) giving the individuals back a degree of control over their own lives improved their well-being, and their behaviour. Simple things, like teaching one woman who&#39;s multiple strokes had affected her right side that she could do things left handed (brush her teeth, draw).<br>Working in a post hospital rehab unit I saw the transformation of one woman following a Stoke - came in very withdrawn, with angry outbursts. She had expressive aphasia - once the slt&#39;s had seen her and suggested trying to sing what she wanted to say, rather than trying to speak it, she became a bright bubbly affectionate lady, and there was still frustration at times, but no more dinner trays thrown across the room at staff!<br><br>The mood/behavioural issues seen in obvious brain injury are treated as a symptom of the functional brain problem.... But the mood/behavioural issues seen in &#39;mental health&#39; conditions are viewed as the problem itself. Sometimes, this may be true - but I&#39;d suspect that often there&#39;s an underlying cause.<br><br>(Hence why gold standard first line treatment for mild-moderate depression is omega 3 and exercise... Improving the structure and blood flow of the brain.)"
esPRsT-lmw8,"@Rose Ringer Wow, you&#39;ve really been through some hard times, Rose. I wish you love and luck with your recovery x"
esPRsT-lmw8,"Thanks, Joe. I&#39;m glad to see your comment. My husband ended his life at our home, and I am so weary of people telling me that I just need to &quot;think better,&quot; and &quot;put it out of my mind.&quot; Four years out, subsequent to a heart attack and NDE, I&#39;m doing so much better, but these &quot;experts&quot; who tell us that self-improvement is all in the head just WEAR ME OUT."
esPRsT-lmw8,"@danguee1 That&#39;s exactly what is being accomplished with the comment. Saying that they didn&#39;t like what they found IS teaching them to fish, because if they don&#39;t want to take things someone is saying as fact then they themselves will look further into it. If the comment said what wasn&#39;t liked, then that is again just telling people what to think."
esPRsT-lmw8,@danguee1 maybe I was was being too subtle: I was suggesting that people should check before believing him just because he talks well.
esPRsT-lmw8,"Ok, except: Why come onto a site and tell the readers of comment you don&#39;t like this. They don&#39;t know you and never will. So there&#39;s no benefit to such an action other than to make yourself feel better, more &#39;investigative&#39; - because it sure don&#39;t benefit the people reading this comment. Why not say why you don&#39;t like this. Maybe put in a link to a respectable article. Two bits of something of actual value. OR you could do something even more valuable: tell people to remember not to just absorb stuff that TEDS presenters spout - but to ALWAYS remember the verify the origins of what they&#39;re taking in. Give a person a fish to and you&#39;ll feed them for a day. Teach them how to fish and you&#39;ll feed them for life...."

esPRsT-lmw8,That&#39;d be awesome!
esPRsT-lmw8,"@Superboy_cool it&#39;s okay, I can just make it a quick view without references, thx"
esPRsT-lmw8,"@Cosmos Woo Unfortunately, I don’t really have anything for you. My conclusion is largely based on the fact that references are largely absent. I couldn’t find any papers that back up his claims decisively. I checked his website, googled a couple SPECT-related search terms and his name and didn’t turn up any good evidence. Rather, it mostly seems that his contemporaries think the risk outweighs the benefit. (There has to be pretty substantial benefit to justify irradiating a person’s head) also, I did all this months ago, so anything I found then may not even exist anymore, or could be outdated, in which case, let me know. I’m pretty sure I saw something along the lines of “his clinic’s results were not statistically significantly improved over a general psychiatric’s” but again, I don’t know where and I could be slightly misremembering. Sorry I can’t be more helpful."
esPRsT-lmw8,"can you show some reference? i need to do a presentation on this, and i want to introduce your idea:)"
esPRsT-lmw8,"@Superboy_cool what I appreciate about your comments is your reasonable approach - you&#39;re not drinking the cool aid. Lol Peer review isn&#39;t the end all be all, but it does bring an incredible amount of credibility. And this guy lacks it. As inspirational as this video may be,  it lacks concrete solutions other than get a brain scan. Plus, based on the limited research ppl have mentioned about him so far, he himself may not necessarily hold the answers either. But i think ppl want to believe he does, and thus comments such as yours may be hard to swallow for some people."
esPRsT-lmw8,"But if I was the one in five (20 percent) he helped, I&#39;d be totally grateful!  Tell me the statistics of the psychologists who don&#39;t use brain scans.  What are their statistics using only pharmaceutical drugs?  That is the bigger question, don&#39;t you think?"
esPRsT-lmw8,"@SciFiGirl007 Surgeons do take time looking at the reports, diagnosing, discussing options with their colleagues, and the patient, during which time they may consult people from other discipline. Never meant during the surgery, which you seem to understand."
esPRsT-lmw8,Add psychiatric nurse practitioners
esPRsT-lmw8,Clearly your not in health care.... Surgeons working alongside other professionals?  Herding Cats
esPRsT-lmw8,That&#39;s absolutely correct sir.
esPRsT-lmw8,"As you point out about brain scans, they are not the answer to every situation.  That doesn&#39;t mean that brain scans aren&#39;t are a useful tool and with time, can become a much better tool.  This is the same scientific method used to develop Adderall which you say is helping you.  Good for you though it doesn&#39;t have the same impact on everyone.  It&#39;s better to have more tools though not every tool is helpful in every situation.  Carpenters and mechanics have many specialized tools and still new tools are being researched and tested."
esPRsT-lmw8,Made me chuckle
esPRsT-lmw8,Of course they will attack him. He is discrediting the entire profession! And his way is the correct way or at least better than what they&#39;re doing. Dr. Amen&#39;s therapies actually work. I am living proof and thousands of others are too.
esPRsT-lmw8,@Tomie Hanby All logical people voted for Trump.
esPRsT-lmw8,Bet u voted for trump
esPRsT-lmw8,the actual question is how he came up with this ridiculous name for it
esPRsT-lmw8,"unfortunately, that&#39;s the catch, since this methods have not been accepted by the medical community, see wikipedia Daniel Adam and start from there."
esPRsT-lmw8,Good morning and happy are you now?
esPRsT-lmw8,this talk certainly ought to be supplemented with a second one that dives a bit deeper into the medical process.
esPRsT-lmw8,I don’t know you but I’m very very sorry to hear that.
esPRsT-lmw8,Wow! You&#39;ve compiled the opinions of &#39;most brain experts&#39; on this subject?
esPRsT-lmw8,"@William Zhang thank you. All of these YouTube Radiologist think you can scan anyone, at any time, for any reason.  And let&#39;s not forget, most commentors think the scan should be cheaper or even free.   So much for &quot;woke&quot;"
esPRsT-lmw8,@Huntstyle thank you. A voice of reason.  No one does a scan without an indication or reason.  People commenting think that Phillps or GE make the machines for free because they&#39;re nice.
esPRsT-lmw8,@voxie what school of medicine and radiology internship did you graduate from.  There is a fifetime max amount of radiation you can have.  How do you know you won&#39;t get cancer or something and need multiple scans for years?
esPRsT-lmw8,"@gerrapk because there needs to be data to support brain scans for what this guy&#39;s talking about.  Secondly, even if scan is done do we really have treatments that would change the outcomes?? Not sure we are there yet"
esPRsT-lmw8,"Why be exposed to radiation if there is no clinical need for the exam?  Secondly, even if scan showed something, would the treatment be any different or do we even have an effective ( early) treatment?  Thirdly, the insurance company is not going to pay for scans that are not clinically indicated.  This TED talk sounded good, but it&#39;s a small piece of the medical treatment/data driven best practice puzzle."
esPRsT-lmw8,"&quot;Been known for 50 years&quot;? Then why isn&#39;t it applied? The NFL injuries are not invented, they are statistical realities. Aged boxers used to be called, &quot;Punchy&quot; because their brains didn&#39;t work. How good is the protocol? We will find out. It is published in peer-reviewed journal."
esPRsT-lmw8,pumpupthevolume.<br>Great observation.
esPRsT-lmw8,"It&#39;s not a &quot;potion;&quot; it&#39;s an approach, and it is different for every patient."
esPRsT-lmw8,"look up LLLT, theres 4000 studies on it. its going to start a revolution. it treats ADD, depression, ptsd, anxiety etc and literally ton of other uses all throughout the body. search almost all common diseases or ailments and there is typically a study already done showing it has promise or has already treated the issue."
esPRsT-lmw8,"Since every case is different in some way(s) from all the other cases, there are categories. And there are different treatments for different types of case and severity of condition. This is only a 20 minute talk."
esPRsT-lmw8,BRAIN SMART PROGRAM
esPRsT-lmw8,"Ms Mrs Mr singh, other than surgery, the changes are brought about through brain chemistry. The last time I looked there were 27 brain &quot;drugs&quot; available(in the US). Try searching brain chemistry, or drugs to alter brain chemistry. Failing that try neurology drugs etc. This is a field that is still in transition, in recent years I&#39;ve seen better results from China than America. As for this speaker, he is  really terrible, he is on stage using &quot;positioning&quot; tricks to sell the audience, while excluding useful data. Good luck."
esPRsT-lmw8,"This is what they do. Everything is patented, then taxed."
esPRsT-lmw8,Don&#39;t go to him then..get a brain scan done somewhere else. What da heck?
esPRsT-lmw8,"JDM, search &quot;drugs to alter brain chemistry&quot;, or neurology drugs. There were 27 new drugs to alter brain chemistry, and my data isn&#39;t current. In medicine today the educated patient will get the better treatment."

esPRsT-lmw8,"Mr Tanner, I would agree, this guy is a con artist. He is using &quot;positioning&quot; to sell the audience(through facial expression, speed of delivery etc). I didn&#39;t know anyone in the medical &quot;profession&quot; could be this criminal, however I seem to learn something new everyday(good or bad)."
esPRsT-lmw8,"Now now, our caves have improved dramatically, and hey look we&#39;ve mostly stopped hitting women over the head with a club to get a date."
esPRsT-lmw8,"Yeah but I went to a neurologist once and asked about SPECT scans and he said they&#39;re basically useless for diagnosis because there are no clinical outcomes from reading one. If you look this guy up his work is considered pseudoscientific (and as other comments suggest, his practice may be a scam)."
esPRsT-lmw8,I do Understand... is Physical
esPRsT-lmw8,No it is Mental illness. Maybe I don’t understand what you mean
esPRsT-lmw8,I genuinely respect your comment so pardon my soul due to every being do make mistakes. It&#39;s okay to be wrong and learn from lessons. I am grateful for your kind enlightenment.
esPRsT-lmw8,"This statement can&#39;t be said like that. People have different believes, for example i can kill somebody, no regrets. A lot of people can&#39;t comprehend someone can murder another person coldblooded, you wave it off as a mistake, because thats your believe. But you don&#39;t know the background of my reasoning, every male in my family has been to war hundreds of times in their dreams, not because we enjoy it, but we are programmed to defend lives when needed. Been in fights myself a couple of times and i have no fear, because of this mechanism. In nature male animals fight and sometimes to death. What a mistake is for you, might not be a mistake in my eyes and vice versa.<br>To put it in context, when your child is in danger, you suddenly can understand a lot of people can kill other people. It might be a weird example, but this is one of the most abnormal and suddenly normal example in context i could give you."
esPRsT-lmw8,"@Katherine Paradis-Chateauneuf Absolutely.  The public, educational system is running down our children.  Administrators could care less.  They just want their federal funding.  Government funds go directly in their wallets, bypassing children, teachers, courses offered, safety."
esPRsT-lmw8,"Yes very scary indeed considering the amount of people here that haven&#39;t the slightiest need to ask the basic question of HOW. A whole talk about curing without mentionning any single way to acheive it, and it doesnt arise any doubt in those poeple mind! What we need to cure is the education system."
esPRsT-lmw8,"@Patricia Crowell Unlikely. If the US was going to make these things better, it would have at least matched up to what Sweden and some of those other countries do.<br><br>The US justice system is more oriented on punishments (as if, of sinners) than respecting human life and trying to understand how someone might have ended up in a bad place."
esPRsT-lmw8,I kept thinking of this throughout the entire video! Haha
esPRsT-lmw8,My dad dropped me out of my carseat and onto the curb the first time he took me home from the hospital :)

esPRsT-lmw8,For real. I just started the intake process for this clinic after years of trying medicines and I just now realized how many brain injuries I’ve given myself :O
esPRsT-lmw8,No lol it gives it the actual meaning 🤣
esPRsT-lmw8,"@G C , Apparently ALL the people you know on medicaid and welfare are recognized as a minority of some type.  The greatest majority of folks on medicaid and welfare are minorities. For some it is absolutely necessary and a social obligation. Many are just using the system."
esPRsT-lmw8,"Acacia, if you can get yourself recognized as a minority, all of your medical care then becomes free. Yeah, yeah, that&#39;s a terrible thing to say(type), however at this time, it happens to be true."
esPRsT-lmw8,"@A K never done once, but sometimes my thoughts got disrupted and kinda blackout for a short time."
esPRsT-lmw8,Do you know what your diagnosis is?
esPRsT-lmw8,@DeeP`-_PerspectivE Pretty sure being raised in the AA environment gives me optimal experience on the matter...
esPRsT-lmw8,@Ruby red Mountains How so? How would it cause PTSD? AA is not like real cults like Scientology...
esPRsT-lmw8,Good morning and happy are you today
esPRsT-lmw8,"Be careful if your in a 12 step program, they have several similarities to the occult, I was raised around the AA program and it caused severe ptsd later in life, this facebook support group helped me recover “deprogramming from AA or any 12 step program”"
esPRsT-lmw8,"Decisions, you chose to use it and chose to leave it. Very proud of you. Well done!"
esPRsT-lmw8,"Also worth pointing out that Dr. Amen is talking about SPECT imaging, not fMRI."
esPRsT-lmw8,"I&#39;m sure there are many contributing factors that&#39;s have to be evaluated, like ones homeostasis, and social circumstances relation to scans"
esPRsT-lmw8,"It&#39;s not that fMRI scans themselves have been debunked. Brain scans are obviously still useful (for spotting things like cysts, tumours, the signs of Alzheimer&#39;s etc, or for seeing which general parts of a brain &#39;light up&#39; when someone is asked to do a task). Earlier studies had suggested that <b>behaviour</b> could be &quot;predicted&quot; by looking at someone&#39;s scan, but it turns out that brains are a lot more complicated than that. The amount of blood flow varies from time to time, and that&#39;s why scans don&#39;t look &quot;exactly the same&quot; each time they are done."
esPRsT-lmw8,Im currently going through a Brain Smart Program and surprisingly its helping.
esPRsT-lmw8,Go take it
esPRsT-lmw8,It depends on the brain.
esPRsT-lmw8,Hes a liar
esPRsT-lmw8,"When you do physical exercise you are challenging the body. You improve agility, Strength, stamina and endurance. Likewise you can exercise the brain by performing mental exercise such as learning how to play an instrument or learning a new language or even playing a game that requires you to use strategies. Oh, and NFL football players are prone to brain damage because they smash heads a lot. If the brain is constantly being knocked about in its shell it is bound to show symptoms of damage in the long run, despite wearing an helmet."
esPRsT-lmw8,Good morning and happy are you today ?
esPRsT-lmw8,"thanks for sharing this and you can help a lot of people from spending money on fake treatments by spreading your story as much as possible. A little search on David Amin makes it apparent he&#39;s basically a quack with nothing backing up his claims or methods, it&#39;s all mostly pseudo-science. question is why you still believe in him and his scans to some degree despite having experienced this firsthand?"
esPRsT-lmw8,I&#39;m not one of those thumbing this video down but I was disappointed that he never talked about how he made brains be better. I assume his nephew had brain surgery but what about Nancy? How did they make her brain better? It is the obvious question that was not addressed and makes this video very disappointing.
esPRsT-lmw8,"It was the lazy clinicians who don&#39;t want to do brain scans, lol"
esPRsT-lmw8,"how else is society supposed to pay for the things we need? How do we pay for roads, military, fire, police, health care, social security, etc?"
esPRsT-lmw8,Read Toxic by Dr. Neil Nathan and Never Bet Against Occam by Dr. Lawrence Afrin and It&#39;s Mitochondria Not Hypochondria by Dr. Sarah Myhill. Check out presentations by Dr Cathcart and Dr. T C Theoharides.
esPRsT-lmw8,"That was something I thought missing from the talk. Although I accept it probably wasn&#39;t the aim. If we all knew more about the programmes then maybe there are things we feel able to include in our day to day life. Habits that help prevent potential issues as we age, or maybe even alleviate minor symptoms early, when first noticed."
esPRsT-lmw8,"@Łukasz Umiński Bredesen&#39;s work is interesting. It is based on fairly small case series at the moment, but that is not a criticism as it takes a while to build up to controlled studies, and ultimately RCTs. His approach has a lot of components, most of which target general health and well-being, and it is not clear as yet which are the important ones. He himself acknowledges larger studies are required to confirm/disconfirm the results.  His case studies also focus on individuals with SCI, MCI and mild AD. The video here claims to be able to reverse an advanced dementia (i.e. requiring nursing home care) with an &quot;intense brain rehabilitation programme&quot;: that is what I would like to see supporting evidence for."
esPRsT-lmw8,Just take a look at Dale Bredesen&#39;s work and published results of his program.
esPRsT-lmw8,That&#39;s because they just want money. Helping people is a side benefit for them. He didn&#39;t explain any of these &quot;intense brain rehabilitation&quot; programs. Or even just a few examples used in them.
esPRsT-lmw8,Huh?
esPRsT-lmw8,i&#39;ll scan it for you
esPRsT-lmw8,"@HOWARD BOYD I&#39;ve already had an mri when I got kicked in the jaw, then temple. Showed I had brain damage. That was in January 2016."
esPRsT-lmw8,"@Jacques LeFave The gatekeepers should have been awake. I&#39;m anti-censorship, in general, and there is always inherent bias when deciding what passes through the gate. but for something like TED, that presents itself as a credible (as defined by the  rules of science), he should not have made it through. If it was the Intergalactic Homeopathy Channel, then I wouldn&#39;t even bat an eyelid."
esPRsT-lmw8,"@Shaun Shelly It seems to me that the gatekeepers here should have been the funders. If the protocols were as sloppy as you said, who fell asleep at the wheel? Or did he just spend his own money?"
esPRsT-lmw8,"@Jacques LeFave Nobody is suggesting they &#39;forbid&#39; research or stop curious scientific endeavour. However, once something is disproven or is shown to be untrue, one cannot continue ad infinitum and call it research, scientific, or justified. Researchers do not charge the research subject US$3 500 to participate in the research - in fact, researchers usually pay the research subjects. 83 000 scans is a number way beyond what would be needed to prove or disprove the hypothesis. In a randomised control trial can a SPECT scan, when used as a stand-alone diagnostic tool, improve the odds on correctly diagnosing a psychiatric or psychological condition in an individual? The answer is no. But, at US$3 000 each, that adds up to US$ 249 000 000. That&#39;s a lot of money for a lot of nothing, and a lot of motivation to sell the snake oil. Read the Wikipedia page.  What I am actually saying, is question everything. Including smooth talkers who appear to care deeply about their patients. Be curious, but also know how to spot a scam."
esPRsT-lmw8,"@Shaun Shelly I don&#39;t think that &quot;forbidding&quot; scientific research has a very good historical record. I&#39;m not saying that he and people like him are above criticism, not at all. I think that you, for instance, have some valid ones, but I also think that the research possibilities of new scientific instruments should be fully explored. In his time, Galileo was heavily criticised for his use and theorizing from his observations based on a 36 power telescope, very crude by our standards, and to be sure, he made some real whopper mistakes, like his now laughable theory of ocean tides. Similarly, Leeuwenhoek had an avalanche of ridicule and abuse piled on him for discovering living, mobile microorganisms in a drop of water. Accepted wisdom usually has a lot of truth in it, and scientific discoveries are rarely perfect and without error. This is how scientific progress is made. I&#39;m sure that there is a lot of validity to your points, but rather than shut down the research, it should be perfected, improved, and advanced. Do researchers often puff up and exaggerate their research and it&#39;s importance? Sure. Sometimes it&#39;s egotism, sometimes fishing for research funding, usually both. People are human."
esPRsT-lmw8,Kokila this could be adhd attention deficit disorder
esPRsT-lmw8,"Any personal information could be used for monstrous purposes in the wrong hands. But having a right psychiatric treatment when diagnosed with Alzheimer&#39;s disease for instance, or any other health issues would be a huge step forward for humanity. A right treatment for the specific health issue is major not only for patients, but for everybody around patients. It does have huge positive impact on society."
esPRsT-lmw8,I&#39;m sure that there are those that want to get into mind control.😵
esPRsT-lmw8,"Spect scans seem to be readily available these days, in the 7 years since this video was made...."
esPRsT-lmw8,I am sincerely so sorry for your loss.
esPRsT-lmw8,Afonso Carvalho <br>FMRIs shouldn’t be that expensive. I was give a Sunday sermon “Imaging the 7 Deadly Sins.” The fun part was sharing with the audience that lust and [thinking something] virtuous imaged ‘the same’. It sounds good - I’m not the fMRI or whatever specialist to know that might actually be true.
esPRsT-lmw8,@Patricia Crowell Thank you so much
esPRsT-lmw8,I wish you great success because it could change the world one person at a time.  Psychology is an admirable profession to pursue.
esPRsT-lmw8,"@Afonso Carvalho I don&#39;t believe youtube let&#39;s people put links in the comments, but this is one title you can search because the reporter did some research that can lead you to some other reading you can do about him and his methods. Search &quot;Head Case: Why Has PBS Promoted Controversial Shrink Dr. Daniel Amen?&quot;"
esPRsT-lmw8,@Jay Breen Where did you get that info? His work seems pretty legit
esPRsT-lmw8,@Helen Vernon her name is Lindsay I should mention.
esPRsT-lmw8,"@Hamish W Great news, really happy to hear you know someone who got their dad on the trial. If it&#39;s possible to have the email address that would be brilliant, thanks.x"
esPRsT-lmw8,"@Helen Vernon no problem at all. Biogen is another company, they’re all racing to get their drug approved as all show promise. Cassava is the only one shown so far to actually reverse symptoms. I know someone who contacted them directly and got their dad on the trial. If you need the email address let me know and ill find out. Good luck!"
esPRsT-lmw8,"@Hamish W Thanks so much Hamish for taking the time to reply...will definitely look into it!<br>Anything that&#39;s showing a positive outcome has to be encouraging, right? Here&#39;s to a brighter future for all AD families. Best wishes.x"
esPRsT-lmw8,"@Helen Vernon hey Helen there are a number of biotech companies currently in final stages of testing drugs that for the first time have been shown to reverse AD. Cassava Sciences are enlisting patients for trials, also Eli Lilly have one too but the Cassava one has better results. Since nothing has worked so far, it’s amazing progress and I hope these can help your family. You could contact them to get your family on the trial and give it a try. Good luck"
esPRsT-lmw8,"@Bjarne Smith Yes he was on anti psychotic drugs, but his strength was mental.  He was truly insane."
esPRsT-lmw8,"What made this guy so strong that he could do all they things you described?  Was he on drugs, or just adrenaline rushed or what?"
esPRsT-lmw8,@Bjarne Smith Agree. It could be another talk.
esPRsT-lmw8,It would be interesting if he had gone into some of they ways they improved these people&#39;s brain.
esPRsT-lmw8,"Please try improve your diet and try to exercise or take up some hobby, having a pet is great if you can afford it, hope you get better.👍"
esPRsT-lmw8,"Dear, you&#39;re the most capable person to change yourself. :) It&#39;s already long proved, that our brains has been changing for all our life, and that means, you really can improve it if you work with it. There are many studies that something so simple as regular meditations change your brain. In your case I&#39;d also look into things like good diagnosing for borellia, and also check your levels of metals such as aluminium, mercury etc and if you&#39;re not lacking vitamins, especially d3, b3 and b12. Hope it can be of some help to you, and wish you very best and sending much love! Don&#39;t ever give up on yourself! &lt;3"
esPRsT-lmw8,But how does brain rehabilitation work?
esPRsT-lmw8,heal the emotional trauma
esPRsT-lmw8,I really feel like I need help and dont have ins and feel like I have no options
esPRsT-lmw8,"You think the small amount or large as I&#39;m no dr.  I really dont know what amount is good, not that any is good but would the risk of radiation be worth finding out if something is wrong with me?"
esPRsT-lmw8,I am so sorry to hear of your  experience JefferyB but so glad you made it through.
esPRsT-lmw8,Hi
esPRsT-lmw8,LOL  ! <br> Quite sure this is because he was dealing with a conservative audience who is very sensitive to the issue of taxes.
esPRsT-lmw8,"No thank you. Start feeding the 30000 kids that die every day from preventable hunger and disease due ONLY to a lack of money,  before you start feeding us lies about plant based foods that are just as bad as meat based foods.<br>life feeds on life."
esPRsT-lmw8,"Not before, during. If you&#39;ve read Dr Daniel Amen books, people would fully understand why cops are the way they are. The brain gets worse after they get the job, not before."

esPRsT-lmw8,My condolences
esPRsT-lmw8,I&#39;m so so sorry.
esPRsT-lmw8,That would totally depend on what the problem is.. there is like thousands of treatments.. but one thing he said is a brain smart plan which is again unique and dependent on the unique brain
esPRsT-lmw8,I don&#39;t have answers to your questions. But please hang in there mate and check Google to see where your can get it done - starting with this doctors name.
esPRsT-lmw8,Good morning and happy are you now?

esPRsT-lmw8,"Hi Tania, Not sure how flexible you are on Saturday 11th July but I am attending a zoom call on Brain Health with a speaker called Dr Linseman. Dr Linseman is one of, if not thee top Brian Health research experts in the world he is an Associate Professor in the Department of Biological  Sciences and the Knoebel Institute for Healthy Aging at the University of Denver. He will be speaking in particular about neurotrauma, ALS, Alzheimer&#39;s and traumatic brain injury. The call will max out at 500 attendees . I have space for 10 personal guests available and thought it may be of interest to you, if not totally cool . Let me know one way or the other . Thanks David Haire"

esPRsT-lmw8,David Haire I would very much like to attend if possible.
esPRsT-lmw8,"This speech just isn&#39;t long enough to tell all of the ways Amen Clinics help the brain. The SPECT scans are just a part of the diagnosis process, but what they&#39;ve learned through scanning is huge. I&#39;d say the hope is that by giving this speech, people will  investigate the work of Amen Clinics. I hope this helps."
esPRsT-lmw8,@David Haire I would love to join too
esPRsT-lmw8,"Earlier on in the talk he mentioned that they currently are constrained in their ability to do research. I think the whole point of this is trying to explain that we can solve a lot of mental health/brain issues if we do more research. Essentially &quot;we have the potential to understand this, if only we try&quot;"
esPRsT-lmw8,@David Haire I will also like to attend please!
esPRsT-lmw8,@mcrc trichy Could you explain to me what part of what he said is true?
esPRsT-lmw8,I do research on Regenerative medicine. It is true that spect and other latest investigations need to be understood by more health care professionals to improve accuracy. AI /ML can be used to augment this with caution and checks. Most of what he says is true but not all. Medical guidelines keep changing. We can&#39;t blame someone but be informed and apply our minds to each aspect.
esPRsT-lmw8,"I wish there were more commenters and people like you, Patricia."
esPRsT-lmw8,@Erica G I think the question is more about what the treatment is/looks like etc? All this guy said was that the treatment can help. There was zero explanation about the treatment itself.
esPRsT-lmw8,Wow. Yes he telling you to get your brain looked at if you see a behavioral disorder... How could you not that? That was the point to the whole talk...

esPRsT-lmw8,The lovers of money? Of self?
esPRsT-lmw8,That is literally what he is doing. He is seeing how the brain looks when it works (That&#39;s the SPECT scan he explains) and linking the abnormality observed to the behaviour observed. Then treating according to the functional physical condition of the brain.
esPRsT-lmw8,"Alpha Omega &gt; Linda, are you an ardent Trump supporter? Just curious because it seems like Trump supporters repeat whatever Trump says like cockatoos."

esPRsT-lmw8,Depending on which country you live in it&#39;s standard procedure. Had a scan after my second migraine aura. (cost: 0€)
esPRsT-lmw8,@Mary S what was your issue if you don&#39;t mind sharing?
esPRsT-lmw8,Yes honey and it is evident of my brain injury. But that was the end of it ...no treatment. Just being targeted so pray for  me if you pray   People w disabilities in general are being targeted. They say we are a nuisance and that we should not be living. It&#39;s terrible what I have found out
esPRsT-lmw8,"@JB Darr thanks for the reply. I figured it would be expensive and not covered by insurance. This country doesn&#39;t want people to live long, actually. They dont really encourage people to learn more about their own<br> health so they can have a better life. Oh well. Let&#39;s see what happens in November. Thankfully we still have youtube, so we can educate ourselves and communicate with others."
esPRsT-lmw8,Can’t get the scan he is talking about unless you go to a doctor most insurances won’t cover. Dr amen has clinics he can see you at... for quite a bit of expense to you. Checked into it after my brother had three ischemic strokes and is now in late stage dementia.
esPRsT-lmw8,There are other doctors...
esPRsT-lmw8,"@Tom Hollins Hey dude, how&#39;d the treatment at Amen go for your daughter? I&#39;ve been all over the nation trying different clinics in an attempt to cure a tbi I got from poor nursing, and like you I HAVE to try them all until i get better."
esPRsT-lmw8,@D M You must be one of those haters that think people care about your opinion.
esPRsT-lmw8,"@Jay Breen I appreciate your concerns. I feel like one of those cancer patients who has tried it all, and sees one more thing to try. When one is here, IF it can help her, then we must try to help her. <br>I really do appreciate your info, and especially that you cared enough to post this. I&#39;m going to look into this more. <br>Joetta&#39;s experience might be the outlier or the mainstream. How does one know? Every human is different. Has different reactions to things. So it may help, or not. If not then we will DEFINITELY know.<br>Thank you again for your heart."
esPRsT-lmw8,"@Jay Breen I did that search and the only claims of &#39;junk science&#39; and &#39;snake oil&#39; were made by people who are still treating the brain based on symptoms and guesses.  So I took a chance, and the experience at Amen Clinic was astounding! The doctor described our grandsons behavior issues exactly, just based on what he saw on the scans. Then, he recommended stopping adderoll and adding supplements and guess what? The kid is doing so great!"
esPRsT-lmw8,Try improving blood flow and talk to a doctor about a mri
esPRsT-lmw8,I am so sorry 🙏
esPRsT-lmw8,@Alpha Omega Indeed.
esPRsT-lmw8,Society should be judged by how it treats the victims of criminals. Crickets...because we coddle criminals and drug users and blame victims and law abiding citizens.
esPRsT-lmw8,society should be so diverse so the criminals won&#39;t exist - but all I see is psychopatic indoctrinated walking shells on the street
esPRsT-lmw8,How do you fix the brain
esPRsT-lmw8,"@platonic sage Yes it was incredible, if you would like to watch the recording get in touch!"
esPRsT-lmw8,Taunjia Chandler  they have done this and football players too.  Found a lot of tbi
esPRsT-lmw8,And football players
esPRsT-lmw8,"I agree, it was heart breaking to see mahumad Ali having to fight Parkinson, some people think it has to do with taking to many head shots, so I agree"
esPRsT-lmw8,If you are talking about freestyle or Greco Roman wrestling - these are one of the most brain-friendly combat sports.
esPRsT-lmw8,The best idea is to contact Dr.Daniel Amen. So that he could possibly refer to someone.
esPRsT-lmw8,@Alpha Omega SNORE...bashing good people who work in our VERY exclusive &#39;healthcare&#39; system doesn&#39;t address the problem...DOES IT?
esPRsT-lmw8,"It is not always doctors but hospitals that are corrupt. They get $13,000 to say people died of coviid19. Doesn&#39;t matter if the patient fell of a motorcycle or if someone was shot with a gun. It is in the legislation. 52k to use a ventilator."
esPRsT-lmw8,"@John Woodall Alright Mr. Inventor... if you can come up with a method of imaging the brain that does NOT involve radiation and is not even moderately harmful in this way, then you will be a hero to people (and you could make money off your invention, if you so chose). I&#39;m not criticizing you, I&#39;m saying you have a POINT that needs to be addressed by SOME inventors SOMEWHERE... i. e. the current method is the best we have, but as you&#39;ve pointed out, still has its drawbacks. I&#39;m sure someone can come up with a better method in the future. But, I feel that his doing this project is hardly &quot;reckless&quot; and may have saved many people&#39;s lives."

Hats and clothing, as well as uv blocking cremes will stop ultraviolet rays, but not x-rays and cosmic rays, most of which but not all is blocked by the Van Allen belts surrounding the earth.

esPRsT-lmw8,Where is this quote from?
esPRsT-lmw8,"Yeah.....According to Forbes when Amen&#39;s wife divorced him she took $100,000,000 of his $600 million fortune.  This guy is not running his clinics as a philanthropy."
esPRsT-lmw8,@Emile Bichelberger Understandably.
esPRsT-lmw8,@Jesse Wetherell Yes that may be a good option. Yeah I haven’t heard him on that subject either but it was all I could suggest.
esPRsT-lmw8,"@Emile Bichelberger I think he would do better to contact the person who did the Ted talk and ask him for contacts in his area with professionals who can do what he is asking for.<br>I&#39;m not sure I&#39;ve ever heard J. Peterson talk about brain scans, he is more of an &quot;identify clustering symptoms&quot; kind of psychologist."
esPRsT-lmw8,@Jesse Wetherell It’s no joke. It’s not that easy.
esPRsT-lmw8,@Emile Bichelberger Is that another way to say find god and tidy your bedroom.
esPRsT-lmw8,"The brain is an organ and you need to take care of it like every other organ in the body. For example, if you smoke your lungs start to die, if you drink alcohol your liver and amongst others. He can’t explain how to fix it in this video because everyone has a unique and different brain and will require a different treatment. So like how you have a healthy body, you can have a healthy brain."
esPRsT-lmw8,what info. have u founded?
esPRsT-lmw8,@JamesEis guess he wants people to join his program
esPRsT-lmw8,👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
esPRsT-lmw8,Thank you ! I shall have to check that out now
esPRsT-lmw8,Thanks for referencing this book.  Does it give details of the treatment?  That&#39;s what&#39;s missing from this talk.
esPRsT-lmw8,"@Ju Chu I appreciate the effort you went into the reply. Working on implementing these changes has been a struggle against apathy, anhedonia, but I am here and that is a start"
esPRsT-lmw8,"@Pearl Mas psychiatry helps 1/3 maybe generously up to 1/2 of patients, at least going on effectiveness of meds.  I don’t think it should be done away with, more that caveats be clear. I was sold it was a case of finding the right combo and dose and 20+ years and about as many different combos with little relief and I’m walk away from it.<br><br>This guy is overselling his solution as well as far as I can tell. I don’t know if he is intentionally trying to scam people, he looks to believe it, so may be deluded. Will need to look into his research."
esPRsT-lmw8,@Tamarahope77 it’s only the last few years I’ve found out just how much of a crock psychiatry is. Having been on multiple combination of medication over decades with minimal effect has very much eroded my trust of the field. Have also come across the fellow who did meta studies and found multiple flaws in how these drugs were assessed. <br><br>The issue is now having to come to terms with 20+ years of ineffective treatment on top of still having to sort out why I find it difficult to be at ease with myself. You have any pointers?
esPRsT-lmw8,"When he said this, I was sort of taken aback.  I was like, &quot;wait a minute...that&#39;s true&quot; and from there it&#39;s sort of been a trip down a rabbit hole.  This is fascinating stuff!!"

esPRsT-lmw8,"AI can&#39;t do anything a human can&#39;t program it to do.  But it can be everywhere for free once a human doctor has a diagnosis, symptoms and treatment that works to share.  surgery and drugs don&#39;t do much for most people, though placebo effect is 30%"
esPRsT-lmw8,Read the published paper
esPRsT-lmw8,Good morning and happy are you now?
esPRsT-lmw8,Susan Chu Thanks - I’m currently writing a book.
esPRsT-lmw8,"maissa kaizen my son had grand mal, absence and febrile   seizures. He was tested at Cedars Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles and it was determined he was having over 50 absence seizures a day. After 3 mos of neurofeedback 3 times a week (at that time it was $165/visit) he was cured. He has never had a seizure of any kind again and he’s almost 15. I am currently writing a book. My goal is to start The Colton Foundation (after my son) and gives grants to children who need this treatment. It is very expensive and not covered by insurance. It’s also not invasive and doesn’t involve drugs of any kind."
esPRsT-lmw8,You really should share yiur story
esPRsT-lmw8,Can u explain more
esPRsT-lmw8,Princess things will get better. The Almighty loves you 👍
esPRsT-lmw8,@Shark Fyn  From Japan. Thank you for your kind message.
esPRsT-lmw8,People in the comments are too trusting. Smh.
esPRsT-lmw8,"is it true, that can have an mri without contrast (no radiation barium to drink nor take by injection, not even any form if mixture with gondolinium which is also harmful). ? And does it take 30 minutes?"
esPRsT-lmw8,"Especially if it&#39;s not really invasive, which it is not.  It involves some contrast injection but that&#39;s common in all sorts of studies across the radiologic board.  I&#39;d do it.  This TED talk was something else.  Because if you can fix the brain...I mean...the implications are just...😮😮😮!!!!"
esPRsT-lmw8,@Francesco Beggio isnt it MRI ?
esPRsT-lmw8,I was wondering the same... apparently he’s written a book called ‘change your brain change your life’
esPRsT-lmw8,It is Single-Photon Emission Computed Topography that shows what part of the brain are influenced and have higher activity. All what he had shown are pictures of this method.
esPRsT-lmw8,How?
esPRsT-lmw8,"@Susan DayIt is a &quot;SPECT&quot; brain scan, at the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esPRsT-lmw8&amp;t=3m00s"">3:00</a> mark he mentions it. If you visit his website, I am sure there will be more information there for you."
esPRsT-lmw8,What kind of scan is it ?
esPRsT-lmw8,I&#39;m surprised Foucault didn&#39;t! 🤣
esPRsT-lmw8,Im doing a class on Becoming Your Own Brain Boss if you are interested?
esPRsT-lmw8,He is awesome!
esPRsT-lmw8,It’s all those poor souls who don’t realize why they are sick!!! Sad!!! Tragic !!!!! So unnecessary today!!!!!!!!
esPRsT-lmw8,what exactly is this brain training that he speaks of though? Don&#39;t think he mentioned it..
esPRsT-lmw8,Perhaps  the look of the brain cannot always tell us what is wrong with the person/their behaviour
esPRsT-lmw8,@Matthew McMahon yes definitely
esPRsT-lmw8,"It&#39;s not that simple - our mental health isn&#39;t made up of bits of brain substrate, it is made up of memories and thoughts which determine how we react to things - a whole other field has been dedicated to this for a very long time but sadly doesn&#39;t even get acknowledged by people who seem to be &#39;wowed&#39; by pictures of their brain."
esPRsT-lmw8,"To be frank I&#39;m kind of upset about all the simplification he is making. Behavioral Therapy do show amazing results, and Psychologist are also doing an amazing job at treating patient, without any drugs.<br><br>He really has a populist speech, throwing killer sentences like &quot;Behavioral are not the problem, they are the expression of the problem&quot; while clearly he seems to know more about brain structure than actual reinforcement psychology.<br><br>I like the fact he&#39;s passionate, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s enough to feel enlightened. He spent more times criticizing other médecines that proposing an actual improvement. A good politician."
esPRsT-lmw8,sadly pharmaceuticals are an &#39;easy&#39; fix
esPRsT-lmw8,"@raymond peter No. The more important point is how corruptible it is. People care more about lame jokes than serious matters, I guess."

esPRsT-lmw8,"@Ariane Paradis I hear you, but I also think it depends on the person or where in the world. Some neuropsychologists in Denmark do clinical psychology, educate AND research.<br>But most people prefer to have only one way, true and this, unfortunately, takes therapy out of the equation"
esPRsT-lmw8,@Johannes Bentzon yes but it doesn&#39;t extend to therapy as much as it should. Most of the people in that field focus mostly on research.
esPRsT-lmw8,Neuropsychology specialising in behavioral/cognitive neuroscience pretty much covers the entire spectrum of analysing the different perspective on various brain pathologies. Anyone agrees?
esPRsT-lmw8,"@Star Wise I&#39;m not a lazy person. I&#39;ve always put extra work when other people did not. I always ask myself question. I just realized I was more passionate about something else. Don&#39;t call people lazy it&#39;s rude. Also, a bachelor in psychology is completely different then counseling just so you know. Psychology is very broad it&#39;s not just about therapy."
esPRsT-lmw8,"Oh that doesn’t sound good, because of medications?"
esPRsT-lmw8,hopefully the change will always be for the better; not to help corporations or suchlike
esPRsT-lmw8,"Thanks for your research and sharing your findings. I&#39;m guessing that a younger brain would re-learn better also since with age our brains matter deteriorates over time. I had brain surgery for an A.V.M. i didn&#39;t know i had until i was hit right where it was. Radio Stereo Toxic surgery saved my life but left me with some disabilities. Not one doctor EVER tried to help after that, they simply treated it with meds to &quot;Make me as comfortable as possible&quot;. This is extremely eye opening for me. Again I thank you."

esPRsT-lmw8,What exactly happened
esPRsT-lmw8,Sad to hear-hope you are coping ok
esPRsT-lmw8,"I posted this response to another person&#39;s similar question.   &quot;Please listen to the Polyvagal Theory YouTube videos by Dr. Stephen Porges and some of his followers.  It&#39;s a theory addressing the state of your Central Nervous System and brain; looking the the Autonomic System.  Looking at ways to determine what state of functioning you are in as deteremined by which autonomic state you are in and how to regulate yourself into better states.  Please note the autonomic system is not a conscious system, for example, we don&#39;t have to think about: breathing, pumping blood through our bodies, making our glands secrete, grow our bodies from birth into adults, etc.   I&#39;m not eloquent enough to describe this theory with accuracy but it appears to be a close friend of this brain scan presentation and the question and comments you raise.&quot;"
esPRsT-lmw8,"Consistent use of supplements like omega 3, Bs, Ds and probiotics. As well as regular exercise. Abstaining from bad habits like drugs. Eating healthy and staying hydrated."
esPRsT-lmw8,"@Andrew Kim You&#39;ve seen this? A brain scan is done, treatment ensues and symptoms clear up, and a follow up brain scan is exactly the same?  I&#39;d love to know how you obtained that info because I&#39;ve been looking for it. <br>BTW &#39;standard of care&#39; rules often disallow the newest, best treatments.  I have a BIL, diagnosed with cancer and given 9 months to live.  There was a new treatment still in the experimental stages, so not covered by insurance because it wasn&#39;t &#39;standard of care&#39;.  But because his wife had worked at the hospital as a nurse for 30 years she knew the right people and they approved the drug for him.  Cancer is gone, 2 years later has not come back.  &#39;Standard of care&#39; would have killed him."

esPRsT-lmw8,Awalia Shaw yes
esPRsT-lmw8,One of the more constructive comments here amid an unfortunate sea of inanities.
esPRsT-lmw8,Should be
esPRsT-lmw8,"It is a joke lol, he literally made tons of money by selling a joke. It is not better at detecting mental illness than measuring the size of one&#39;s head."
esPRsT-lmw8,"Aoun Muhammad Yes. For a convict the only thing that will make them function outside of prison, is to actually give them jobs, education, learn how to do stuff they maybe haven&#39;t done before (like pay bills, cook), rehabilitation, healthcare. I guess that is what splits at least America from us. We don&#39;t want our criminals to go back to jail. It&#39;s expensive to hold prisoners, and if they can be a responsible tax-paying citizen after jail - fantastic. Earn money for the society as a whole instead of being a huge expense. Some ofc go back into jail throughout their entire life, in our country it&#39;s addicts usually. They go to jail, and are put through rehabilitation, but ofc - someone might go straight back into the environment they know of, and therefore end up in jail. We can do better, we need to follow through even more. In our country a life sentence is 21 years. But - that doesn&#39;t mean everyone is released after those years, the most dangerous ones are kept in custody until they are releasable, which someone might never be. Anders Behring Breivik for example will be in jail for his entire life, even though the sentence is 21 years (our maximum sentence) - but those that actually CAN be taught differently, should have that opportunity."
esPRsT-lmw8,"That is a question we could put for any problem , in all history of mankind. All problems between humans arise from misunderstanding and insecurity and lack. Both those who are in charge suffer from it and those who are judged. This advance of science is just a little bit more of the veil, 50 y ago we got the idea we were born with DNA that conditions lots of characteristics we cannot control , but need learn to deal with , a bit before we understood that women are not responsible for impregnating with male fetuses ( in fact the male/female descendants is a variable much more associated with the husband, not the woman) ... a bit before the early psychiatrists gave us a picture about &quot;minds differ&quot;... etc and so on. We are in a voyage of discovery both personal and as a community. <br>The only thing we can do , to deal with the shortcomings of our understanding about how to live and help us, is tolerance, keep studying, and try to do our best. Using common sense, work, prevent the strong to abuse the weak, follow basic rules of life (usually summarized in all religions ). <br>We will keep having lack of understanding about many issues. Being humble and not judging too quickly will be enough."
esPRsT-lmw8,"the justice system needs to treat them well in order to bring them up in the mainstream and to make them responsible citizen well, ultimately they people will accept the societal means to achieve their goals"

esPRsT-lmw8,@Antiquarian They stop doing crimes!
esPRsT-lmw8,"@CellGames2006 Or if you think about people who have been to jail and want/need rehabilitation as actual individuals, that would just be an added benefit that might be valued by less empathetic and more monetarily driven individuals."
esPRsT-lmw8,Ikr...
esPRsT-lmw8,@CellGames2006 he&#39;s just mentioning the increased tax payers as one of the benefits.
esPRsT-lmw8,"Fixing peoples brains to get more tax payers? Sounds like 1984 to me... or, more like 2024... Luckily &#39;mericans still have guns so probably not gonna happen. In Europe on the other hand..."

esPRsT-lmw8,"@B. Bailey Logically thats right. I will also be happy if something like this is true. But for a layman, scientific validation is a key to trust the proposal. We do not know much of the technical jargons."
esPRsT-lmw8,"you do bring up a point about radiation - since i have had MRI&#39;s with &quot;contrast&quot; and no one told me the dye they use is radioactive! Still, if SPECT scans show the type of damage that can alter behavior, they are valuable in treatment, don&#39;t you think?"

esPRsT-lmw8,My son boxes -what side effects are you getting?
esPRsT-lmw8,Drew Brew what?
esPRsT-lmw8,@Akhilesh Banerjee what is the positivity to be had from a scam artist? How good do you think it is to tell people with illnesses that you can help them for a fee when you&#39;re doing nothing but taking their money that could have gone to paying for treatments that work?
esPRsT-lmw8,@Alexander Clifford at least he is doing something radical that warrants positivity.
esPRsT-lmw8,"@butterfliesblue1 I specifically said that his studies don&#39;t support the claims he&#39;s making. Seeing as how he&#39;s the one making these claims and he&#39;s the one charging thousands of dollars for treatment, he should be able to provide at least some support for his methodologies. As it stands though his published studies are not designed in a way to provide any support that his interventions have any effect. Designing a study to support a specific intervention is actually pretty easy as you can follow some pretty well established patterns, yet this guy is either unwilling or unable to do so."
esPRsT-lmw8,Good morning and happy are you now?
esPRsT-lmw8,You can have a brain scan at nearly any hospital or outpatient center that has PET scan or SPECT capability.  BUT....you have to have a Doctor&#39;s order...AND a reason for the Doctor to order a scan.  Most primary care docs I know  wouldn&#39;t order a (very) expensive/potentially risky scan like that without just cause.  And most radiologists would not allow them to be performed without adequate clinical indication.  PET scans use radioactive tracers that are injected and PET/CT scans use high doses of x-radiation and radioactive tracers to aquire the images-this type of testing is not without its own potential health risks.

That’s how the human species advances, it’s inevitable. And one day the bottom line will not be a dollar sign, but something much more valuable: the benefit of all living beings. Most likely won’t happen in our lifetime, but one day, because amazing doctors like this one keep fighting for what’s right. Humans are so incredibly complex it’s hard to even fathom, and what little knowledge we have of our behaviors is just the tip of the ice berg."
esPRsT-lmw8,"I don&#39;t think so, people would just create jobs in other things that would be needed. Also pharmaceutical companies don&#39;t subsist only of money from physchiatric deseases, there are so many others. That money would certainly be used for another purpose too."

Negating the opportunity was his problem. this was also 2013. im curious as to what is factual as of now. the study alone at that time is evidence enough that improvement can be made, not for opinion or bias to dismantle, but tangible and emperical success.  <br><br><br>P.S. im stil unsure why people say warsher or warsh... there is no R in wash..

esPRsT-lmw8,@Claude Burrell II a drug is a drug. All have side effects that damage the brain or body
esPRsT-lmw8,Obviously he meant recreational drugs like meth etc. 🤦🏽‍♂️ But you are right when it comes to medication used in psychiatry. It doesn&#39;t solve the problem. Just turn you into a zombie. And that is why he mentions this.

esPRsT-lmw8,"@Marcus Ludicrous No, it&#39;s truth."
esPRsT-lmw8,"Marcus Erroneous it’s really not actually.  I know more about psychiatry.  There’s a lot to a human being, created in God’s image."
esPRsT-lmw8,That&#39;s just ignorance talking.
esPRsT-lmw8,"There&#39;s research available that demonstrates Cannabis ameliorates the symptoms of PTSD. No, you&#39;re not kidding yourself. But it&#39;s not a cure. It controls the physical and emotional pain. A WELL-QUALIFIED psychotherapist who specializes in the treatment of PTSD while you continue to use cannabis for emotional and physical pain control is a good way to proceed. Take it from one who understands some, but not all, of what you&#39;re suffering. I&#39;m a retired psychotherapist who lived through 2 civil wars in central America when I was 8 and 9 years old. I saw a lot of bad stuff that altered the course of my emotional life. My PTSD is mild compared to yours. I really feel for you. But, you don&#39;t have to suffer continually. There is help."
esPRsT-lmw8,Doctor Daniel Amen could you reply to my question above
esPRsT-lmw8,@E San I hear ya.
esPRsT-lmw8,"@ray Nic the fact that he had to clarify after the fact seems sus to me. If it really were about those things, he would&#39;ve mentioned / emphasized on them during his talk."
esPRsT-lmw8,"@E San Actually PBS had him on for one of their annual fund drives and he mentions that he is not saying everyone needs a scan. If memory serves it was about supplements, exercise, a balanced life...what Mr. E said."
esPRsT-lmw8,"@Fair Scale BS I&#39;ve tried that, god is not involved in the daily life of humans, it&#39;s pure BS!"
esPRsT-lmw8,"@Robert Broska Thanks for sharing Robert, not too surprised. That said, I&#39;m from Canada so I don&#39;t know whether that&#39;s reasonable by U.S. standards.<br>More importantly, did the analysis offer benefits that outweigh the cost for your friend?<br>Hope he&#39;s doing better today!"

esPRsT-lmw8,"You only need to fork out for his book to find out! (Spoiler alert, it&#39;s a scam, and he&#39;s not backed up by any science whatsoever or supported by any other psychiatrists)"
esPRsT-lmw8,@De-Stress Chiropractic Most of what I have read shows hat he is not legit.  What makes me believe he&#39;s in it for the $$$ is the recommendation of supplements which are largely snake oil.    It does make sense to me to perform the scans to point to where to start (if applicable) and to rule out certain factors.  Do you feel the scans are not helpful?
esPRsT-lmw8,"Like any other organs, it can be healed"
esPRsT-lmw8,"@DianaLynn1961 So here&#39;s the deal (and I&#39;M not say he&#39;s a huckster) what huckster do is provide a little truth, partial science then says their (and only their) treatment fixes this.  Instead when true scientist research and discover something they publish it so that other scientist can replicate the study  and see if they get similar results.  Two problems currently exist:1) many of the &quot;great studies&quot; have not been replicated, at all.  2) corporations fund a lot of research and won&#39;t let studies that do not support their product or desired outcome be published.  There is little &quot;pure&quot; research being done and even less money for replication."
esPRsT-lmw8,"Well okay, do YOU want to pay for it?? This snake oil salesman really takes the cake."
esPRsT-lmw8,Mexico!

esPRsT-lmw8,Listen to his interview with Jay Shetty...he gives out some stuff there....
esPRsT-lmw8,i saw his main psych dr.. 2009-2012.. they just threw drugs at me (same as any other psychatrist does besides benzos)  and none worked.. and they had done the brains scan... like the ones in this video.. they never actually did anything to fix it... so idk wtf bs hes saying WTF!!!!!!!!. i have a diff dr / left amen clinic they never rehabilitated me.. wtf is this IM LIVID
esPRsT-lmw8,Thank you @Frankie!
esPRsT-lmw8,A cyst.. which is an abnormal growth
esPRsT-lmw8,What is brain rehab?
esPRsT-lmw8,Shock therapy lol
esPRsT-lmw8,@Bobby Chan Yes I found that very suspicious. Regardless of whether or not his &quot;program&quot; works he was obviously trying to sell it otherwise he would just reveal what it is. <br>I think his premise that looking at the brain in times of psychiatric illness is needed but of course it is too expensive for the general population even if there is a straightforward cure. Also I don&#39;t believe that all mental illness would be visible anyway. <br>I still want to get a brain scan though.
esPRsT-lmw8,"~Id like to know too, but im certain one thing would be regularly meditating!~That changes the brain noticeably in just a couple of months!~"
esPRsT-lmw8,Yes. I want to get into it. even thogh i don&#39;t have any injury.

esPRsT-lmw8,Especially ones that think they need medication
esPRsT-lmw8,Yes
esPRsT-lmw8,"There is no brain scan that can guide psychiatric treatment in the vast vast majority of cases. He says psychiatrists don&#39;t look at the organ they treat- yes they do, but when they do look they normally don&#39;t find anything useful. If it was as simple as do a scan and know the disease and treatment there is NO chance they&#39;d waste their time chatting about your life woes.TBI can be seen on a scan and rehabilitation efforts ought to continue- most people with mental illness haven&#39;t had a TBI."

esPRsT-lmw8,@Elvis Neuhardt Network Of course we can change our life for the better mental health. But it wouldn&#39;t repair a severe damage brain. Or would it?

esPRsT-lmw8,"&quot;Chain your brain, change your life.&quot;"
esPRsT-lmw8,"​@Lori Johns Perhaps I didn&#39;t express it well. I mean that everybody is responsible of their decisions because even when we are influenced by nature (DNA) and nurture (things that we learnt from our environment) we also have free will.<br>Of course I can&#39;t prove that we have it, because I don&#39;t think it is possible to prove that and it is impossible to prove otherwise (that we don&#39;t have free will), but it has important implications regarding responsibility."
esPRsT-lmw8,@Colleen Lazoruk I was diagnosed with the same when I was younger. Found out after the fact (after menopause) that the whole time the problems were a result of a hormonal balance. (Not bipolar) I hate labels.

esPRsT-lmw8,Amazing quote.
esPRsT-lmw8,Why certainly ... but then identifying the problem is of key importance ... locating all or even most mental difficulties in the brain - as opposed to the psyche - is a profound error
esPRsT-lmw8,Thanks:D
esPRsT-lmw8,Because we feel pain in the same part of the brain as we feel pain. Reason why in every single alternate medicine beside Opioids. Has anti- depressant. That is why they have changed our physical  pain  is now being pushed to a mental health association. It is not just because a person was diddled with by uncle Frank. Doesn&#39;t cause fibromyalgia. That is from a old injury or operation it build up tissue that presses against nerves. Not emotions. The new budget calls for all of us to be institutionalize !
esPRsT-lmw8,"&quot;Change your brain, change your life.&quot;"
esPRsT-lmw8,"Also why criticize the speaker and not the subject matter? The idea is beautiful, could change lives and how we treat people."
esPRsT-lmw8,"Could be influence from his passion of the subject. Thousands of scans and then helping people with use of those scans. Seeing people improve. The subject is emotive. He speaks with heart as well, he is informing us of his truth not telling us a story."
esPRsT-lmw8,"@Gary Simone Why is he the only Dr who uses SPEC? Whether the medical and psychiatric community wants to admit it or not, MOST, if not all of the decisions they make are motivated by money. If a person came along who could verifiably heal people with a touch, he would be scorned and ultimately murdered. There are simply too many people who have too much to lose."
esPRsT-lmw8,"@Bobby Bradley Researchers use other types of diagnostic tools. His scan have been proven to be ineffective, basically putting people through unnecessary radiations.<br><br><br>The first rule of a doctor is do no harm. If this imaging tool is truly useful, then they should use it on lab rats (as all other researches do), establish a safe dose, and prove its efficacy, and then they can move on to human trials. I went to his website and I cannot find a single paper where they did animal research.<br><br><br>Can you guess why he&#39;s not doing that? Doing that kind of work relies on really hard work (which is why you don&#39;t see real researchers going around writing  best sellers), and pays little (this guy gets 20m each year) compared to him selling snake oil here."
esPRsT-lmw8,@Zack Sherry true but were is the science to prove or is he the only psychiquement Dr in usa that has the answer ??? Hey i with he was right
esPRsT-lmw8,"Zack Sherry I agree. I would any support innovative approach if the user were to guard against bias and use the scientific method to objectively evaluate the approach before charging money for it because it “seems to work.”  And I would add that small steps in the wrong direction can get people lost and cause harms. Misuse of this technology at a minimum risks waste of money and creating a reputation against it, making it hard for a good scientist to propose investigation in the same area because of stigma. We cannot always rely on the scientific method to answer our medical treatment needs, but when it involves radiation exposure and thousands of dollars without a clear theory and evidence to support exploring it further, I think we should lean towards evidence-based medicine and scientific investigation."
esPRsT-lmw8,No great answer to any problem in history didn&#39;t start with small steps. Just about every solution has naysayers in the steps along the way though
esPRsT-lmw8,@Kjrealist777 Say that to Ron Paul. Do you know where your trillion deficit down-paid with your tax dollar originates?

esPRsT-lmw8,"I wonder about all this too and can really relate to your post because I am a 42 year old women who was hit by a Ford F-150 truck when I was 11 years old,  knocked off my bike and thrown 90 feet, I became unconscious right away &amp; in a coma for 8 days. From this accident, I obtained a mild TBI. My Mom has always told me I was a different person before my accident and would often question doctors about this. I remember being told the changes with me could be from the accident and injuries I obtained and told, I was also becoming a teenager so I could be behaving as I was because of being a teen,?etc. . <br>It would be awesome to have an MRI done now. I requested from a former doctor who told I need to quit everything for 3 months in order for referral to be made for an MRI or to even be referred to a Neurologist... I have used many drugs and am addicted to marijuana and tobacco.<br>My take is the addiction and even if may have used if accident had not happened, doesn’t matter to me. What I want to prove is due to my accident &amp; TBI, I became more  of a addictive and impulsive person/personality and more adapt (possible) to use drug abuse. I also have not been married (yet) and basically see it that I am unable to maintain life-long relationships with those I love and have loved..."
esPRsT-lmw8,That was only one time tho. It probably wasn’t as severe as you’re saying but could he have issues because of familial genes?
esPRsT-lmw8,Pat Sanchez he needs to tell his doctor and get a referral for an MRI

esPRsT-lmw8,Doctor Kaboomer why i got the feeling they are just selling nootropics as a revolutionary medical program 😒
esPRsT-lmw8,Don’t you think a little bit of research from your part could help? I mean we cannot expect to always be giving everything.
esPRsT-lmw8,"@Doctor Kaboomer I was cured of chronic depression by micro doses of ketamine, a very quick very cheap way to escape depression. It&#39;s like my brain forgot how to be that depressed."

esPRsT-lmw8,"I agree. I&#39;ve been waiting for him to give examples of treated patients, but it&#39;s always comparison after comparison of brain scans. When he mentioned brain rehabilitation of criminals he didn&#39;t mention how it could be done. When he said it would be cheaper, he didn&#39;t mention in what aspect. My first thought was &quot;how?&quot; When there is not even enough psychiatrists for mental hospitals let alone a prison. This medical procedure looks promising and seems to have great potential, but i do wish he gave more conclusions. So much time was wasted in showing brain scans I didn&#39;t even figure ouy what the one lesson is."

esPRsT-lmw8,"I work in a Psychiatric Hospital, and I can tell you that the reason Psychiatrists and other professionals don&#39;t jump on this, is because they make too much $money$!

Dr. Amen and his work will revolutionize the World, once society allows it to become the standard."

esPRsT-lmw8,@Tracy Kay 💓
esPRsT-lmw8,"Yes. Good place to start is with mental health. That would end child abuse and abusive behavior across the board. Sick brains and minds do insane things and sick societies are not in the business of healing sick minds. Sick societies ignore them, monetize through them, punish them, hide them away,  or destroy them. There is excessive interest in blame, shame, condemnation, and profit but very little ambition to heal a problem for purpose of solution. We need to evolve."
esPRsT-lmw8,"This is the hardest thing to do, but I’m pretty sure I’m about to dedicate my life to the ACE problem to try and change this!"
esPRsT-lmw8,Awesome comment. People with healthy brains are less likely to be abusive.
esPRsT-lmw8,"It isn’t poverty that leads to abuse. They are plenty of poor people who don’t take out their stress on children. They are plenty of rich people who still take out their stress on children. Depends on your view of your lifestyle. This has everything to do with values taught when the parent themselves was a child. And that’s why childcare is the most important job in the world. Our labor system (US) is such that there is less and less work life balance, two income families are the norm and it just doesn’t support the demands of good childcare."
esPRsT-lmw8,"@George xeno actually, dianetics is a dimwitted convolution. Soul is a separate entity! Just like an operating system is in a computer. No soul, no human life. Now, about contradictory set of ideas to any realistic  view does have a basis or bias. If psychiatrists in general or not looking at empirical evidence, then that&#39;s bad practice. It&#39;s the central idea of the video. Who is evaluating what the psychiatrist is doing?"
esPRsT-lmw8,Ahad OC o no! We cannot serve God and mammon. I mean when we pay for something the mutually beneficial trade would mean we are supposed to also gain. I’m sorry for your financial loss. I’m also sorry for your brain injury. Where there is life there is hope. Are you ok?

esPRsT-lmw8,"The health food industry has been growing by leaps and bounds since the 70s, but now is reaching another obstacle. <br>Parents are letting their children choose what food they eat,  4 and 5 year old children do not understand the human body and choose with their palate. <br>Sugar is destroying brains at a very early age.  That in combination with processed GMO wheat with no germ,  and no fiber is creating toxic substances inside children&#39;s bodies that inhibit the growth of the brain.  We can add to that all the leach gasses from plastic toys and new carpeting into compromised  nutrient assimilation.  Thus turning this important developmental stage of life into a dumbing down of the human brain. Never gets a chance to properly grow. <br>Blame the parents who do not love their children as fragile animals that must be taught for years before they can choose on their own. <br>A national test and license to bear children would be a good idea.

esPRsT-lmw8,You should do fasting man..
esPRsT-lmw8,"@Siti Aisyah Mohd Aziz right, my point exactly"
esPRsT-lmw8,hipa90 he did said something about brain rehabilitation program
esPRsT-lmw8,"Yes, I thought I missed something. How do Drs fix these brains?"
esPRsT-lmw8,Do more brain scans in order to diagnose illnesses and select the best treatments. That&#39;s about it.
esPRsT-lmw8,It’s funny and sad
esPRsT-lmw8,EXACTLY
esPRsT-lmw8,Medication and therapy but knowing exactly what they were dealing with
esPRsT-lmw8,It’s true.
esPRsT-lmw8,you should google that guy&#39;s name. You&#39;ll understand why there are dislikes to this video.
esPRsT-lmw8,I think that its not that they don&#39;t like the video but instead they don&#39;t like the fact that these people were not treated fairly but not being scanned and how they were treated by their health system
esPRsT-lmw8,It&#39;s because this guy feels part of the reason we exist to pay taxes
esPRsT-lmw8,The &#39;system&#39; makes a fortune off brain injured victims.
esPRsT-lmw8,"6.1k for now, the damage spreads 😂"
esPRsT-lmw8,D Griffin I like you
esPRsT-lmw8,Ivan Rubil LOL
esPRsT-lmw8,What?
esPRsT-lmw8,I have personally known this for about 20 years. But then I&#39;m a brain injured genius.

esPRsT-lmw8,@Yematul i heard from a Doktor/researcher gratin his opinion trump had Lyme borreliose. This would explain his behaviour
esPRsT-lmw8,Johnnell Thomas  not all true at all !!!! What I want no one can give me or can I give myself 🤦‍♀️ it’s facts.
esPRsT-lmw8,"IMPORTANT MESSAGE!!! You create your reality 1st in your MIND then in your REALITY...once you&#39;ve accomplished your vision in your mind,once you&#39;ve given your brain a directive it&#39;s imperative that you RELAX and regulate your heart beat and just watch how the energy from your THOUGHTS team up with the energy from the universe to bring you what&#39;s already yours...our brains are designed to serve US everything is already yours the reason why you don&#39;t have it is because you lack belief in your own thoughts"

esPRsT-lmw8,You keep your hammer in the kitchen?...🧠 🔨
esPRsT-lmw8,So you can go get a brain scan from him? Why?
esPRsT-lmw8,He wants funding from the govt to fund his research project. Taxes is how he sells them his idea
esPRsT-lmw8,"@Jackie Benson Yeah, I got it. And the quip was clever maybe once, but he repeated it at least three times."
esPRsT-lmw8,"The speakers point is that instead of taxpayers funding a prison cell for Andrew or some other form of free help, with proper diagnosis Andrew can pay taxes rather than be a tax burden. Valid point, but hardly the most important one."
esPRsT-lmw8,"Nothing in this world is without flaw. I find that if even one life, if one person has seen an improvement in their quality of life, then that is an immeasurable amount of success. People don&#39;t always get things right the first time around; that&#39;s the beautiful thing about research, that there is always another layer, another way to do things better. Though, that was not the point of his speech. The point was that this is a start. And if it&#39;s a start that&#39;s already helped multiple people who can now contribute to society, then I find that to be a pretty good beginning."
esPRsT-lmw8,Essential Oils.
esPRsT-lmw8,As others have said it&#39;s more disturbing this has got as many upvotes as it has. The consensus opinion of the experts in his field is that Amen is a fraud.
esPRsT-lmw8,"It seems that there is more than a decent chance that the business he runs around this premise is a scam. It has almost no scientific backup, which is a shame because Id really want this to to be true."
esPRsT-lmw8,"It&#39;s a scam- it&#39;s not been proven to be accurate. I mean, if this was actually real, wouldn&#39;t this be groundbreaking news in the neurological and psychiatric fields? There&#39;s a reason it&#39;s not, because it&#39;s not proven."
esPRsT-lmw8,6000 people failed the brain scan.

esPRsT-lmw8,"chloe mcentire where do you live? In my country, it’s easy to get a brain scan and its usefulness is common knowledge. 🤦‍♂️"
esPRsT-lmw8,(1) Do brain scans before you judge (2) realise that with well thought out training you can improve a damaged brain
esPRsT-lmw8,"The speaker mainly just addressed the point that brain treatment no longer needs to just be guesswork based on patient&#39;s behaviour and symptoms, which is already a huge improvement from current available treatments. <br><br><br>As for the actually healing, different conditions definitely have different ways of treating (like the boy had to have a cyst removed for instance) so I really doubt he could touch on them all in the short 15 mins."
esPRsT-lmw8,"If you look up &#39;neuroplasticity&#39;, it gives you an idea of the short term behaviors the brain can change. Long term, cell repair can take years, but it happens. Just do the right thing, it will come."
esPRsT-lmw8,@Nasim Nb fine then 😂
esPRsT-lmw8,"Nicholas Vanlierde I don’t care what it sounds like, it’s a book and 13 CD audio book. Google it"
esPRsT-lmw8,@Nasim Nb that doesn&#39;t sound like a book on treating brain trauma or brain disease. It sounds like an inspiring self help book
esPRsT-lmw8,"dixxo nikk because there is none, indeed. Another one of “those” ted talks."
esPRsT-lmw8,"Just a guess, but by defining the overly active parts of the brain or vice-versa, you can then design exercises (mostly mental) for said parts of the brain. Even some medication can be used to lower the activity if needed."
esPRsT-lmw8,Great question. I am with you on this 100%. He wants to impress people as opposed to helping them. How can ppl who suffer mental issues get help from this video?
esPRsT-lmw8,UHFStation1 exactly
esPRsT-lmw8,if you live in the US and you can afford it you could go to one of his clinics..
esPRsT-lmw8,google it then lol i did and i found other ted talks by dr amen you should watch them
esPRsT-lmw8,"@Daveinet I agree with your statement about original thought. On depression, most people dont realise that super positive people are often the ones to have the greatest breakdowns. Trying too hard to do good things."
esPRsT-lmw8,"@Nicholas Vanlierde A &quot;Can do&quot; attitude does work if the damage is not that great. If the damage is great, such as one who is a drug addict or even suffers from severe depression, they may not have enough can do attitude to overcome and rebuild the brain. But take someone who has gotten off drugs without external medication. No denying it&#39;s a long hard road, but it has been done. <br><br><br><br>Incidentally, you seem to have claimed that original thought is just putting existing pieces together, however the ability to do that is original. Even looking at Sci-Fi, the ability to imagine something that does not previously exist is an original creation. Its not just a predictable outcome of existing input."
esPRsT-lmw8,"@Christof L your points of argument aren&#39;t very clear, you know that?"
esPRsT-lmw8,"@Christof L Ok, I see what you are getting at now. Yes, i did find that seeing a lady who used &#39;body talk&#39; which was about realigning brain waves through touch and specific techniques helped quite a lot, I should have seen her more. However my cousin who lost her husband, said it didn&#39;t help at all. I will check out L. Ron Hubbard. But he isnt just talking about a &#39;can do attitude&#39; which is what i thought you were getting at, he is talking about silencing the areas of the brain that are about animal instincts. I see what you mean now. I am skeptical about the founder of scientology, but i&#39;ll read it."
esPRsT-lmw8,@Nicholas Vanlierde Changing your thoughts does change your reality and solves your problems.  Study some L.Ron Hubbard.

esPRsT-lmw8,Carlos Price happy now you lil keyboard warrior?
esPRsT-lmw8,Aaand he&#39;s a proven fraudster with 30 years old outdated technology that does not do what he says. He&#39;s completely full of BS unfortunately.
esPRsT-lmw8,Sorry asking you is it expensive and to what cost ?
esPRsT-lmw8,@Nicholas Vanlierde Because?
esPRsT-lmw8,He&#39;s a fraud
esPRsT-lmw8,what

esPRsT-lmw8,"The fact that you made this comment in this video, says a lot more about you than about Pelosi&#39;s supposedly blank scan. Have you taken a look to your own brain scan?"
esPRsT-lmw8,Joanna Rodas the clinic is called Amen clinic
esPRsT-lmw8,"@D4rk Horse Out of pocket cost ballpark, if you don&#39;t mind relaying?"
esPRsT-lmw8,@Joanna Rodas Amen Clinic. I went to the one in Orange County which is the one he is based out of. I think there are like 8 locations in the US tho. He also has written a few books. Got one for free when I went.
esPRsT-lmw8,VIVA LA REVOLUTION what’s the name and location of his clinic?
esPRsT-lmw8,Kimberly Hovis I went to one of his clinics in California and it was amazing. Didn’t see him directly but saw another psychiatrist that helped me a lot
esPRsT-lmw8,"@Ramen Grott oh resorting to personal insults is the lowest form of rhetoric. It&#39;s a shame you have had to resort to argumentum ad hominem. End of conversation, you&#39;ve just managed to prove your own lack of ability to discuss a subject."
esPRsT-lmw8,Wayne Scott I guess using your brain to formulate tenable arguments and explain evidence isn&#39;t a skill of yours. Guess you have no idea what you&#39;re talking about 😃
esPRsT-lmw8,@Ramen Grott You know there&#39;s this great site that can help it&#39;s called Google oh and there&#39;s one other Wikipedia.. do some fecking research and educate  yourself
esPRsT-lmw8,Wayne Scott Could you enlighten me regarding your aversion towards him? His speech was convincing but I have no idea who he is or what his technology actually does.
esPRsT-lmw8,@Ramen Grott he got his degree from Oral Roberts university.. that should say enough about his charlatan beliefs.  Perhaps that his methods and the actual technology he&#39;s using is out dated and superseded by MRI and other more accurate methods.
esPRsT-lmw8,"@Irene Hashimoto <br>My somewhat flippant remark was only concerning the paucity of the overall understanding of the human brain, which , by all accounts, is the most complex thing yet known! <br>I hope u weren&#39;t offended and wish u all the best in your endeavours. I have always thought that teaching is a most important profession and I&#39;m so glad u seem to realise the impact u have on young people&#39;s lives! (Unlike the ones I had!)"
esPRsT-lmw8,"@Oxcart Dr. Amen seems to know a great deal about brans.  I, being a public school teacher, think our profession needs to collaborate with the neurologists to help our students maximize their brains&#39; potential.  I for one am probably an undiagnosed ADD and had I been SPECT, I would not have endured the early developmental and emotional trauma.  AI experts have been studying brains for many decades now but only recently have we seen the applications of their research findings.  My profession suffers from a lack of scientific and research rigor.  Hence, we are still testing our students on the recall of content knowledge, not ingenuity and collaborative skills, the key barometers of a sustainable civilization."
esPRsT-lmw8,I honestly can&#39;t tell if this is sarcastic or not and it&#39;s confusing me.
esPRsT-lmw8,Nobody knows much about brains!
esPRsT-lmw8,"Irene Hashimoto <br>Even worse, these educators brainwash their students, to the agendas of the elitists."

esPRsT-lmw8,"@ChadDad123 Oh Yes you are, and it&#39;s far more than UHC.   What&#39;s interesting is the way this TED series coaches presenters to make them appear vulnerable that, in-turn solicits empathy to further engage the audience.  This user-generated forum invites the extended audience to engage collectively.  Collective thought - safety in numbers; like a clique of third graders pretending to be socialites.   Just give them a free internet, a parallel reality, no accountability, and a meager existence - they will all go running to their safe space to find their &#39;G&#39; spot and do anything they are told.  Critical thinking skills - a deprogramming in progress ?"
esPRsT-lmw8,elli003 I haven’t listened yet but judging from the comments he’s pushing the universal health care agenda somewhat successfully. Amiright?
esPRsT-lmw8,if you&#39;re like me...because you asked you have to seek it and live by a code. Chivalrous  code.
esPRsT-lmw8,@TINA H. Great idea -it should be a part of every medical examination.
esPRsT-lmw8,Should be a prerequisite to get on the ballot 😂
esPRsT-lmw8,😂😂😂😂😂 yes please!!
esPRsT-lmw8,Olcay did you even get the point of the video my guy... He’s saying there’s no single type of treatment and that people need specific treatment tailored to them based off brain scans and data... it’s about making treatment more personal not a mass cure
esPRsT-lmw8,Yes and the government doesn t care if yu die witjout healthcare.
esPRsT-lmw8,HopelessNerd Insurance companies allow what the government tells them.
esPRsT-lmw8,"Platform Strange  I totally agree. Unfortunately, Americans hear &quot;universal health care&quot; and panic because the gummint would be involved. Like they&#39;re not already. Last time I went in for medical repair, what the insurance company would &quot;allow&quot; was the first consideration. That&#39;s a recipe for disaster. Bankruptcy due to medical bills is a huge problem. It just shouldn&#39;t be that way."
esPRsT-lmw8,"@Seanerzat thank you for catching that name. You are right, it&#39;s a SPECT scan! Now this reveals more about how the underlying system works. For example, this SPECT scan requires injection of a radioactive tracer, into the patient. Thanks again."
esPRsT-lmw8,He said it&#39;s a SPECT scan
esPRsT-lmw8,I&#39;m going to guess PET
esPRsT-lmw8,How do I get this type of treatment
esPRsT-lmw8,"It would be an incredible upgrade not only for the individual, but also for the corporations processing that data. They already have a rich history of using information to cleverly manipulate the population for profit. Imagine the possibilities for them once we willingly give them direct insight into our heads. It is also going to create the best environment for hackers. A single individual with high enough skill will be able to acquire the state of mind of key figures such as politicians and extort, predict actions of and manipulate entire nations. However, mankind’s technological progress cannot be stopped, it is only a matter of time until such a reality arrives"

My heart and his heart and the whole family hearts are bleeding . We need HELP desperately . Are you connected with the doc? How can I get in touch with the office ... if he had one. Again thank you for your response as it shows that a complete stranger cares.
esPRsT-lmw8,Mona Ellis someone commented the dr amen sells vitamins
esPRsT-lmw8,Good morning and happy are you now?
esPRsT-lmw8,EDWARD91 END it’s worth it to watch the whole thing but the last 5-6 minutes
esPRsT-lmw8,True.
esPRsT-lmw8,The CHANGE Providers one person’s comment from research is the dr’s treatment is buying and taking his vitamins
esPRsT-lmw8,I don’t disagree with either comment. The issue is cultural acceptance in regards to using an image to make something real and therefore elicit compassion. My thing is education about mental health should be systemic in school so that kids don’t develop the biases that leads to the isolation behavior you are talking about. Also even if imaging is proven you will still have a significant number of the population ignoring it and still stigmatize. Just like the antivax movement people will ignore evidence that goes against their strong beliefs. As far as the second comment that is all well in good if the imaging modality is proven to show what it says. The problem is the modalities have not been proven. Functional MRIs had more hope but even those studies are now called to question. I agree that the current manners of assessment are too subjective given interperson differences of opinion which is why I focus on psychosocial variables you can “treat” that improves and potential prevent the majority of conditions. I’m sure Dr Amen’s brain smart program addresses those things. It’s just that in the right system of management imaging for everyone wouldn’t be necessary. Since SPECT is not a proven modality for differentiating different mental illnesses it is a very dangerous and slippery slope. It likely does better with differentiating a “normal” brain and abnormal one. But unless he has demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity which he hasn’t done other than to possibly pick and choose cases then the danger is you can miss some people who need management or worse you can treat people for a condition they don’t actually have. It’s basically just as he mentioned that not using imaging leads to misdiagnosis and mismanagement. Unless there is rigorous blinded research that proves his points about imaging you will not only have the same problems using SPECT but the cost is exorbitant.
esPRsT-lmw8,"Looking at the brain just seems obvious. How else can one make an accurate assessment? In software engineering, the behavior of a program gives clues as to what the problem is, and possibly where to look for it. But, until you see the actual code, you can&#39;t fix it. There&#39;s only so much you can glean from talking to someone, especially when a given symptom can have multiple possible causes. I can&#39;t imagine why imaging the brain isn&#39;t just an automatic first step (other than cost). After all, without the brain, there is no psychology."
esPRsT-lmw8,"If someones behaviour is so far beyond the norm as to be socially problematic, they are either drugged into stupor or they withdraw and live on the streets or prison. Many people are quite frightening to deal with because we see them as mad or bad and therefore unpredictable. A scan showing a possible physical cause is much more likely to elicit empathy and compassion and help rather than throwing them on the human scrap heap."
esPRsT-lmw8,Maybe there&#39;s something in it.
esPRsT-lmw8,"Buy them the next round, a lot easier and less painfull."
esPRsT-lmw8,I agree with your view.Our national food supply and the daily exposure to hundred of chemicals in our environment from printed receipts you get at wall mart to the shampoo people use every day is one of the many factors that effect our health and in turn our mental health..I have to disagree with your view on healthcare somewhat..I have been a nurse for 30 years and while the system is broken the people and technology in that system have saved and improved the lives of millions over the years..
esPRsT-lmw8,"Health Care Industries rely on sick people for their survival, not well ones. According to the CDC about 6 in 10 Americans have at least one chronic illness. That’s promising for business...Why would they recommend things that that threaten their job outlooks?"
esPRsT-lmw8,"@Joe X not saying I beleive him or not but it got my attention to look further into it some day if needed. If we had that logic through history how would we have innovated to get to the modern medicine we enjoy now. If we just said &quot;well all the other doctors are doing lobotomys and this one guy says it&#39;s bad, he is bs&quot; we wouldnt really get anywhere. Modern medicine is great but there is always ways to improve, immediately shutting them down isnt gonna get us anywhere."
esPRsT-lmw8,"@Ethan Ford And you just believe him?  How do you even know that the diagnosis he&#39;s making is even correct? That the scans that he sells for $4,000 a pop even mean anything?<br><br> He&#39;s aapears to be the the only Dr that does these scans. Other doctors do brain scans as well using technology that is widely studied, tested, and used in the medical profession. <br><br>Why would they do brain scans at all if they just wanted to dope people up?"
esPRsT-lmw8,"Isnt that the entire point of his speech? he is saying doctors dont use scans just dope people up, and wants that to change."

esPRsT-lmw8,Yeah generalizing is a huge human error. When we group people as if they are all the same then we will always be wrong about how we treat one another. Sort of makes you realize how much societal standards blanket statements everyone and is really a big problem as it strips individuality and convinces people to rely on a larger governmental power to be considered normal.

The scan is a basically a must on old people with probable dementia, kids and young people with sudden change of behavior (tumors are always a possibilitiy). For depression  and anxiety, usually, you start with low-dose of meds and therapy, but if you dont see any changes or improvements in 3-6 months or worst synthoms earlier, you take a scan."

esPRsT-lmw8,"Izzy Britton I believe what he is referring to with the images is the blood flow and nerve conduction within the brain. Therefore, in a healthy brain, you will get normal blood flow and conduction throughout the brain so the image will have the likeness of an intact brain. However, with Alzheimer’s, you are not getting enough blood flow and conduction to certain areas of the brain which causes the memory problems and therefore the scan isn’t of an intact brain since there are parts or “holes” of the brain where there is inactivity."

esPRsT-lmw8,"Perala...I can maybe answer a simple part of your question...natural fats, such as avocados, nuts, and coconut actually help the brain to function better. Other fats that you find in highly processed foods are that damaging fats, particularly the trans fats and saturated fats. Walnuts, in particular are helpful for people who struggle with mild depression (sunlight, exercise, a healthy diet of whole foods, fresh air and a belief in God are also key to mental and physical health). Hope that helps some! :)"

esPRsT-lmw8,Marco Bonechi stop lying and saying nobody since it makes it a more insurmountable task if people tell you it’s very difficult. I cook and eat 70-80% home cooked meals and I have saved loads of money in doing so (trust me the math adds up) and since I make meals ahead of time I only cook for about an hour and a half 2-3 days a week (varies by recipe and what I’m craving) this is not difficult I think the main part is people being burdened by other areas of their life or possibly not giving themselves the time needed to transition into a new lifestyle and by people telling them “it’s impossible bro” when in actuality you never gave yourself a chance and probably never even attempted
esPRsT-lmw8,"@Marco Bonechi Really? You need to visit India. Every household above the poverty line eats healthy. Really healthy. Fresh meals are cooked daily, thrice a day. Thanks to the hardworking moms."

esPRsT-lmw8,"TBH I love Dr Amen’s philosophy and the personalized treatment approach does make sense. I’m just not so sure the SPECT imaging gives as much reliable information as he portrays. They have even called to question the information from fMRIs which was a bigger hit because more doctors supported that modality. I still use the premises in conversation because it can be helpful when talking about brain development. The thing is when I first listened to Dr Amen his philosophy and manner of speak resonated with my own. I was turned off when he talked about SPECT imaging because he used it to make the situation “real” for his patients. The true benefit to appropriate therapy is in making the situation real for patients and those around them and rebuilding a lot of the psychosocial building blocks that have fallen out of place or were never built up. I am against a med only approach as I’m sure Dr Amen is as well. With my approach I make the situation real for the majority of my patients with talking so much cheaper approach. There are always a small percentage of people whom are in toxic denial of their issues, maybe they could be turned to belief with an imaging study. Bottom line is very few people (especially general practitioners whom are the frontline as I am) see mental health in the way that I do and manage and speak to patients in the way that I do. We did a survey amongst 78 of my colleagues about communication and connecting with patients. I was only 1 of 3 whom scored above 90%. 40 scored less than 20%. If you can’t even connect with your patient you cannot help them even with the right approach. That survey alone was telling and we again are generalists whom main job is coordinating care and communication. I’m sure these statistics hold close if you assess the broader body of physicians. We all overestimate our own abilities and underestimate those of others but the people’s whom opinions truly matter are our patients."

esPRsT-lmw8,nishant pandey That psychiatrists are the only doctors that don&#39;t usually look at the organ they&#39;re treating! It&#39;s ridiculous! They should be treating all individuals according to what they see wrong in their brain scans.
esPRsT-lmw8,That&#39;s what I was wondering....
esPRsT-lmw8,Brandon Despard what
esPRsT-lmw8,"marilena kanata Really? I honestly couldn’t understand what point he was trying to make. We (the affected) should all do the brain rehabilitation? But what is it consisting of? So much talk but no specific guide other than diet and exercise (which are important but often are not enough). The blueberry doctor, this is how I remember him from his PBS shows like 10 years ago"
esPRsT-lmw8,Shikha Jindal not sure how the re-wiring should be done
esPRsT-lmw8,"@Kate Anderson Kate, he is talking about brain activity. If people are suffering from some serious disorders can be easily seen through their brain scan which is tough to diagnose otherwise and through rewiring of brain one can have a better cure of such ailments."
esPRsT-lmw8,Shikha Jindal Really? I honestly couldn’t understand what point he was trying to make. We (the affected) should all do the brain rehabilitation? But what is it consisting of? So much talk but no specific guide
esPRsT-lmw8,ChoccoMonsta and purchase your books and shows lol
esPRsT-lmw8,silvia thomas this doctor has ambiguous references. Do some good research before you buy into his theory. Diet and exercise are important but the medical treatment should not be ignored

esPRsT-lmw8,How do u learn to meditate
esPRsT-lmw8,but dont the actions we take actually depend on the brain? catch 22?
esPRsT-lmw8,"@tita adorno thats not what i was trying to say. From what i have seen mostly in the comments, people are saying that this guy is a fraud so i just randomly asked this guy if he thinks this dr is a fraud since he seems to be smart or something?"
esPRsT-lmw8,@taha qtr you obviously didn&#39;t understand what he said. He is not against what dr has said but just mentioning how meditating LITERALLY improves the brain.  Scientifically proven.
esPRsT-lmw8,Do you think This Dr. Is bluffing and is a fraud?
esPRsT-lmw8,"What he is missing in his talk is that there are no solutions to the issues he sees in those images. Let&#39;s say, you experienced mild head trauma (everyone does, just get up at the same time and bump against someone&#39;s head), you might see it in the pictures. <br>But that doesn&#39;t help those who experienced it. <br>No matter, what kind of damage was done, the solutions are always the same - with or without images: nutrition and rest. Treatment will not change. His approach is useless. <br>Instead of looking at mri images, you should assume the worst case and think, what YOU can do to improve it. <br>Your brain can heal. <br>That is what matters. What he promotes is waiting for pharmacologists to come up with something for you. He wants you to be a victim."
esPRsT-lmw8,what came out of it? Is there a chance to get better?
esPRsT-lmw8,"Same for me. I&#39;m going to get a scan for my son. He has ADHD, ASD and is developmentally delayed."
esPRsT-lmw8,"But her&#39;s already was damaged. You don&#39;t do that to people, especially not children."
esPRsT-lmw8,"@Liam Tomas That&#39;s a good enough reason - unless it&#39;s clearly rubbish. The claim Musk has made are in &#39;Elon Musk time&#39;- meaning they are possible, but maybe not as soon as he hopes."
esPRsT-lmw8,Feralz what’s neuralink?
esPRsT-lmw8,Buster Maxxwell there is literally no evidence to what he is saying. People believe everything just because it’s a ted talk
esPRsT-lmw8,Spiderus... you need a brain scan. 😂 PS: The correct cliche is “Snake oil salesman.” You’re welcome.
esPRsT-lmw8,Like what? Being debunked as a snake oil seller. There are no scientific researches that support his claims.
esPRsT-lmw8,@Lazlo They used to believe the brain could not heal itself. How wrong could they get? Sell more meds that way?
esPRsT-lmw8,Yep
esPRsT-lmw8,And that&#39;s the main lesson here.
esPRsT-lmw8,That is because we know really little about higher developed brains basicly nothing. No one can explain how a thought is manifested trough chemical signals. So why look at pictures of something you cannot understand it will not tell you anything. Its not like your Lung or heart which we understand a 100%.
esPRsT-lmw8,@Mieke Schaffner What did his doctors diagnose him with?
esPRsT-lmw8,Then go get a scan and stop blaming people

esPRsT-lmw8,"The guy said to look into mindfulness right? He&#39;s right. Implement what you learn (tip: filter what you think about, especially negative things, be positive). Also, I am assuming that you use your phone before you sleep? That will destroy your sleep and probably sleeping pattern. Also, before you sleep I suggest you make sure the room is cool, quiet and dark. Good luck"
esPRsT-lmw8,Don&#39;t know how accessible a brain scan is for you but I would definitely try to look into mindfulness therapy/apps for your problems if you haven&#39;t done so already

esPRsT-lmw8,@Susie Clark and yet he found a wife. That&#39;s impressive
esPRsT-lmw8,​@Kate Anderson  Every case is different. i believe he was more making a point that its a duty that people working in his field should be looking at the brain as an organ as opposed to basing diagnostics from behaviour. thus enabling the right treatment plan. What a legend!
esPRsT-lmw8,"Sheila6020, that’s what I was waiting to hear also 🙁"

I&#39;m not saying anti-depressants are the solution, I&#39;m just saying SPECT isn&#39;t a solution in the way Amens is using it. The brain is a very complex organ and scientists are just beginning to understand parts of it. Therefore, you need proof if someone makes big claims such as Amens does. We simply can&#39;t trust a good story from someone who sounds convincing."
esPRsT-lmw8,"@Natasha Lee Music That is exactly the problem, his story sounds convincing, hence my warning. However, he exposes people to harmful radiation with SPECT while there is no scientifically proven benefit, he has articles written about him on Quackwatch, and he is make millions of dollars in the process.

esPRsT-lmw8,I know one MD who looks at the whole body. She is the exception most of the time.
esPRsT-lmw8,Panos A You are right !
esPRsT-lmw8,Mitch Evans — you have very little understanding of psychology.
esPRsT-lmw8,Broxine that’s not true
esPRsT-lmw8,"Mitch Evans: if you are in the US, you have it  backwards: psychiatrists are M.D.s who are licensed to prescribe medications and perform procedures. Psychologists rely on therapy, often involving talking, and cannot prescribe medication. I am NOT saying one is better than the other; M.D.s, PhDs, MSWs, and many other sorts of behavioral health practitioners work together to help their patients/clients."
esPRsT-lmw8,"The real truth, flight or fight."
esPRsT-lmw8,I like your comment.Public outcry on mental health is starting to bring a change to lock&#39;em up syndrome.The mental health of society is important to the masters a false test results could end up being detrimental to them.
esPRsT-lmw8,"TP Licorice We get the process, we get the message, but how can so many people in the world, afford something that ranges between $270 with incredible insurance, to those who arent offered good insurance or cant pay the premiums and it costing upwards of $5,000.  Surprised a lot more people havent commented or liked yours, it’s the one that makes the most sense.  Make it affordable, the country can potentially heal itself, he started the curiosity, let’s let the people make the decision to heal themselves, instead of being driven insane with the drugs that mostly seem to be ineffective.  I agree with you TP Licorice."
esPRsT-lmw8,"Paul Dominic It’s completely safe - yes things like prolonged radiation is carcinogenic however, so is the Sun (it shines RADIOACTIVE waves at you constantly), it’s the length and amount of exposure that matters my friend. <br><br>Mutations in your DNA during replication happens constantly (nonsense mutations for example) however for there to be a detrimental effect the exposure would have to be severe, and over a long period of time to cause a mutation that would cause rapid cell replication in the form of a tumour. These medical instruments are vigorously tested before trialed on even animals let alone trialed on humans to prevent this from happening (by limiting the time, area targeted, and the amount of radiation exposure basically), which is also why you’re limited to the amount of X-Rays you can get in a year as well."

I know nothing about neurologists; but I have seen many psychiatrists, in three different countries in Europe; and none of them checked the brain of any patient they diagnosed...

esPRsT-lmw8,yeah .. thats what i think .. this was made as an advertisement.

esPRsT-lmw8,Amy Minjarez that’s a great news! Unfortunately we are still struggling with our loved one while doctors are experimenting on him with so many different drug cocktails that even a healthy person would’ve gone crazy being on it
esPRsT-lmw8,Kane Mcovy can you tell us a bit more about this test? What is the name of it?
esPRsT-lmw8,"Emily i tooka gene test just to see what medications work with my chemistry, turns out all the ones my psychiatrist had given me were the worst for me. just goes to show how messed up the biz is"
esPRsT-lmw8,"@Kate Anderson that&#39;s not true.  When I took my son to their clinic. They removed him from the toxic,  addictive drugs he was on, and gave him medication based on a real diagnosis. Not only that,  my son is doing so much better in just the 4 months."
esPRsT-lmw8,Because these doctors are in cahoots with the pharma companies.  They want you medicated or dead by suicide.  Our system is broken
esPRsT-lmw8,"Raja Ghani Retrain the mind to deal with only logical thoughts slowly. Start with simple questions, that have a sure answer. The irrational, uncontrollable thinking can be brought under control with training, I have done it"
esPRsT-lmw8,Nicole J  Dear I am in a state of war with myself. The hardest battle in the world is the battle with your own brain. Whenever I want to stop random thoughts they increase even more. I can’t concentrate and focus .
esPRsT-lmw8,"@Raja Ghani Anytime, you have a feeling of something that bothers you, you must ask yourself why and more importantly, does it makes sense? Keep asking yourself the question until you get to a yes, no or I don&#39;t know answer, those are the only honest answers. The other answers are not the true self. This will help you see that the things that bother you are all external, the true self which is really you is perfect. This will help your true self start to show again, and you will start to make decisions with confidence. If you want to know more let me know."
esPRsT-lmw8,Nicole J yes. I want that true self again
esPRsT-lmw8,Do you know your true self is not the same as the depressed self
esPRsT-lmw8,Google Amen clinics
esPRsT-lmw8,That was funny. But I think he also was hinting at the fact that his nephew was a paying taxes instead of consuming them. Either as a prisoner or a patient in a mental hospital.
esPRsT-lmw8,Google AMEN Clinics
esPRsT-lmw8,Google AMEN clinics they have 5 clinics across usa
esPRsT-lmw8,The reason is that brain scans cannot diagnose any disorder.  That&#39;s because levels of brain activity don&#39;t translate one to one with a particular disorder.  What is really happening is that patients come into the office and report symptoms.  these are matched with symptom clusters in the DSM and a diagnosis is given.  Then they get there brain&#39;s scanned.  It really is not telling us as much as he would like us to think.  It is a useful tool in certain cases - but not a method of diagnosis and treatment in itself.
esPRsT-lmw8,"Nadia! My son had similar devastating problems, he’s 9 now and doing well. READ THE NEMECHEK PROTOCOL FOR AUTISM AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISORDERS.

esPRsT-lmw8,"Yea, he sold out. Some of his claims like Alzheimer&#39;s starting way before any behavioral symptoms appear, encapsulated tumors and TBI presenting itself as mental illness are true and detectable through imaging, and even potentially treatable. Developmentally &quot;produced&quot; psychiatric illnesses, no we can&#39;t point out root causes of those illnesses through imaging. Yet."

esPRsT-lmw8,Doing brain scans to search for physical differences/irregularities etc when contemplating a mental illness diagnosis.
esPRsT-lmw8,sally jones on what basis do you  think this guy is brilliant?  He&#39;s a salesman.  He presented no real data that has been peer reviewed and published by his colleagues or the scientific community.   He&#39;s a self proclaimed Maverick.
esPRsT-lmw8,What is he selling? Free information?
esPRsT-lmw8,"Instead of blasting him on this post, why don&#39;t you look up his name and see what books have been published about the very thing he is talking about in this video.

esPRsT-lmw8,@SciFiGirl007 why do you still believe the news to be absolute truth?
esPRsT-lmw8,"Dana deVries well, I wasn&#39;t motivated. It came off like an infomercial to me.  When I hear a motivational speaker I typically come away with a few pearls for improvement."

esPRsT-lmw8,As opposed to what? Psychiatrists making insane amounts of money throwing pill after pill at people? You must be from the pharmaceutical industry.

esPRsT-lmw8,"@zain I have been taking 9 RX&#39;s since 1900 and am 83 come june 19th. that is cause I have used my own Omron BP monitor.  That is the realty I know.  Those whojust take pills as directed do so daily, or twice a day or three times a day. Thar method does not take in account diet changes, water consumption, etc.  As my doctor said to me: &quot;Maevin, be in charge of your life, no matter what a doctor tells you. &quot; So, rearch every pill and have pnly taken generics for free, split pills when I knew i should, and took none when my BP was below 115/anything.  I don&#39;t get dizzy and drive every morning and afternoon .  Exercise is limited because of bad knees and L5/6 spinal disc.  Every pill I take, then is &quot;backed up&quot; with research, and past experience.  My BP pills were twice a day and I have reduced them to 1/2 a pill twice a day."
esPRsT-lmw8,Marvin Purser <br>You’re blatantly ignoring the reality while touting no solutions to back up what you say.
esPRsT-lmw8,@SciFiGirl007 As long as you don&#39;t get hooked into believing you just found a  method to save you from reality!
esPRsT-lmw8,"Sure, if you live in a sterile plastic bubble and have perfect genetics, and don&#39;t get old, etc.  The fact is your body and the environment is much more complex than your simple statement.  Therefore we sometimes need medications... Which I&#39;m thankful we have."

esPRsT-lmw8,"Elilatoni Joseph Lol yeah right, MRIs are way too expensive for that, insurance wouldn’t agree to it.  CT scans are feasible but they’re essentially a machine gun version of X-rays bombarding you with a large dose of radiation by volume."

esPRsT-lmw8,Because this is a big sales pitch. It reminds me of an infomercial. He certainly sells himself well. If you read this as a transcript you will see there is no science in there at all.
esPRsT-lmw8,"Really?  Based on what,,other than your opinion?"
esPRsT-lmw8,unfortunately no. which is why he never specifies what the therapy of traumatic brain injury should be even though he spends almost 20 minutes selling his pitch.

esPRsT-lmw8,"​@Max Meier​/ Actually, yes. Back in the 70s, I watched an episode of the 700 Club that had a woman on who was not a Christian and spoke about how evolution had shaped the brain. But the reason they had her on was because of the incredible story she told.<br><br><br>She had been a school counselor and a small boy was sent to her because he was unable to interact with the other students or teachers and seemed unable to learn to read or write. She said he appeared malnourished so every morning as she tutored him she fed him a big breakfast (this was LONG before school feeding programs) of fresh fruits, eggs, and meat. I think she may have also fed him lunch. Gradually he began to talk and even learn to read.<br><br><br>About six months after this she got a call from a specialist at the local hospital who wanted to know what she had done to him. She told him and he didn&#39;t believe it. He said the boy had had nearly half of his brain removed for seizures and should NOT be able to form new memories! Yet he had remembered her name and telephone number and had given it to the doctor!<br><br><br>Now I know what you&#39;re thinking. There is NO WAY a kid would be admitted to school with that kind of handicap and NOT be resourced immediately. But remember, this was the 60s and NONE of that stuff was even thought of yet. Especially if it was a small rural school! Kids were dropped off and expected to sink or swim. PERIOD.<br><br><br>She said she was brought into the hospital by that doctor and was allowed to set up a post-operative treatment program, based on her theories of nutrition, for his brain surgery patients. Her treatment was LOTS of FRESH vegetables, fruits, AND MEAT. High protein meals with a lot of steak! She would do the shopping herself and then instruct the hospital kitchen how to prepare it so the nutrients weren&#39;t boiled away! She reported lawyers who went back to their practices after their families were told they would not be able to remember the faces or names of their wife and children after their surgeries!<br><br><br>I wish I could remember her name, but I only saw the interview in passing. I was just a sophomore back then, but my memory was pretty good back then."

esPRsT-lmw8,@DaClown Seriously good comment.  You might like the podcast Powers and Principalities with Tim Kelly and Joe Atwell.  I think episode 98 about goes into some of these topics about the gatekeepers of your health.
esPRsT-lmw8,"@Jessica Main with the exception of SPECT, of course."
esPRsT-lmw8,@Jessica Main you are correct except for the &quot;radioactive substances&quot; part.  Gadolinium is used in MRI and it is not radioactive.

esPRsT-lmw8,"It doesn&#39;t say he is snake oil salesman ^^ I agree with some points he makes in this video, the science of psychiatry has fallen behind the other medical sciences. My father in law is a MD, PhD (psychology), and has been a professor in psychiatry (In Denmark), and he is quite critical of a lot of stuff going on in psychiatry, some things he are proud of, but some things are dangerously close of falling into &quot;pseudoscience&quot;."
esPRsT-lmw8,He also uses hand symbols like the occult practioners...
esPRsT-lmw8,Maybe not incorrect? He does sell dietary supplements (aka snake oil) on his website<br><br>&quot;Bright Minds Memory Bundle<br><br>NEW!<br>Our tasty memory powder bundled with 2 bottles of Omega-3 Power for maximum support and savings!&quot;<br><br>only 150 $ LMAO

esPRsT-lmw8,"Because we don&#39;t have different treatments yet. The standard treatment for depression is medication and cognitve therapy.  We have much data to back this up.  If youve been diagnosed with depression and had a spec scan what other therapy besides medications and cognitve/behavioral therapy would you do?   In terms of the  brains ability to heal, itself, we already know the brain has plasticity...this is not new.  I would like to see the data for this guy&#39;s &quot;intensive rehabilitation program&quot; including costs over time, risks and benefits and generalizability.   He shows improved imaging...how does that translate into improved cognitve abilities?"

esPRsT-lmw8,"Is this just the smart program ?<br>I took SMART recovery in rehab.  When I asked  what it was, and told it was CBT, and basically taking a scientific approach to staying sober, coping skills, etc.<br>Where as 12 steps is more faith based.<br>I have my completion certificate. It did teach me how to look at my addiction in blunt,  obvious way, like a Addict does not, bc your delusioned with your problem.

esPRsT-lmw8,75% of brain tissue is composed of cholesterol. but problem is that american diet is very high in refined oils and other trans fats [oxidized cholesterol] which produce rancid brains with short circuits. watch youtubes of Dr. Joel Wallach.
esPRsT-lmw8,@SuperNewf1 which methods did u use 🤔
esPRsT-lmw8,"Makes sense. <br>Make a go at an example<br>Two people talking have different opinion to a topic.<br>A person becomes upset, angry, sarcastic when B person doesn&#39;t agree with A person.<br>To me behavior is action<br>A person behavior of raising voice, words closer to gether, faster heartbeat, etc would be expression of the ego seeking B person validation, acceptance. <br>The problem would be A person has tight grip on words in their conversation only having one meaning, learn self acceptance. <br>If A person is a narcissist than you&#39;ll have better results talking to or with a brick wall.<br>At the moment bestest example I can think of."
esPRsT-lmw8,"we have just to investigate if the problem comes from inside (nature, the &quot;brain configuration&quot;) or outside (the environments, the social rules, the moral rules and so on), or what is the ratio between the two components.

esPRsT-lmw8,"I suffered a brain injury from a railway accident. Could not understand my behaviour. my personality changed. i became reckless, rude, frightened for my life, depressed suicidally, living in fear and did not know what to do. Also disabled for life physically from any labour, in pain  ever since. Robbed of my insurance monies by the company and workers compensation boards and left in poverty without any care. 40 years later I am still alive. My point being a brain can heal. There are various methods."
esPRsT-lmw8,"For example, hyper and hypothyroidism. People act respectively to their deseases."
esPRsT-lmw8,"Maybe you should study Neuroscience instead. It&#39;s a bit closer to this subject, I&#39;d reckon."
esPRsT-lmw8,"This is not true if you actually study this material, conduct research on it, and read the scientific literature. You’d know what you said is not all accurate"
esPRsT-lmw8,"Psychiatry deals with neurotransmitter imbalance, not physical damage to the brain."
esPRsT-lmw8,"I think many people would love just that. But severe anxiety, depression, learning difficulties makes it very hard for some."
esPRsT-lmw8,"People say a lot of things and most medical topics are controversial but what if ... you tried it all and nothing helped, then this did? Each case is different and results vary, not all maladies are curable but some are and if you do nothing there is no hope of that. Being accused is just that, an accusation and not proved and we are all accused of something in our lifetime. Finger pointing is not at all helpful or beneficial, the proof is, that&#39;s why we have courts of law."
esPRsT-lmw8,KenZ Sha Interesting comment. Please elaborate.
esPRsT-lmw8,"The cost is $2700. But that is for  two separate scans and therapist meetings, evaluation with your neurologist and also follow up appointment.  It is covered by some insurances but not all.  If you have ever had an MRI or CT Scan the costs are comparable.   For those that have never had the need, that may sound outrageous.  Some people have traveled down a road of  frustration, tests, exams and more pills than you could imagine, to do exactly what Dr Amen says- To treat a part of the body without even looking at it.<br><br>People should spend more time educating themselves before speaking and there would be a lot less disagreement and bs in the world."

esPRsT-lmw8,Only appears that simple?
esPRsT-lmw8,Yes. voodoo doll.
esPRsT-lmw8,Bob... damaged neurons in the CNS cannot be repaired and Increased blood flow can mean a number of things. He doesn&#39;t even mention what radioisotope he is using and what tracer is coupled with it. The two can affect weather the radio pharmaceutic will go thru the blood brain-barrier. This is not science. This is a scam.
esPRsT-lmw8,"@Marcus Schmück Its complex dummy. Everyones different! Some have physical trauma, others emotional trauma, others have toxins and metals in their brains. I met a guy that literally had gluten in his brain and they misdiagnosed him with skitzophrenia. Others have parasites or gut infections or hormone imbalances. Its unique for everyone , which is why you have to study, find a good practitioner etc etc"
esPRsT-lmw8,"I agree....I was hoping for him to share what was done to improve the brains. While I&#39;m sure he has done plenty of research, he also should share the methods and why they did/didn&#39;t work. It&#39;s not Science unless he can do that. I will be doing more research of course, but something should have also been covered here."
esPRsT-lmw8,"@Gareth Greenslade Agreed. His clinic website also does not explain exactly what treatment for certain conditions entails. For example, traumatic brain injury. My sister-in-law has a TBI and I am constantly looking out for new therapy approaches etc. But you go to his clinic website, click on the TBI section and it just talks about how YOU might have a TBI without even knowing it. Nothing about how exactly the clinic would approach treating a TBI, and all of the treatment options listed separately are pretty much exactly what specialist clinics in the UK are doing already. It&#39;s underwhelming."
esPRsT-lmw8,"truly ALTRUISTIC people give you something actionable, something to DO, not just some vague data, and sugestion to do brain rehabilitation, he just said we&#39;re still primitive in medicine, wow shocking (NO)"

esPRsT-lmw8,"swift73ify  I think he is not turning down the Psychology parts or understanding human behavior, I think he is just adding the physiology to it. Makes sense to me, it should be both"
esPRsT-lmw8,"I understand completely and I am with you on that. I swear I&#39;ve been trying to find that thing called &quot;balance&quot; for most of my life and am still working on it. :) I&#39;ll catch a glimpse every once in a while, but I tend to go to extremes at times."
esPRsT-lmw8,"swift73ify I agree. If you take a look at their website it has clearer information. The scans are a small part. The diagnoses and treatment integrate 4 domains. They are biological, psychological, spiritual, and social. I think the purpose of this talk is to highlight and educate the significance of the scans as a part of overall treatment. The biological area is the only domain that has been left out of traditional psychiatry. I believe he&#39;s just trying to share the usefulness and more effective results when we integrate the physical aspect. Makes perfect sense to me being both a mental health professional and patient myself. Like he mentions, psychiatry is the only branch of medicine that doesn&#39;t look at the organ being treated. When it comes down to it I&#39;m pretty sure the main issue with the practice is the money. Imagine the exorbitant expense to insurance companies and governments if this became a standard practice in psychiatry."
esPRsT-lmw8,"swift73ify Norms are relative to a society or culture and deal with behavior among other things. The brain scans are looking at the physical organ, blood flow, and activity. That&#39;s why he began this work. <br><br>The typical process for psychiatrists to diagnose is based on norms and behavior and how it affects the individual and people around them. Dr. Amen&#39;s point is that this is not accurate.<br><br>We&#39;ve known for a long time what a healthy brain looks like. It has mostly to do with blood flow and activity. The scans are being compared to this healthy standard, not reasonable behavior."
esPRsT-lmw8,swift73ify There are thousands of scans of &quot;healthy&quot; brain function to compare.

It took me 1.5 yrs to taper off klonopin) ( a benzo that didnt even help). watch/read Dr. Peter Breggin. He&#39;s much more interesting than this expensive guy.

esPRsT-lmw8,Hey Cait M. Have you had a chance to follow up on any of the things this doctor has told us about brain rehabilitation?  A friend of mine has a son who was into wrestling... He is now 25.  I wouldn&#39;t doubt there was a lasting brain injury.  He did lose the vision in one eye because of a corneal separation.  Counseling lasts a couple of days.<br>I would appreciate any direction you might have.  Thanks!
esPRsT-lmw8,for a scam artist he has some really good points. psychiatry has done nothing but waste my time because psychiatrists are full of opinions with no real backing. diagnoses are thrown around with no substantial evidence every day. it is BS.
esPRsT-lmw8,He’s a scam artist. Google it
esPRsT-lmw8,"Lizbeth Sosa, thank you for the response.  I got the impression he was referring to controlled changes of some type, as if a regiment of some activity could be healing.  It led me to wonder what his approach to healing is.  In other words, if everything changes the brain then why do these problems persist like they do?  New facts are learned every day, but these brain scans apparently aren&#39;t correcting for random new stimulus.  To me, this means he must be talking about a targeted approach, and I&#39;m curious for more details."
esPRsT-lmw8,Jo B the brain changes everyday. Even when you learn a new fact the brain is physically different than before. <br>The brain changes through all of those that you mentioned above. Anything that you do changes the brain and trains it.

esPRsT-lmw8,"@Mark Ovich yes, trust nature. Until you have a cardiac arrest or a deep veine thrombosis and you desperately need real medication that works 100% of the time and saves your life. You have no clue about medicine. So many people have high blood pressure.

In fact, in terms of &quot;healing&quot; listening to the one that suffer could be more than &quot;mapping&quot; their brains. I would raise the question, if mapping of brain activity can be more helpful in actually helping people who suffer anxiety, depression, and so forth. Because, healing is ultimate goal of doctors.

All for using free WiFi and sitting in a public place and a couple walks up to rob him. New area! All cameras lit but not recording. City owned area . No tracking... he thinks a hit set by local cops for us work against violence and helping our area children with school book bags! Weird and no outside options. He blamed me the Mom but I have never encountered such extreme needs no doctors for his needs. No follow up after surgeries! Cfs drained from ears they patched... sliced I’m up for donating skin! A total might mate for him and me to watch him go thru! He is 29 and should have been through college now and had far better opportunities! We pick and choose whine we help.

esPRsT-lmw8,"Times have changed. You don&#39;t blame physics for the nuclear bomb, do you? Of course, psychiatry caused a lot of suffering but so did every other scientific field. The things they did were horrifying and wrong, i agree. What you neglect however is the progress this field has made. Psychiatrists have helped many more than they have destroyed and are slowly getting better at it. Just like the medical doctors of the past, they are already improving with each passing day,."
esPRsT-lmw8,"There are two types of brain disorders;  neurotransmitter imbalance and physical brain damage. Early stages of neurodegenerative diseases will not show up in any conventional scans. Only until in such a late stage then there are visible changes. In the case of brain tumors and such, yes you can see them. Parasitic and bacterial infections are detected by other means."
esPRsT-lmw8,"I think 85000 scans are credible evidence. Again a CT and MRI have their places, you can check for physical abnormalities with those scans but you can not check function. That is why an oncologist will order a PET in addition to a CT, because you will see the places where activity is going on... that you can not see on a CT. Anyway who cares a bout what you say, who are you? lol"

Brain scans dont grow on trees... as far as this presentation goes ... there is no infomercial here.. the whole talk was pretty much on point.<br>To me it seems like its not like he has some magic treatment for curing brain damage but the talk is about using imaging to solve the Right problem instead of misdiagnosing based on outer symptoms... i will still google his critics out n listen to what they have to say.<br>And the people here looking for magic superfoods that reverse aging in 15 min video.. should try to ask better questions ... thats not how science works."
esPRsT-lmw8,"Forget about weather he is marketing or not. Just use some common sense and simple logic. Tedtalks are seen worldwide, not everybody is gonna personally meet him for a scan. The point being made is simple. Scan the brain to see how its functioning to make sure you treat it right. Whats wrong about it? Seems like a logical thing to do and should be implemented everywhere. Its sad that people get too involved in their deluded conspiracy theory about everything that they miss some common sense and start opposing a good idea to prove their point.

esPRsT-lmw8,"Ultimately, people just don&#39;t need brain scans that fail to provide them with pertinent information. People with ADHD and other issues need access to PET scans that will show them important information about rates of metabolic activity in various areas of their brains (in the case of ADHD, there will be abnormal frontal lobe activity). Plebeians are not privy to treatments that are directed and informed by the most recent advances in neurology/neuroendocrinology and won&#39;t be for another 50 years."

esPRsT-lmw8,Neponset River Wikipedia is not the end-all be-all and information. There is much about Wikipedia that is not telling the absolute facts. Wikipedia like any other media Outlet serves the system. It&#39;s more important about it Wikipedia than the information they tell you is what they are meant to tell you. As if is physician I can tell you first-hand that the system favors those at the top of the pyramid such as big Pharma. And there are lots of treatments that work that are considered &quot;dubious&quot; that work and heal people. Keep believing in the system and see where that takes you.
esPRsT-lmw8,"Yes. One of my colleague&#39;s son&#39;s was completing his residency in neurology at the University of Washington Medical Center. He told her that the department wondered about the justification of SPECT scans as they emitted unnecessarily high radiation. The department suggested that SPECT scans were inappropriate for psychiatric research where a number of SPECTs might be employed to measure the efficacy of diagnosis and progress in treatment.  Furthermore, he told her of casualties by Amen&#39;s clinics where patients had come to the UW Medical Center in medical crisis.  He told her that these patients had been misdiagnosed, should have been tested via a more appropriate imaging technology, and either died or sustained permanent neurological damage. One must wonder why insurance companies have been reluctant to fund SPECT scans performed at the Amen Clinics.  Daniel Amen is, arguably, an intelligent physician, I believe he is still a professor at the University of California, Irvine, a gifted and articulate writer and speaker.  Perhaps the neurological team at the UW is jealous of Amen&#39;s $3 million beach house.  I have yet to hear Amen talk about the risks and possible side effects of SPECT scans.  Experts in the field of neuroimagining suggest that we are not yet at a place where any imaging technology is suitable for more than conscientitious experimentation. That is to say, reliance on imaging is premature with respect to psychiatric diagnosis.  I share Daniel Amen&#39;s hope that one day imaging technologies might really help in diagnostic and treatment decisions, but that does not appear to be where we are at right now.  Incidentally, I was a clinical psychologist for 30 years and saw more than my share of unhelpful outcomes resulting from inappropriate pharmaceutal treatments and incorrect diagnoses."
esPRsT-lmw8,"Well, your comment answered my questions. He seemed very vague on how he treated the cases of scans from depressed individuals. At least Norman doidge somewhat explained how to treat these individuals in his book, this guy was dodgy"

Elon Musk, Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, shall I go on? What did these men do? They thought outside the box of their profession. They changed the way things were done and I assure you their peers probably hated them and whatever else they did. Also alot of the psychiatrists and those in this profession studied about Frued, Jung and whoever else. Those men were real &quot;different&quot; I will call them. So I don&#39;t care if he&#39;s not respected in his field by his colleagues, I want to know what he says and do my own research on him."

esPRsT-lmw8,"and this is because of why? i can explain why, the implications of his findings and scientific facts endanger the whole Mental Health&#39;s way of life, i think he&#39;s right and if he proves it fully the whole system will be dismantaled and redone making all the leading professionals having to find another profession, and you know what, it need to be done. so many people suffered from frontal labotamies done with a pick and hammer, well todays practices are about the same compared to Amen&#39;s new theory, torture, pure torture"
esPRsT-lmw8,Did The SNMMM or AOA  or other researchers comment on the success of traditional psychiatric diagnosis and treatment? And did they define &quot;psychological disorders&quot; and describe how they are assessed? Do they have any response to Dr. Amen&#39;s statement that this is the one field in which the practitioner does not examine the organ they are evaluating?
esPRsT-lmw8,"Really? It&#39;s no wonder the American Psychiatric Association, supported by every &quot;shrink&quot; in general who doesn&#39;t have access to SPECT, condemns it. If not, they would admit flaws in the tradisjonell psychiatric methods of diagnosing, thus admitting doubt in their own profession, witch eventually could cost them their jobs..."
esPRsT-lmw8,"im sure with it being in its infant stages that there are plenty of scared people, specifically the ones that still treat patients with primitive methods, i&#39;m sure that almost all of them are afraid of the unemployment lines because of his discoveries. one man was written off because of a cyst in the brain and he fixed it, how many others are being failed by ancient techniques, this discovery threatens the whole phsyciatric profession, it also reverses an uncomprehendable amount of patients prognosis, the entire phsycological society is afraid of being completely overhauled, think of the implications when everyone realises that their loved one&#39;s have been misdiognosed and severely mistreated because of it, this AMEN disserves a nobel prize for his work."

esPRsT-lmw8,"I think you are not understanding the talk fully. It isn&#39;t about a philosophy but what is scientifically accurate and effective in terms of diagnosing and treating brain health issues. Yes often times there are behavioral problems even personality disorders, that can be corrected by the will of an individual, but there are probably far more cases where individuals brains are not functioning healthily and there aren&#39;t enough words to express how important that is to understand and get help for. When right now our medical culture isn&#39;t even looking at it."
esPRsT-lmw8,"can you give me an example of Committment friends and family made to you. I have been told to support my son the addict, would be to remove them from our home so their only option would be rehab. THis backfired. We are committed to help him with cost of rehab or help, but no longer want him to depend on us for things he should be dong for himself. HE takes all money and buys marijuana, worked a hob for 3 mos, we absorbed all living costs and he spent every earning on marijuana. When he started threatening the home in exchange for money we had to throw him out. Is this the opposite of support.   He will soon go to jail because he will extort or steal to feed his habit,, so jail doesnt help, so are we NOT supporting him by removing means to get his drug?"

esPRsT-lmw8,"there&#39;s truth in what you are saying. the brain is not the mind. We know from near death experiences, a person&#39;s brain activity can be zero, but they are still having experiences and awareness. We are actually more <b>energetic</b> beings, than just physical beings. We have a physical body, emotional body, and mental body. These are our energy bodies, and they are affected through energetic medicines (like homeopathy and PEMF therapies). We really need to address all these levels, and in my understanding, energy therapies are actually the fastest way to change and create the most profound change. Also worth looking into everyone is Brain-wave Optimization. It is a brain balancing therapy using sound...the latest version of neuro-feedback and is changing lives. We need to work both with brains and energetic imbalances. Dr. Amen is very progressive and open-minded, and I enjoy his work, but he is far from enlightened."
esPRsT-lmw8,"Esra Kutlu -<br>l agree.<br>The brain shows a symptom, not the cause."
esPRsT-lmw8,Esra Kutlu you are discussing the brain like a separate entity from the physical being which is why the mental health system in America is a failure. I completely agree with this guy. This might be a bias comment but i actually believe Neuroscience and not Psychiatry  is the only field that truly gives us an indepth understanding of the brain mainly because it not only looks at brain scans but also consider all environmental as well as the whole physical being of a person to see what or which component is causing a brain imbalance.

You Must get brain rehab through the hospital, then more long-term rehab.  I have been through that because of a wreck that almost killed me.  In rehab, you learn how to make the healthier parts of your brain take over the unhealthy parts.  In MRI scans, the parts that are damaged, are very dark.  They no longer would function correctly."

It&#39;s very accessible; the information is all available in his books so most people probably don&#39;t even need scans unless you really can&#39;t figure out from all the literature what&#39;s going on and what you need.  A good example of this is the book on ADD---people can self-identify they type of ADD they have and the appropriate treatment based on years of scientific data.  For those going to Amen Clinic for consultation and scans, there are two brain scans, active and inactive, and hours of other testing which is typical of other psychological and brain health evaluations; and follow up to check results."

You&#39;d need brick and mortar to repair it properly. What is the brain composed of? Mostly fat. But wait aren&#39;t we told to eat a low fat diet? Isn&#39;t fat the cause of stroke and heart disease? Certain fat (Omega 6) causes heart disease not inherently but because almost all of the omega 6 eaten today is ruined by heating and processing. No wonder more people are getting all sorts of mental problems. Slowly but surely the brain and other parts of the body are being replaced with poor material. If the body replaces the processed heated fats with unheated unprocessed omega 6 fat it should logically perform much better. Also include a little more omega 3 but not fish oil. Omega 3 is never heated and processed except for fish oil. If you&#39;re interested in this idea google Brian Peskin.

Today, thousands of heart transplants have been done. The religious said a long time ago, no one can reach gods in the clouds (example: Tower of Babel in the Bible).

esPRsT-lmw8,His stories sound convincing but they are not reproducible unfortunately!
esPRsT-lmw8,The pictures are compelling but the conclusions from this data - as interpreted by Dr. Amen - are too broad. He tells stores based on one or two peoples results. As for the imaging he uses there are ways to get the same data without using dangerous  radiation.
esPRsT-lmw8,You misunderstand. I&#39;m not convinced of his research since I know nothing of it. I only say that the pictures are convincing so far as they seem to show where damage has occured and probably could be useful as a tool in searching for common patterns among patients. It&#39;s a crude way of describing the state of the brain.
esPRsT-lmw8,"You are convinced by the pictures? Do you understand how the data was derived, or what Dr. Amen&#39;s treatment is and how effective it may or may not be compared to other treatments, or how other non-radiation based imaging data might be collected, or the overall reliability of this sort of data?  Its resolution? Its accuracy? Pretty pictures are nice -- but reliable studies must use more than pretty pictures and intuitive explanations to prove correlations. They must be reproducible and based on a larger number of data points. This minimum standard is not met by Dr. Amen&#39;s work."

esPRsT-lmw8,"+lenartc He&#39;s actually talking about SPECT in this presentation, not MRI. It does use radiation so it has similar risks to CT scans, but as others have pointed out, he&#39;s talking about scans of 80,000 different brains, and a single scan would cause a negligible increase in cancer risk, so it&#39;s pretty safe anyway"
esPRsT-lmw8,"+Everett Logan , that&#39;s the number of scans done on 80,000 people."
esPRsT-lmw8,"+Everett Logan Scans are being performed by MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging), what used to be called nuclear imaging (I believe he mentions it by this name). MRI is basically a huge magnet that measures blood flow in the brain. It&#39;s based on the fact that if a part of the brain is active, it&#39;s going to need glucose and oxygen that are delivered by blood, i.e. the higer the brain activity, the higher the blood need.<br>What you were thinking of is a CT/CAT scan. CAT machine makes &#39;sliced&#39; images of brain by using X-rays, which can (depending on exposure) lead to cancer. Approvals for CAT scans are extremely hard to get if it&#39;s for the purpose of a study, and not, say a brain surgery.<br>There are no (known) risks of being scanned by MRI, and it&#39;s mostly just annoyingly loud."

esPRsT-lmw8,"@Paulo H Ah. Though I think it&#39;s unlikely to happen, I must concede your point. The brain is very, very complex, and we don&#39;t even fully understand how it works. Poking around with it&#39;s physiology might have unintended negative consequences. Maybe it&#39;s less experimental and more established than I think. I don&#39;t know either."
esPRsT-lmw8,"yes. hell who knows if these diferences actually can help a person be diferent, or have a better mindset, or have better understand of somenthing, its all about these little diferences, or &quot;horrible traumas that must be fixed so that they can pay taxes&quot;. i needed to put that straw man in there lol"
esPRsT-lmw8,"@Paulo H So your complaint is not that he wishes to fix the symptoms of a disorder but that using his method we might believe a brain is in need of fixing, even though it&#39;s &quot;owner&quot; didn&#39;t have any symptoms? Because he was less focused on &quot;symptom clusters&quot; as he put it, and instead on the physicality of the brain?"
esPRsT-lmw8,"@Ad Astra<br>what i meant to say is that there isn&#39;t a perfect configuration in wich the brain can work, thats what he seemed to imply, in one way or the other. brains that don&#39;t fit this parameter of energy have a phenotypical display of faulty behaviors, hes showing us a link that directly vinculate these different patterns with mistakes, bad behaviors, or as problem that needs to be fixed, the problem i have with this particular video is that he doesn&#39;t present anything else to us, as far as I&#39;m concerned, this evidence is not enough to conclude anything at all about how these different levels of energy (and all its nuances as he explains) affect an individual human, the brain is a complicated organ full of things happening at once, some of said things may even be temporary, so yea, although you consider my argument a straw man, in which i don&#39;t believe you&#39;re wrong due to the approach i used, i still think there needs to be much more understanding before we go around trying to fix things."
esPRsT-lmw8,"@Paulo H And as for the brain changing to fit it&#39;s environment more closely, that is true. However, the most drastic changes we see are in people who were raised in abusive environments and so the brains adapted to better survive in poor environments. You have to remember that the uncontrollable goal of our bodies is to survive, not to thrive or necessarily be healthy and happy, so while our brain can adapt, there are often compensations that later cause issues. While an abused child whose brain adapts to it&#39;s environment has a higher chance of surviving and tolerating his environment, he will also be left with behavioral problems that make life much more and needlessly difficult for him. Ironically, they often spend a large amount of time in therapy later in life trying to fix those very compensations their brain made, and those who don&#39;t have a high risk of continuing a cycle of abuse in their own families."

esPRsT-lmw8,"+Tomasz Kozłowski No, you are not being rational. There is a cause for every effect. There is a reason people rape other people, and I&#39;ll give you a hint, it&#39;s not because they&#39;re possessed, or evil, but because they were once an innocent child who was given the wrong genes and the wrong life. They do not deserve barbaric revenge, they deserve a chance at living the life of a person who can be happy and function normally. If you were them, you would do the same thing. Take it to the extreme; if you were born as Hitler, you would have made the same choices he did. You&#39;re either begging the question that &quot;free will&quot; exists, or are just as mindlessly cruel as the people who commit other atrocities such as the terrible rape of your family member. Hate the circumstances, hate what happened, but the people who do such things were born and primed their whole life to do them just as you were born and primed your whole life to be who you are."

He shook his head and said it wasn&#39;t that simple. Leaving aside the murderous expense, they don&#39;t know if the coloured blobs you see on Spect or Pet scans are a symptom of a given illness or its cause.

esPRsT-lmw8,"@***** Because curing disease is far less profitable than treating disease.  This is the Achilles heal of free market medicine.  It is more profitable to sell someone pills and other treatments for 20 years than it is to cure the condition once and walk away.  Not everything that should be done can be done at a profit, and many things that should not be done CAN be done at a profit.   Not everything that government does is evil, and not everything the free market does is good. "

esPRsT-lmw8,@Eric Taylor <br>You can&#39;t reduce science to measurement. That would make cultural studies impossible. And sometimes you are reduced to subjective experience and thought.<br>There was a time we aquired knowledge (we did baby science). We acquired language.<br>No one will deny that we aquired knowledge. If that is not knowledge then all the scientists better shut up.<br><br>btw.<br>Do you have an idea in what exactly you differ from other people who do not suffer from aspergers?
esPRsT-lmw8,"Just speaking from experience here as an asperger kid myself, the only thing kids with aspergers syndrome really need help with is blending in on the social level. In other words they need to be taught how to socialize from ground up, from body language to staying on topic. We have problems understanding how to express ourselves even if we are fully aware of what it is we want to express.<br><br>Do not accept any medication for autism, it will only make things worse in the long term even if it might work in the short term, let the kid be special, embrace him as a one of a kind."
esPRsT-lmw8,"I believe myself to be on the mild spectrum disorder side and had HUGE benefits from starting yoga at around 17. Brings oxygen to stimulate the brain. My emotional issues got better almost overnight. Started learning in ways I couldn&#39;t before. I felt crazy when I&#39;d go more than two days without practicing. I&#39;m now a yoga teacher because of this, because I understand the immense applications. I&#39;m sure the physical health of the brain is effected by emotions. Yoga is great for clearing the mind enough to be able to watch the thought process without the same kind of usual judgement process(which could cause further damage on its own I believe). My yoga teacher said it&#39;s common for older folks to lose their hearing or sight when they get tired of listening or looking at people/things. Hope this helps"
esPRsT-lmw8,"@Ваня Золотарев There is not a person walking the earth who could not be diagnosed with something along any spectrum of ailments of the mind. I had a very good psychiatrist who taught me this, he said we are all a mix of different aspects of humanity, what counts is how we react to the world, one person with aspergers may very well REACT better to life than another person without aspergers.  Its not the hand you are dealt but how you play it.<br><br>With that in mind I started to react differently to life, I began to change and eventually no longer needed meds or therapy."

Wouldn&#39;t you like to see actual prefrontal lobe damage, together with a diagnoses of symptoms? Like if you had a fractured ankle, you&#39;d probably want to see x-rays taken of the fracture as it heals over time with therapy. This might not be the best analogy, but it&#39;s the gist of what I got from this presentation. <br><br>Amen&#39;s science might be flaky, his methods dubious, but the idea of using brain imaging in mental health treatment and/or therapy doesn&#39;t strike me as bullocks.<br><br>BTW that picture included of Dr. Amen is brilliant.

esPRsT-lmw8,"@Blade56762 Wait, so the average person (&quot;the masses&quot;) irrationally hates the pharmaceutical industry? So then people who had well functioning brains would be in the minority, right? Because irrational hate (which is primitive and impulse driven - &quot;fight or flight&quot; and is defined be activity in a particular part of the brain) would not be sign of a well functioning, healthy brain to me. Should we be drugging them, too? At some point you realize it&#39;s not a disease - it&#39;s a combination of childhood trauma and genes. They are ape-like because they were abused as children, and because society (gov&#39;t via theft, in legion with corporations, public schools, the military industrial complex, big pharma, etc.) bullies them. People with &quot;mental disease&quot; just come from the largest history of childhood abuse and neglect. But the science about childhood trauma and its effect on the brain isn&#39;t the focus of &quot;mental illness&quot; because it would involve holding parents and authority figures in society responsible for the bad actions. Politicians want to flatter people - not hold them accountable morally. This is pretty simple stuff really - if &quot;mental illness&quot; is a thing it exists in the majority of people and cannot be treated successfully via drugs, but only by a change of their deepest values."
esPRsT-lmw8,"@Daniel Thaler It is amazing!

esPRsT-lmw8,"It is not possible in the current legislation. Whatever amount is paid will be balanced at the end of the year. If I pay too much taxes during the year it is returned the next year.

esPRsT-lmw8,"If healing faulty brain function can improve external behaviour, perhaps it could also improve the brain messaging that controls behaviour (i.e. functioning) of the internal organs of the body, thus improving physical health? Could brain imaging be used also for this purpose?"
esPRsT-lmw8,"er. BOLD effect? Not a recognized term. BOLD is a type of imaging used in fMRIs. It measures what, in the 1950&#39;s, psychiatrists thought was behind many psychological disorders, particularly then-called mood disorders. The rest of the neurological world has grown out of this. If you need more clarification, Google it and you&#39;ll jack shit."
esPRsT-lmw8,Do you have sources with comprehensive information on what a BOLD-response (BOLD = Blood Oxygen Level Dependent effect) actually means? I&#39;ve been wondering about the assumption that a higher BOLD-response actually equals to more brain activity
esPRsT-lmw8,"I agree with you on 1) and 2), but that still doesn&#39;t make him wrong in his basic point in that psychiatrists also need to be looking more directly at the organ they are treating. He was using blood flow scans (or something); in the future there will surely be better tools for looking at the brain while it&#39;s active. Whatever conclusions one draws from such observations is, of course, up for discussion ;-) "
esPRsT-lmw8,"why so much anger though? I don&#39;t understand the vitriol in your comment, could you please provide some context; what about the talk irritated you off so much?<br><br>By an large I would think it&#39;s a positive thing that he&#39;s giving people an awareness of the fact that the hidden things are important as well. If someone had a leg amputated he wouldn&#39;t be criticized for not being able to run very fast, but brain trauma leading to psychiatric disorders could very easily sign up that person for a lifetime of judgement for his sub-optimal performance."

esPRsT-lmw8,@Raphael Motta<br><br>Your opinions are open to critical analysis. Just because you have an opinion does not make the idea sacred or correct. <br><br>This was a very logical talk presented in essay format in which the man made a case for looking at a patient&#39;s brain scans while diagnosing behavior disorders. Just because you couldn&#39;t get something out of this doesn&#39;t mean that it is only creating problems. Clearly this idea opens up more precise means of treatment within the psychological community.

But, even in public schools you pay a monthly fee( or not), and that goes from nothing at all, if your family members are poor, (they even give you money to school related matterials), to paying for everything school material wise and a sort of &quot;rent&quot; called in portuguese propinas.<br> Its a balanced system that provides oportunity to all doesnt matter how rich your parents are.

That all has to be paid up before you get anything. <br>Having the government foot the bill, does not magically erase the costs and make it free. Where do governments get money from? Taxes taken from the people and from goods sold to or by the people, borrowing against the economic power of the people, or printing money that is backed by the economic and military power of the nation (in our special case.) In all instances, the people are actually paying the bill, just through a middle man, and disproportionate to the benefit they receive. Rich people will pay more for the education of others than the poor do, and therefor subsidizing education is redistribution of wealth.<br><br>That said, the U.S. does subsidize both K-12 and higher education very extensively. The only reason you wouldn&#39;t be able to get a grant here and have access to several low interest loans is if you&#39;re well-off enough to afford it in the first place.<br><br>Even though the U.S. has been following this model of &quot;free education&quot; for years, it does so with its own top-down curriculum designation and the result is declining outcomes and standards. Our system has only gotten worse as we&#39;ve made it more and more public. Private school students outperform public school students. Hell, even home school students, which are largely raised and taught by religious fundamentalists who don&#39;t know much of anything, STILL outperform public school. That&#39;s saying something.<br><br><br>By the way, not every &quot;civilized&quot; nation provides free education to everyone. Japan, for example, requires testing and good performance prior to granting access for higher education. What is the result? Despite being a relatively tiny country with a small population, they are one of the world&#39;s most prominent economic powerhouses and they have no shortage in hard science applicants like we do here. Sure, you can go to college in these other countries (and the U.S.), and you can get your free liberal arts degree... and then you can throw that useless shit in the garbage and go work for mcdonalds."

What we are is spirit and unique, while ministering to us spiritually we are not encouraged to express any religious differences and the main goal is never to say anything that will disturb the person we&#39;re talking to especially those who are treating us!  "
esPRsT-lmw8,@***** yea I can see how he helped you. Notice how I mentioned exceptions though? Although you don´t seem to be one of them. 
esPRsT-lmw8,@***** Are you sure as you sound pretty angry...a symptom of depression..you know sadness and anger cycle.
esPRsT-lmw8,"@*****<br>The same goes for a friend of mine, who suffered from depression."
esPRsT-lmw8,now I understand...
esPRsT-lmw8,"In 2013 a session of two SPECT scans was reported to cost $3,500 (£2,225).[9] Amen claims to have scanned 50,000 people at an estimated cost of $170 million.[10] The services available are not normally covered by insurance companies and therefore patients must pay for their own treatment.[11]"
esPRsT-lmw8,"What you didn&#39;t understand is that childhood trauma affects how we think, which affects behavior, which affects blood flow to the brain. So the link, while not direct, is there."
esPRsT-lmw8,meh just stating what can happen on two different branches of the same tree.  If it happens and we&#39;re controlled then it&#39;s our own fault but even if that does happen there will always be a group of individuals trying to liberate the people.  Just as there will never be a world of peace there will never be a world of complete control.  Only chaos exists in our world  and has since the dawn on time.  
esPRsT-lmw8,"@Downthehollow Nice tin foil hat, you&#39;ve there."
esPRsT-lmw8,"Well, you&#39;re right. In the meantime, however, one can still learn about the real cause for disease, right? German New Medicine also makes clear why children these days are more an more suspect to allergies, especially of the skin and the lungs. A good start would be to not let anybody take your baby away, shortly after it is born (skin is related to separation from the mother, which in nature means disaster for a young born). We love to think we&#39;ve out-grown the old bio-logical &#39;emergency programs&#39; of our bodies, but that&#39;s not so at all..."
esPRsT-lmw8,but that&#39;s not war. a war is when two sides are fighting.  In this &quot;war&quot; as you call it.  one side is the victim to the other&#39;s power....to start a war...we need a revolution.  And even though i hate the french...the people of france know when they don&#39;t like something and then do everything in their power to change it.  Or at least to my knowledge.  my knowledge may be outdated though.
esPRsT-lmw8,"That war is already going on, or what would you call it when an elite group can dictate people which health therapies they&#39;re allowed to use (even after official medicine gave up on them) and which ones not? Isn&#39;t it war when they can force parents to stand by while they pour highly toxic chemo into their young childrens bodies and take away their rights as parents if they resist to this idiotic and dangerous &#39;medical treatment&#39;? There&#39;s a real cure for disease out there, called German New Medicine (don&#39;t get put off by the &#39;German&#39; part of the name), of which the inventor was a doctor, &#39;till he refused to back off, after which he has been taken away is license, got hunted and thrown in jail a few times. Check it out and if you get it, I promise it will change your life like it did mine."
esPRsT-lmw8,"@Tiwaking Tiwaking Think he means &#39;read&#39; as in past tense, ie: he just read it, as opposed to a request."
esPRsT-lmw8,Just read the paper he mentioned.
esPRsT-lmw8,"@Koseiku Um, I think the way his nephews life is transformed is illustrative of this. It&#39;s a while since I watched this, but I seem to remember his nephew was being violent, and then it turned out he had an abscess, which once removed, revealed a nice lad."
esPRsT-lmw8,"Indeed. This speech was interesting to listen to since the man is pretty charismatic, but..there is no conclusion to be honest. The statement is basically &quot;a life can be changed when the brain is changed&quot;. How, when and where this happens remains unclear."

esPRsT-lmw8,"this is a paragraph of an article about SPECT and psychiatric diagnosis: &quot;vIn 2005 the American Psychiatric Association Council on Children, Adolescents, and Their Families issued a white paper that concluded, “At the present time, the available evidence does not support the use brain imaging for clinical diagnosis or treatment of psychiatric disorders in children and adolescents” (APACCA, 2005). In a review of one of Amen’s popular books, appearing in the American Journal of Psychiatry, Leuchter (2009) writes, “it is not clear how the SPECT image provides reliable information that informs clinical decisions… There is also no evidence presented to justify exposing patients to the radiation of a SPECT scan and to support the considerable expense to patients, families and their insurers….” It was recently reported that the Brain Imaging Council of the Society of Nuclear Medicine proposed a test of Amen’s methods by asking him to interpret a set of blinded SPECT scans, but the offer was declined.&quot; <br><br>the link is <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3597411/"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3597411/</a> "
esPRsT-lmw8,"Agreed, and the fact that he simply says &quot;Drug abuse&quot; without further mentioning which drugs were abused in that patient clearly indicates a flawed and irrational mindset. Was it caffeine that caused the brain damage? Alcohol? Heroin? - He simply says &quot;Drugs&quot; causes brain damage.<br>To draw the conclusion that all drugs causes brain damages because he&#39;s seen brain damage in &quot;drug abusing patients&quot; is extremely irrational."
esPRsT-lmw8,I have to agree there was nothing solid in anything he said in this talk.
esPRsT-lmw8,"Yup, agree, dude is annoying."

esPRsT-lmw8,"Just because I am bored and suffer from insomnia tonight.<br><br>This is not a spongiform encephalopathy - vide prion diseases. Most importantly - if you understand what happens with a mind that is addicted to a drug you understand why some parts of the brain does not light up in the scan. This most likely is heroin, but I bet that other drugs could cause similar pattern (meth, maybe even coke). You probably worry about thc or lsd, these are actually less likely to develop into a severe addiction like this and are even on clinical trials to cure some mental illnesses. What is shown there is a severe addiction, you pursue only the drug so if social life disappears - part of the frontal lobe disappears and so on. This is not measure of structural change, spect is a measure of activity. This is a simplification I made for you. The truth is that functional changes overlap with organic, structural changes and after a while you are becoming simply brain dead. "
esPRsT-lmw8,"@***** And what&#39;s so wrong with earning a money with what you dedicated your life to? Or do you suggest, that it&#39;s absolutely immoral to charge money from people, who are you helping to overcome their direst health problems? Hmm...Then we should probably say no to the hospitals, doctors and drug factories. How dare they earn money on us? They must help us for free."
esPRsT-lmw8,"@AutAth One of the fundamental functions of every living organism is self replication/regeneration. Every biological living tissue can be grown, healed and so on. Brain cells are no exception to it. This time let&#39;s just localize on humans. Human body is an excellent (one might say miraculous) machine. It&#39;s almost fully automotive. It does everything by itself. All you gotta do is just give it some spare parts and spend some time or strengthening and improvement. Just as any mechanic can&#39;t fix the mechanism, if he has no spare parts - human body can&#39;t repair it&#39;s tissues, if there are no fundamental building blocks to replace the damaged parts with. Only thing is, that some parts of the human body are more easily repairable than others. It&#39;s partly because of the complexity of the structure and the tissue. And partly because of the specific dietary requirements. Normal, every day diet is full (at least it&#39;s supposed to be) of basic proteins, minerals and vitamins. As well as few fats. It&#39;s good for repairing damaged skin, or flesh, or bone tissue. But inner organ regeneration takes &quot;just a bit more&quot;, than tuna salad and steak with mashed potatoes. <br><br>So here we go. It&#39;s not a rocket science. It&#39;s just a basic understanding of human anatomy and body functions. As well as some insight into the nutritionism. If human body can grow from it&#39;s body parts from a single cell - then sure as hell it can replace few thousand of cells out of millions. And yes, babies have active stem cells, which adapt very easily and can morph into any type of tissue needed. But that is a secondary point here. The main point is - full functioning human body can be grown from almost nothing with the help of the necessary building blocks. And that includes brain and eye cells (but of course that process is dulled by poor overall health condition, poor environmental conditions and slowed down regeneration rate, which stems from those two problems)."

He&#39;s egotistical. Which is the problem with anyone who is criticizing Dr. Amen&#39;s methods without knowing for sure. Instead of criticizing, we should be looking to see what is working, why, and how well. That&#39;s how we&#39;ll get an answer. Not from Mr. QuackWatch."
esPRsT-lmw8,"@phoebe anne He never misrepresents that. He never claimed he could reverse anything. He specifically mentioned how much an improvement he made. And btw, those improvements are ten times better than what traditional medicine is able to do. My grandmother is in a nursing home because of dementia. The rest of her is 100% healthy. This could be life changing for her. In a few months, she has gone from living alone to being almost someone else with little normal brain activity. Most of hers is now demented. Dr. Amen is very transparent and he truly cares. Also, you need to choose between the varying opinions out there, even though they are contradictory. To not choose is still a choice. And one that can have awful consequences."
esPRsT-lmw8,"I really don&#39;t know how he reverse dementia. But if he is scanning the brain, at least he is viewing, or looking for a particular problem. Most medical doctors never look at the brain, so I know they will never discover anything. For next 50 years they will keep saying there is no cure. The universe doesn&#39;t work like that. There is a cure for everything, we just haven&#39;t tap into the frequency of thought yet. And when someone like Dr. A. comes along doing things out of the box, he is tapping into that frequency."

esPRsT-lmw8,"I think several items he presents are valid - the scans are necessary for psychiatric treatment.  It&#39;s like doing a heart scan and a cardiologist saying - gee, you must have a cholesterol problem, lets treat that with X &amp; Y.   I&#39;ve read a couple of his books that condone nutrition and exercise and adequate sleep, etc.  It&#39;s basic common sense where he explains the parts of the brain and what a person can do to optimize their brain/body health.  I don&#39;t think I would go to his clinic but his message (not the delivery) is something I think is definitely worthy of further examination."
esPRsT-lmw8,"As part of my point, you can&#39;t even get psychiatrists to do serious lab work on the brain and nervous system.  To really get a good lab study of the brain you would need to study spinal fluid.  You would have to do a spinal tap to get some spinal fluid to study.  Never heard of a spinal tap done for diagnostic purposes for a person with a diagnosis of mental illness. <br><br>But neurologists and neurosurgeons do spinal taps all the time for suspected brain injuries and other neurologic lesions and diseases."

esPRsT-lmw8,"@Benjamin Island What lawsuits?  As a retired personal injury attorney of 35 years, I can tell you that medical malpractice lawsuits are few and far between.  Medical malpractice suits are primarily insurance propaganda. <br><br>Medical malpractice lawsuits are the second most expensive personal injury lawsuits to handle, second only to products liability cases, and they are the hardest to win because finding an expert who will testify is extremely difficult and expensive.  In 35 years, I took maybe five or six, despite the fact that I had more calls about medical malpractice than even auto accidents or worker&#39;s compensation.  And I ended up regretting taking two of those.  Live and learn.   Even apparent slam dunks turn out to be anything but. <br><br>But the point is, they are rare.  Very few lawyers want to handle them.  But insurance companies make a killing off of medical malpractice premiums because the doctors and legislatures are clueless as to what the facts are about them."
esPRsT-lmw8,"I have no way of knowing if your story or your interpretation of it is correct, however our medical system would be far more just if doctors did not treat defensively in response to lawsuits from misinformed patients who believe that less treatment is equal to neglecting their well being.

esPRsT-lmw8,"so yes kept reading down thru comments and got to someone else who&#39;d said this sounds so great and wanted to know why anyone woulda been against the scans as amen had said they were...so another had posted a comment with a link to an article disputing him/his findings...sorry i&#39;m not really a &quot;computer person&quot; and your link says <a href=""http://salon.com"">salon.com</a>? and so figured this had nothing to really do with science is all, sounded like it could be some dating site or something? but did want to know why he might be a fraud but didn&#39;t want to get a virus or anything...and so i have read about the consensus from the scientific community and the reasons they&#39;re disputing it etc....which i agree and disagree with some of their reasons too which posting on the other comment....so the best info i&#39;ve found so far (after reading about spect and mri (and others) which BOTH have safety issues associated with them and then trying to compare? because they are useful for different things and some things that need scanned are better with one or the other? and even tho some are saying that the radiation is bad others are saying it&#39;s the same amount you&#39;d get in 1 years exposure(from the mayo clinic&#39;s site) which isn&#39;t harmful for most. then for the mri they&#39;re saying there is evidence of dna damage but aren&#39;t sure if it&#39;s linked to any cancers? there&#39;s no long term study for it? so for this topic the best info i&#39;ve come across so far is the &quot;history of neuroimaging&quot; in wiki-&quot;The first neuroimaging technique ever is the so-called ‘human circulation balance’ invented by Angelo Mosso [1] in the 1880s and able to non-invasively measure the redistribution of blood during emotional and intellectual activity.[2] Then, in the early 1900s, a technique called pneumoencephalography was set. This process involved draining the cerebrospinal fluid from around the brain and replacing it with air, altering the relative density of the brain and its surroundings, to cause it to show up better on an x-ray, and it was considered to be incredibly unsafe for patients (Beaumont 8). A form of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) were developed in the 1970s and 1980s.[3] The new MRI and CT technologies were considerably less harmful and are explained in greater detail below. Next came SPECT and PET scans, which allowed scientists to map brain function because, unlike MRI and CT, these scans could create more than just static images of the brain&#39;s structure. Learning from MRI, PET and SPECT scanning, scientists were able to develop functional MRI (fMRI) with abilities that opened the door to direct observation of cognitive activities&quot; so it seems as tho the &quot;best&quot; must be fMRI but it&#39;s just the &quot;most popular&quot; not even the &quot;best&quot; when you start reading down thru the rest of the wiki page...so they&#39;ve been combining different scans in order to get a better/more complete picture. then on top of that the computer technology is getting better at being able to compile and show the images. then they point out that now it seems that most innovators time is being spent on making sense of the data that we already have instead of inventing new imaging techniques? then there is TMS, &quot;In TMS, a coil is held near a person&#39;s head to generate magnetic field impulses that stimulate underlying brain cells to make someone perform a specific action. Using this in combination with MRI, the researcher can generate maps of the brain performing very specific functions. Instead of asking a patient to tap his or her finger, the TMS coil can simply &quot;tell&quot; his or her brain to tap his or her finger. This eliminates many of the false positives received from traditional MRI and fMRI testing. The images received from this technology are slightly different from the typical MRI results, and they can be used to map any subject&#39;s brain by monitoring up to 120 different stimulations. This technology has been used to map both motor processes and visual processes (Potts link at bottom of TMS). In addition to fMRI, the activation of TMS can be measured using electroencephalography (EEG) or near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS).&quot; which to me sounds like it would have ethical ramifications to deal with? also they talk about NMR(which is where MRI came from) and how they revamped it and now &quot;Separating the encoding and detection allows researchers to gain data about chemical, physical, and biological processes that they have been unable to gain until now. The end result allows researchers to map things as big as geological core samples or as small as single cells.&quot; which sounds extremely detailed to me!! So i feel that yes amen&#39;s theory of the need for psychiatrists to &quot;see&quot; the patients brains in order to help with diagnosing and treating makes sense...but how they&#39;re looking at the brains and interpreting the data and then making sure the treatments are effective is going to take a while :-/ seems like this is what everyone is working towards? too bad they couldn&#39;t &quot;get along and work together&quot;! I&#39;m sure that if they combined ALL the different scans/knowledge that they have, even on the worldwide level, that it would be way more helpful in the long run!! but it seems as tho even tho he says that he(his colleagues) have data/interpreted 83,000 scans....well i couldn&#39;t find any-other numbers that big? so maybe they do have a better idea of what the certain scans should look like or if they do look different what those differences usually correspond to? idk just because someone references one other study that used mri instead but fails to mention that in the study they only looked at 2,000 not 83,000 scans or how some other researcher at some college says that the spect scans don&#39;t make sense to him and relates them to a palm reader? doesn&#39;t prove that the scans are useless or &quot;unreadable&quot;? for everyone? idk about you but to me the images of the &quot;normal&quot; brains and the ones with Alzheimer seemed very different? but whether he could prove the one with the holes were &quot;always&quot; going to be Alzheimer and that no &quot;normal&quot; person would ever have an image like that? idk what do you think? i think that the one with holes would indicate something was wrong but what was wrong would be more difficult to tell 100% of the time? but after 83,000 examples to refer to might make it a bit easier? idk?...in psychiatry and mental/emotional illnesses in general it&#39;s my observation that one treatment may work for one person with depression but not the next, and that&#39;s the same across all the diseases and injuries, sure there are some treatments that seem to work better for the majority but none covers/cures any certain brain disease that i&#39;ve found?! so it&#39;s no surprise to me that amen&#39;s treatments have helped some people but not all since it&#39;s that way with EVERY treatment type! is the only thing that i can conclude after all this?"
esPRsT-lmw8,"@Meloni Lewis An article written by the Associate Chief of the Department of Neurosciences is not malware. I did not say the link was absolute proof of Amen&#39;s fraudulence, but merely offered a breadcrumb for anyone with the curiosity and freedom of thought to question this vague, anecdotal &quot;breakthrough&quot;.<br><br>I find it curious that your suspicion is directed at me, instead of at the man who claims he can use SPECT scans to detect and prevent Alzheimer&#39;s Disease (while making a tidy profit off it), when almost the entirety of the scientific community is in consensus that his methods are completely ineffective.

esPRsT-lmw8,"Thanks for posting this. I&#39;m normally skeptic, but this has taught me to be even more skeptic than before.

esPRsT-lmw8,"@MrKimchiNinja Doesnt he say anything? Have we watched the same video? He criticized how an entire class of health professionals use arcaic/ineffective methods of diagnosis, leading to inaccurate treatment. He talked about how society basically utilizes the same method, judging people by their aberrant behavior without trying to know (and possibly treat) the real cause of it. He alerted us to the possible danger of people that practices brain-damaging activities. And finally he mentioned that with brain rehabilitation programs, instead of medicine throw in the dark, you could really treat the source, not the symptons. That anyone can change their own brain. He even showed an scientific article for reversing brain damage. Seems plenty for 15 min and I really doubt that it comprises his 23 years of research in the area.<br>I doubt nutrition alone can stop/reverse dementia, depression, etc. But if you have proof otherwise then go save millions of lives dude =D "
esPRsT-lmw8,Maybe it&#39;s because he&#39;s not a nutritionist lol Why would a psychiatrist explaining lessons from brain scan talk about nutrition in the first place? XD
esPRsT-lmw8,"@MrKimchiNinja<br>Did you not pay attention to anything he said or did you not understand it? I&#39;m not trying to be rude but you&#39;ve misunderstood what he said in this video, let me explain. Dr. Amen was promoting brain scanning for people who show signs of brain disorder or dysfunction ie, ADHD, dementia, or physical damage. He briefly mentions that today we don&#39;t scan people who show these signs, we simply send them to a psychiatrist who would evaluate them then prescribe medication based on that evaluation. He believes we should scan and then give treatment based on the collective data obtained from previous similar brain scans. He never says psychologists don&#39;t know what their doing he just says they don&#39;t have the equipment to give proper reliable diagnosis."

esPRsT-lmw8,"@Doriesep6622 Thx Dorie. I have blood tests taken regularly and my doctor has cut me down from 20mg to 7.5mg a day throughout the years. If I take less than the blood tests recommend I will probably start hearing voices again. I still have a tiny bit of voices left even with medication and that suggests all voices will come back if I totally stop with medication. Also the ruining of my health feels kind of permanent now. I also have my case running, that I want to prove I indeed were healthy when they first forced me to take medication. I will probably be taken more serious if I am not hearing voices when that is going on. But after that I am considering stopping with medicine. It will requiere a special permission to not take medicine while hearing voices. But I heard it has been given before in Denmark."

esPRsT-lmw8,"3 years ago, my own mother caught her (at the time, stage 2) breast cancer via mammogram and it saved her the agony of chemotherapy and worse, death.   I can&#39;t even take your comment seriously!"
esPRsT-lmw8,"The studies all prove that, No, Mamagrams actually increase the number of false positives and do nothing to give early warning to cancers&#39;s that will be &quot;lived through&quot;.  But don&#39;t worry you can continue to irradiate yourself at the through the Mamography lobby efforts.  The only people I&#39;ve ever known who were warned of a &quot;shadow&quot; were false positives.  Its all a giant scam for another private profit group.  But go ahead listen to the men who get paid to give you your mamogram they have no reason to stop their personal gravy train...and  please don&#39;t think I&#39;m thinking I&#39;m better than them...We are all subject to various seductions because they serve our needs somewhere...When people go to their mamogram they are participating in a ritual that we value our unique vulnerability of our womanhood...and other such almost spiritual rituals.  Meeting smart caring medical people also validates their good intentions...We do lots of rituals that serve in conscious and unconscious ways. <br><br>Personally I&#39;d like our instrumentation to be able to take biopsies that actually identify all the cell not of our DNA that do live in our bodies and when their populations change in various ways create disease weak and fatal.  We currently do not even try to make such tests part of regular exams...we barbarically radiate and guess what that shadow is or we MRI and at least see variations in interior structures but still no dynamic look at the changes in our internal cellular communities.  For perspective we are 10trillion cells with our DNA...we also have within us 100 Trillion other cells....these have been determined in research labs...but even though such labs are public ally<br> funded they will never serve to make your therapy more effective because they are given to private corporations who must create profit...now if you are in the ax buisness you are not going to see a lot of tree farms. "
esPRsT-lmw8,"@Laura Prezio It makes sense that mammograms would not diminish the incidence of breast cancer, yet they likely extend life span and decrease the number of deaths as result of breast cancer. Would you agree?"
esPRsT-lmw8,"What brain scans do is, often times, help people break free from denial that their unhealthy habits are affecting their brains.  Also, they help SPECT experts and psychiatrists target more effective treatment options for psychiatric issues... ones that address the area of the brain where imbalance is biologically occurring (rather than guessing)."
esPRsT-lmw8,@Jalini Alias While we can&#39;t say that feeling better always occurs with brain scans...its worth considering...We currently have millions of data that say Mamograms do not in any way diminish incidence of breast cancer and we still do them...Why not consider corollaries with brain scans. 
esPRsT-lmw8,"@Nouseeker okay... double blind studies: the kind of studies that intentionally consign HALF of the population being studied to their fates regardless of how horrible that is? is THAT the one you mean? bear in mind we&#39;re talking mental illnesses that in some cases can result in mass murder / suicide / other types of violence and in other cases institutionalization. are positive results not enough?<br>btw, I have physically experienced the positive effects of wholistic medicine so unless you&#39;ve been ill and have been told by doctors that they&#39;ve done everything and you&#39;re still not okay, then out of desperation you turn to other means of cure and you suddenly do get better, I don&#39;t think you should sneer on it too much.  Life has a way of turning things around on you ;)"
esPRsT-lmw8,"@Nouseeker Hello again, it&#39;s clear that you have your own polarized opinions and judgments, and that you have not put time or effort into investigating the truth of your statement &quot;there is no scientific proof . . . to see whether this has any clinical relevance,&quot; making any sort of interaction with you a lost cause.  Perhaps start with Google Scholar - and of course holistic and alternative methods have very, very high success rates, however this is lost on those who choose to walk through life with blinders. "
esPRsT-lmw8,"@Linda Driscoll Powers you do not understand how science works; theres is no scientific proof, no double blind studies to see whether this has any clinical relevance; furthermore, anyone who knows what a SPECT scan is or how the brains works, can realize this is silly; he is selling a product; by the way, holistic or alternative methods are mostly hogwash; if you cant prove something scientifically it simply doesnt exist, magic doesnt exist (in this day and age we live in, thing that are on the fringe are there for a reason)"
esPRsT-lmw8,"@Nouseeker Quackwatch means nothing - The site is focused on discrediting anyone using holistic or alternative methods. Again, this is ONE person&#39;s OPINION…  and it&#39;s extremely biased toward conventional medicine.  It&#39;s high time that psychiatry evolved alongside modern technology, even it that means some &quot;uncomfortable change&quot; for the docs who are comfy on their couches. "
esPRsT-lmw8,@sugarfuut google &quot;A Skeptical View of SPECT Scans and Dr. Daniel Amen&quot;; theres a good article by another medical doctor about this guy on the the web site called quackwatch; its pretty extensive
esPRsT-lmw8,"I agree with your opening statement regarding the people currently in prison, it is nothing less than a travesty! But, I find everything Dr. Amens says to make sense. Just as the ill state of any organ will dramatically affect the body, the brain plays an obvious and crucial role in one&#39;s behavior. An ill brain will manifest in one&#39;s behavior."
esPRsT-lmw8,"Yeah, I think it would be best for you if you DID buy into it. Just saying."
esPRsT-lmw8,Have you truly researched the claim that you are making regarding lack of studies? Google Scholar is a great place to begin.. 
esPRsT-lmw8,"a lot of new ideas get on quackwatch just because they&#39;re new.  a majority agreeing that something is wrong doesn&#39;t make it wrong even if they&#39;ve got a bunch of letters behind their names, Galileo comes to mind rather strongly.<br>I disagree with the idea of double blind studies for terminal illnesses that presently have no cure, such as cancer -- you&#39;re consigning half the population being studied to ZERO HOPE.  Also, you might want to consider that if a cure works for 50% of the people and doesn&#39;t work on the other 50%, what justifies that to NOT be considered when the alternative is 100% incurable?"
esPRsT-lmw8,"Ill say it again: Quackwatch means nothing - At his clinics, diagnosis are NOT made using scans alone… that would be ridiculous.  This claim is due to someone not researching his methods and making opinions based on limited information. The Quackwatch site is focused on discrediting anyone using holistic or alternative methods. This is ONE person&#39;s OPINION…  and it&#39;s extremely biased toward conventional medicine.  It&#39;s high time that psychiatry evolved alongside modern technology, even it that means some &quot;uncomfortable change&quot; for the docs who are comfy on their couches."
esPRsT-lmw8,"I know nothing of Daniel Amen, but the possibility of &quot;rewiring&quot;/&quot;fixing&quot; the brain has been demonstrated well at the Arrowsmith School (<a href=""http://www.arrowsmithschool.org/"">www.arrowsmithschool.org/</a>‎) in Toronto.  While they do not use scans, they do recognize when and how the brain is malfunctioning and use many innovative techniques to train the brain to do that which it has been unable to do.  Children who attend this program move leaps and bounds through the academic levels thanks to their training."
esPRsT-lmw8,"You can&#39;t compare IQ with mental illness because IQ is not a &quot;thing&quot;, it is a tool for assessing what is currently considered to be intelligence by experts. Research on relationships between brain imaging and IQ in healthy brains have been mostly inconclusive to this day, one exception to this is the one I mentioned in my previous comment.<br>As for mental illness, dr. Amen did say that he could diagnose some of them with brain imaging, which isn&#39;t really surprising since they are an actual &quot;thing&quot;.<br>The correlations between IQ and mental illness are unclear to this day with some studies saying there is no relation at all and others claiming that diseases like schizophrenia or bipolar disorders are linked to higher IQ."
esPRsT-lmw8,Yes.  Someone like Einstein may have high brain activity in certain areas of the brain.  Can you tell the difference between IQ and mental illness?
esPRsT-lmw8,"I have answers to some of your question. But first of all, how would you define &quot;brilliant&quot; or &quot;mentally disturbed&quot;? Are you talking about IQ tests, moral standards, wisdom?<br>People with high IQ actually have lower activity than people with lower IQ in their pre-frontal cortex when solving problems, probably because they need less resources than less &quot;intelligent&quot; people to solve the same problems. However, as you increase the difficulty of said problems, their pre-frontal cortex becomes highly activated because they need to focus more to solve it."
esPRsT-lmw8,"Hello, nutritional, exercise, and various behavioral and lifestyle adjustments are in fact the first line of treatment that he and his colleagues use at the clinics (and are written about extensively in his books).  Every person who visits a clinic also gets a full blood workup and labs to measure the crucial biological elements that influence brain health. He is way ahead of his time!"
esPRsT-lmw8,Very informative-thank you for posting!
esPRsT-lmw8,"@John Mader The opinions don&#39;t mean anything… the patient results do. Many of the great innovators who brought advances to the modern world, such as Nikola Tesla just to name one, were attacked and &quot;discredited&quot; in their day… Why?

OtngSHtz-cc,"KonstantinGeist<br>And that all makes sense when you think about our survival. Babies and children like toddlers are extremely vulnerable in nature. As a result it would make sense that they would be fairly hard coded to follow adult instructions since not doing so may very well lead to them dying. Chimps on the other hand are far more hardy against the dangers of the wild at a younger age. Babies can&#39;t even hold up their heads for months, can&#39;t walk for roughly 1-2 years, can barely communicate before they&#39;re 2, barely capable of feeding themselves by 1, and for the most part wouldn&#39;t be able to defend themselves from a  squirrel before they 1.5-2 years old. If everyone over 4 vanished we would most likely go extinct withing a couple of weeks."

OtngSHtz-cc,Lol aw.
OtngSHtz-cc,@Pipil Chocolate So you&#39;re saying that they should search this one out of probably 20+ researches online instead of just asking.... That would be just stupid for something that really doesn&#39;t matter.
OtngSHtz-cc,So basically<br>A: The children in the original study were <b>also</b> told what to do<br>and<br>B: This video is fake and therefore a waste of time
OtngSHtz-cc,"@Denise Jarry Oh, hey, our names are only two letters off! That&#39;s neat! :)"
OtngSHtz-cc,"@David S When replying in a thread like this, it&#39;s helpful to tag the person you are replying to, as otherwise its very hard to know who you are adressing."
OtngSHtz-cc,"I&#39;m assuming they&#39;re just lifting phrases from scientific texts where they&#39;re rigorous with their language, or that&#39;s how they&#39;re used to speaking from writing said texts. They&#39;re saying not all baby animals behave or develop this way, it&#39;s just what&#39;s observed in baby humans."
OtngSHtz-cc,"+wheedler  What point are you trying to make? If anything you are proving my reasoning, because of course we can clearly see that it&#39;s a child or a baby; my wonderment is to the reason why they are adding &#39;human&#39; to it, when child or baby seems more normal.<br>However I think you are missing my angle. What I am saying is that I find it strange to hear it said as baby human, when the word child or baby would suffice on it&#39;s own. How often do you hear someone say baby human? Maybe you hear it often, but for me it&#39;s very foreign, and because of that I (personally) cannot help but laugh at these videos. I&#39;m not saying it takes away from the experiment, just I find it funny and odd."
OtngSHtz-cc,"We can clearly see it&#39;s a child/baby, too."
OtngSHtz-cc,"It’s broken, better slurp it"
OtngSHtz-cc,Marley you&#39;re so cute
OtngSHtz-cc,"stellar they actually really do, the adults here are just pretending they don&#39;t for the sake of making themselves feel smart in a video lol"
OtngSHtz-cc,"And looking up the experiment, it shows that they did only encouraged a portion of children and the others were not encouraged. Both groups did the exact same thing as each other when it came to the toy size objects"
OtngSHtz-cc,"Tiffa Talks actually this video doesn’t mention it but in the experiment they had 2 groups. One group was encouraged, the other wasn’t. Both groups actually did the same thing to the toy scale objects. They both try to use it as a normal kid scale object. So this experiment is valid, its just the video left out a key detail."
OtngSHtz-cc,Exactly. A six year old would at least point out that the car is too small to fit.<br>The point is that the 2 year olds don&#39;t seem to relate to the size as self obviously being too small
OtngSHtz-cc,xyon172 <br>Totally agree. Maybe this is the reason behind a faulty educative system. Taking conclusions of faulty experiments only leads to wrong systems of education.
OtngSHtz-cc,"The study is presented and commented on as relating to the child&#39;s relation to scale, not how the child responds to outside influence over their actions.This is supposed to be science.  You set up an experiment to test your theory or to gather data from as untainted a source as possible.  You NEVER go in to an experiment, watch the subject for a few minutes and then start prompting them to interact the way you want them too.If the study was, how susceptible are children of this age to outside influence or pier pressure then this is a great study.  BUT IT IS NOT!"
OtngSHtz-cc,"I remember when I was a young child, 3 or 4, seeing an Ad on TV for a bottle of Orange Juice. The person in the Ad pored juice from the bottle, filling 3 tall glasses with orange juice, each much larger than the bottle itself. I didn&#39;t understand at the time that the Ad was demonstrating concentrated orange juice, that it was using camera trickery to make it seem the little bottle directly poured 3 big glasses of orange juice. To me, it seemed like magic, the bottle was bigger on the inside than the outside. So I wanted that orange orange juice bottle!<br><br>So pestered my mother to buy this magic physics defying bottle of orange juice, she grudgingly bought the bottle of orange juice and we went to the kitchen. She started to pore juice into a glass, but it filled only one glass half way. I was remember feeling very disappointed, realising this bottle was not magically violating the laws of physics. Given the fact this early childhood memory is so clear shows you how excited I was, and how disappointed I was<br><br>So what does this mean for a 3 to 4 year old&#39;s idea of size and volume? Well by that age, it seems I had an idea of volume and size similar to an adult, but thought this one bottle could break those rules."
OtngSHtz-cc,The Cat of course she sees it as nonsense. These kids are plenty old enough to understand that they can&#39;t fit inside of small toys. Duh.
OtngSHtz-cc,"@Doodle Draws I mean… it&#39;s better like that, the sjw would have raided that one"
OtngSHtz-cc,The next video is actually about that and the cowards turned the comments off god damn

OtngSHtz-cc,Blue’s clues thinking chair.
OtngSHtz-cc,Safaa Mohamed <br>Me too! Lol
OtngSHtz-cc,I&#39;m so glad someone else noticed!!!!
OtngSHtz-cc,@Kylen Small but they had just been in a room where they were prompted to play with the big versions in that way. If they had only been put in the room with the small toys from the beginning I&#39;m pretty sure not one child would try to insert themselves into the car or bed. Theyd probably just push the car around or find a doll to put in the little bed. They had basically been contextually encouraged to try doing the same things with the smaller ones to see if it worked.
OtngSHtz-cc,"Yea but the way you play with a toy car (by pushing it around) is way different than playing with a drivable car. If someone tells you to play with the toy miniature, you gonna try to get in?"
OtngSHtz-cc,@Magnetic Moon ☽ They are 2.5 you have to take into account the fact that they are extremely impressionable. They also might have just thought it was fun to try even if they knew they wouldn&#39;t fit.
OtngSHtz-cc,Read the pinned comment. It was stupid that they said that in this staged reproduction. But they didn&#39;t suggest it in the actual study.
OtngSHtz-cc,"@Magnetic Moon ☽ should it really?   that is the nature of play you think?  &quot;pretend  something is other than it is? what ridiculousness is this? I&#39;m an entirely imaginary child that uses only logic and cold hard facts, sirrah!&quot;"
OtngSHtz-cc,@Random Nerd yup i for one have never ever seen an adult attempt to play in/on nor attempt or pretend to attempt to wear something that is obviously too small for them. <br>oh....  hold...  on......
OtngSHtz-cc,"Hil S - she was probably thinking &#39;Why have you taken all my fun, big toys, you bastards!&#39;"
OtngSHtz-cc,Hil S in the original experiment that did this. The some children were encouraged and others were not. The ones that were not encouraged did try to use the toy-scaled objects similar to the child-scaled objects.

OtngSHtz-cc,"The results wouldn&#39;t really change though, this just makes the testing more efficient than having the chance of the kids not even touching the toys at all."
OtngSHtz-cc,Tek Rekts<br>In science results are not about what&#39;s interesting or not. It&#39;s entirely about what&#39;s accurate or not. I would prefer 1000s of boring results that are accurate than 1 exciting result that&#39;s inaccurate. The accurate ones are useful in prediction making and application.
OtngSHtz-cc,Yes
OtngSHtz-cc,If they did that they wouldn&#39;t have any interesting results.
OtngSHtz-cc,The exact same thing I was thinking. This experiment is bogus!
OtngSHtz-cc,exactly!! She wasn&#39;t supposed to tell the little girl anything and was just supposed to observe smh
OtngSHtz-cc,"this is not the experiment, and it doesn&#39;t invalidate it anyway, unless it was only performed with prompting and without repetition, in which case it&#39;s not really valid in the first place"
OtngSHtz-cc,@Niyah  babies love trying to get into small spaces but im sure that at 3 they have some sense of scale. ive had 7 siblings lol
OtngSHtz-cc,"thats immediately what i thought. anyways, the mini toys are there. whats a kid supposed to do, just stand there and look at the adult as if saying &quot;um excuse me, these toys CANT be played with&quot;"
OtngSHtz-cc,I agree! I thought the same thing!
OtngSHtz-cc,@Joe Winiecki I legit don&#39;t even remember commenting to this video. Lol
OtngSHtz-cc,You probably want your 8 years back now
OtngSHtz-cc,How do you feel about those 2 and a half minutes now that 6years have passed?
OtngSHtz-cc,"Too bad, you’ve sacrificed them to the void already"
OtngSHtz-cc,Along with the amount of brain cells I lost
OtngSHtz-cc,@Davy K me2 lol
OtngSHtz-cc,"@Arthur Edens <br>The Stanford prison experiment didn&#39;t try to say that people would misuse their power if encouraged to, it said they would misuse their power naturally because they have it, which was completely negated by the fact that they were encouraged to misuse their power. That&#39;s an example in which the actual details of the experiment are misused to claim something it didn&#39;t prove. This baby experiment is not claiming to prove something it didn&#39;t actually provide evidence for."
OtngSHtz-cc,@Random Nerd This isn&#39;t the Stanford Prison Experiment
OtngSHtz-cc,@Arthur Edens <br>You dont understand scientific studies. You seem to have this idea for an experiment to have valid results a person must be left to their own devices. That&#39;s only true for SOME experiments. If a study is studying when a person might disobey and order to do a cruel thing then it&#39;s not a matter of &quot;They told them to do it so its invalid&quot;.
OtngSHtz-cc,@NicolaMonk But the children give a double take to the adult &quot;Really? Okay if you say so&quot;
OtngSHtz-cc,"I thought the same thing when I saw the girl&#39;s expression once she&#39;d pulled the car up her leg as far as she could - she smiled to show that she knew this was kind of silly and this was just a playful thing to do. This action did not demonstrate that she truly thought she could fit in the car; she was pretending, after being prompted to do this."
OtngSHtz-cc,"@Jeff Peng I would still try to get in it if I thought the small version of my car was a toy, and I was comfortable playing like a child with it."
OtngSHtz-cc,It’s a good thing we’re here to peer review it
OtngSHtz-cc,Erik<br>If the adults are encouraging the decision path of the child each time but asking them to pretend the mini is the full size then it wouldn&#39;t matter if they did it with all the children on Earth. The result would be and should be considered biased. The adults shouldn&#39;t have even been in the room.
OtngSHtz-cc,Jeff Peng<br>The point of the experiment is to see if the kids have a sense of scale. By encouraging the kids to play with the miniatures like the full size invalidates the results. It pushing the kids towards certain results. What they should be doing is let the kids free in a room 1 by 1 with the full size toys without any instructions. Observe how they interact with the toys. Then move them to a 2nd room where they have the miniatures and again give them no instructions and observe what they do. We can see when the kids 1st walk in they recognize something is wrong but before they had enough time to process it all and come to a conclusion the adults began influencing the kid&#39;s path. Experiments must remove the observers and outside influences as much as possible especially when you&#39;re dealing with things like this.
OtngSHtz-cc,You wanna say it again?
OtngSHtz-cc,"Andi Lein this made me laugh! Because, of course, it is true!"

aFIpQLYMGXY,School shootings.
aFIpQLYMGXY,Thanks for being a good mother and making the right decisions!
aFIpQLYMGXY,"Yeah. When I was grounded and my dad took my phone and my computer and wouldn&#39;t let me watch TV, I started listening to the radio on my clock and just drew. Did that for a week while he had my stuff. Didn&#39;t like it, but I dealt with it."
aFIpQLYMGXY,What are you talking about. Indian created few exactly the same apps like tiktok. Indian copy tiktok to continue with what tiktok was good in
aFIpQLYMGXY,I feel like I lost my ex and kid because of the everyone
aFIpQLYMGXY,RIGHT?!! GEEZ it&#39;s so annoying when parents are upset about choices they made!! It&#39;s like calling your kid fat when you&#39;re the one that buys the food
aFIpQLYMGXY,You know!!! Smh!!!
aFIpQLYMGXY,"Tik tok can be found on Instagram, YouTube, Facebook… it’s everywhere"
aFIpQLYMGXY,Clap clap clap 👏🏻
aFIpQLYMGXY,@Cho Biden If they didn&#39;t do an investigation on this- I swear I would have never known...
aFIpQLYMGXY,Groundbreaking revelation here.

m_wc_-dmxyk,"@Gregory B. Sadler Gotcha, thanks."
m_wc_-dmxyk,It has to do with determining it in the circumstances
m_wc_-dmxyk,You’re very welcome!
m_wc_-dmxyk,Glad you enjoyed it
m_wc_-dmxyk,You&#39;re very welcome!
m_wc_-dmxyk,Happy to read you found it useful
m_wc_-dmxyk,You’re welcome. Not sure making the same comment does anything though!
m_wc_-dmxyk,You&#39;re welcome!
m_wc_-dmxyk,@Coffee Smug I think his project is fine. I&#39;d spend some time with the Stoic texts and for the time being drop this obsession with shoehorning everything into &quot;ethical normativity&quot;.   That&#39;s really quite enough time I&#39;ve given to this conversation
m_wc_-dmxyk,"@Gregory B. Sadler Well you mentioned Lawrence C. Becker&#39;s New Stoicism book. He&#39;s trying to justify Stoic ethics, same thing I&#39;m talking about with ethical normativity. So its not like academics aren&#39;t interested in Stoic metaethics. Do you like disagree with this project or think its somehow not helpful in understanding ancient Stoics?"
m_wc_-dmxyk,"@Coffee Smug Again, you&#39;re making a lot of assumptions that are getting in your own way."
m_wc_-dmxyk,"@Gregory B. Sadler When I read Stoics they are really inspiring and provide commonsense wisdom how to handle normal every day situations with calm mind. But surely that&#39;s not the whole story. I don&#39;t think its controversial to say that virtue ethics (which Stoic ethics is part of) is suppose to provide normative standard as in how we ought to behave or give guidance for living a good life beyond self-help slogans, right? That&#39;s what I mean by genuine normativity that Stoicism is ethical theory and not reducible to something like self-help or cognitive therapy (although it contributes a lot to those, I&#39;m big fan of Donald Robertson)."
m_wc_-dmxyk,"I’d say you’ll want to question all those dogmatic assertions you’re making there. And then, once you realize you don’t have to make them, not only will those worries go away, you’ll be in a better position to study the Stoics"
